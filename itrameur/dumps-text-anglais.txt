   [IMG]A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia [IMG]The original Encyclopédie (1752) used a tree diagram to
   show the way in which its subjects were ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the
   hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a
   "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree,
   with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are
   listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member
   is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting node. But the
   converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root
   node.

   The names of relationships between nodes model the kinship terminology of
   family relations. The gender-neutral names "parent" and "child" have
   largely displaced the older "father" and "son" terminology. The term
   "uncle" is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the
   parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms like
   "ommer".^[1]

     * A node's "parent" is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e.
       closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
     * "Sibling" ("brother" or "sister") nodes share the same parent node.
     * A node's "uncles" (sometimes "ommers") are siblings of that node's
       parent.
     * A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an
       "ancestor". The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of the
       ancestor node.

   In the example, "encyclopedia" is the parent of "science" and "culture",
   its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children of "culture",
   which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also,
   "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of "science",
   "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and "craft", as
   leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a
   language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example
   being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase,
   with each in turn having other components which have other components),
   the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees
   of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the
   Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any
   other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

   For a formal definition see set theory, and for a generalization in which
   children are not necessarily successors, see prefix order.

Representing trees[edit]

   There are many ways of visually representing tree structures. Almost
   always, these boil down to variations, or combinations, of a few basic
   styles:

  Classical node-link diagrams[edit]

   Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line
   segments:

   encyclopedia
   /         \       
   culture   science 
   /   \     
   art craft 

  Nested sets[edit]

   Nested sets that use enclosure or containment to show parenthood; examples
   include TreeMaps, fractal maps, and Euler diagrams:

   [IMG]   encyclopedia  
   [IMG]                 [IMG]  
   [IMG] culture                
   [IMG]         [IMG] science 
   art   craft         

  Layered "icicle" diagrams[edit]

   Layered "icicle" diagrams that use alignment/adjacency.

   +-----------------------+
   | encyclopedia          |
   |-----------------------|
   | culture     | science |
   |-------------+---------|
   | art | craft |         |
   +-----------------------+

  Outlines and tree views[edit]

   Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called "outlines" or
   "tree views".

   An outline:

           encyclopedia

                        culture

                                     art
                                     craft

                        science

   A tree view:

     * encyclopedia
          * culture
               * art
               * craft
          * science

  Nested parentheses[edit]

   See also: Newick format and Dyck language

   A correspondence to nested parentheses was first noticed by Sir Arthur
   Cayley:

   ((art,craft)culture,science)encyclopedia
   or
   encyclopedia(culture(art,craft),science)

  Radial trees[edit]

   See also: Radial tree

   Trees can also be represented radially:

   art     craft 
         \ /     
   culture 
   |       
   encyclopedia
   |       
   science

   Tree Equity Score
   Ensuring tree cover in cities is equitably distributed
   Photo: Rob Crandall / Shutterstock
   Using Data Tools to Create Tree Equity

   The story is the same in nearly every city across the United States. With
   few exceptions, trees are sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged and
   neighborhoods of color and more prominent in wealthier, whiter
   neighborhoods. Redlining policies, dating back to the 1930s, helped
   lay the groundwork for this inequity.

   American Forests is focused on addressing this inequity by focusing
   resources in neighborhoods of highest need. It’s our moral imperative to
   do so, given how many life-saving and quality of life benefits trees
   provide people. That is why we are working to create Tree Equity, which is
   about ensuring that all people experience the benefits of trees. One of
   the ways we are doing this is with our Tree Equity Score tool. It provides
   a social-equity-focused narrative, goals and a guide path for building
   understanding, commitment and action around Tree Equity. It is also free
   and easy to access.

Where is Tree Equity Score Available?

   Tree Equity Score covers all urban areas in United States, including
   Hawai’i and Alaska. 80% of the population lives in urban areas, which
   means over 260 million people can find a score for their neighborhood.

   See Your City's Tree Equity Score
   What Do the Scores Mean?
   Each score indicates whether there are enough trees in a neighborhood for
   everyone to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that
   trees provide. Scores are based on tree canopy, surface temperature,
   income, employment, race, age, language and health factors. A
   0-to-100-point system makes it easy to understand how a community fares.

Who Can Use Tree Equity Score?

   Tree Equity Score can be used by neighborhood organizations,
   U.S. congressional leaders and everybody in between. And it can be used by
   a variety of sectors, such as urban forestry and public health, given the
   role trees play in slowing climate change and improving health and
   wellbeing. Some of the uses are:

   Advocacy
   Make the case for federal, state and local policies, programs and funding
   related to protecting existing trees and planting new trees. The Tucson
   City Council used the methodology from Tree Equity Score to create a
   mapping tool for making decisions about how to invest in green
   infrastructure, such as tree planting and green stormwater basin
   installations.
   City Planning
   Urban land-use planners and others can use the scores to decide where and
   how to invest in forestry and infrastructure. The Tucson City Council and
   Mayor Regina Romero agreed in April 2021 to adopt the Tucson Tree Equity
   Score as the primary tool to prioritize investments for the city’s urban
   forestry initiative and infrastructure projects.
   Forestry Programs
   Use the scores to take a fresh look at an existing urban forestry program.
   Does the program prioritize planting trees in low-scoring neighborhoods?
   Scores can help track progress related to urban forestry programs and
   initiatives.

   [IMG]An abstract syntax tree for the following code for the Euclidean
   algorithm:

 while b ≠ 0:
     if a @gt; b:
         a := a - b
     else:
         b := b - a
 return a

   An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science
   to represent the structure of a program or code snippet. It is a tree
   representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source
   code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a
   construct occurring in the text. It is sometimes called just a syntax
   tree.

   The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every
   detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or
   content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit
   in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate
   nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then statement
   may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

   This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees,
   traditionally designated parse trees. Parse trees are typically built by a
   parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once
   built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent
   processing, e.g., contextual analysis.

   Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program
   transformation systems.

Application in compilers[edit]

   Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to
   represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of
   the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an
   intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the
   compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the
   compiler.

  Motivation[edit]

   An AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the
   compilation process:

     * An AST can be edited and enhanced with information such as properties
       and annotations for every element it contains. Such editing and
       annotation is impossible with the source code of a program, since it
       would imply changing it.
     * Compared to the source code, an AST does not include inessential
       punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.).
     * An AST usually contains extra information about the program, due to
       the consecutive stages of analysis by the compiler. For example, it
       may store the position of each element in the source code, allowing
       the compiler to print useful error messages.

   ASTs are needed because of the inherent nature of programming languages
   and their documentation. Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order
   to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a
   context-free grammar (CFG). However, there are often aspects of
   programming languages that a CFG can't express, but are part of the
   language and are documented in its specification. These are details that
   require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example,
   if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the
   names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a
   language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually
   requires some context. Another example is duck typing, where the type of
   an element can change depending on context. Operator overloading is yet
   another case where correct usage and final function are context-dependent.

  Design[edit]

   The design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler
   and its expected features.

   Core requirements include the following:

     * Variable types must be preserved, as well as the location of each
       declaration in source code.
     * The order of executable statements must be explicitly represented and
       well defined.
     * Left and right components of binary operations must be stored and
       correctly identified.
     * Identifiers and their assigned values must be stored for assignment
       statements.

   These requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST.

   Some operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms
   for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily
   large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from
   the command shell. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in
   such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition
   of an unknown quantity of children.

   To support compiler verification it should be possible to unparse an AST
   into source code form. The source code produced should be sufficiently
   similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon
   recompilation. The AST is used intensively during semantic analysis, where
   the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and
   the language. The compiler also generates symbol tables based on the AST
   during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows
   verification of the correctness of the program.

   After verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code
   generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate
   representation (IR), sometimes called an intermediate language, for the
   code generation.

Other usages[edit]

  AST differencing[edit]

   AST differencing, or for short tree differencing, consists of computing
   the list of differences between two ASTs.^[1] This list of differences is
   typically called an edit script. The edit script directly refers to the
   AST of the code. For instance, an edit action may result in the addition
   of a new AST node representing a function.

  Clone detection[edit]

   An AST is a powerful abstraction to perform code clone detection.^[2]

   [IMG]Parse tree to SAAB

   A parse tree or parsing tree^[1] or derivation tree or concrete syntax
   tree is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of
   a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree
   itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical
   syntax, the term syntax tree is more common.

   Concrete syntax trees reflect the syntax of the input language, making
   them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming.
   Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse
   trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of
   constituents.

   Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency
   relation of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) or the
   dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated
   for sentences in natural languages (see natural language processing), as
   well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming
   languages.

   A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in
   transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic
   expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the
   form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated
   by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further
   transformational rules.^[2] A set of possible parse trees for a
   syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a "parse forest."^[3]

Nomenclature[edit]

   [IMG]A simple parse tree

   A parse tree is made up of nodes and branches.^[4] In the picture the
   parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of
   the leaf nodes (John, ball, the, hit). In a parse tree, each node is
   either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. In the above example, S
   is a root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, while John, ball, the, and hit
   are all leaf nodes.

   Nodes can also be referred to as parent nodes and child nodes. A parent
   node is one which has at least one other node linked by a branch under it.
   In the example, S is a parent of both NP and VP. A child node is one which
   has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch
   of the tree. Again from our example, hit is a child node of V.

   A nonterminal function is a function (node) which is either a root or a
   branch in that tree whereas a terminal function is a function (node) in a
   parse tree which is a leaf.

   For binary trees (where each parent node has two immediate child nodes),
   the number of possible parse trees for a sentence with n words is given by
   the Catalan number C_{n}.

Constituency-based parse trees[edit]

   The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars (phrase
   structure grammars) distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes.
   The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar,
   while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories. The image below
   represents a constituency-based parse tree; it shows the syntactic
   structure of the English sentence John hit the ball:

   Parse tree PSG

   The parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each
   of the leaf nodes (John, hit, the, ball). The following abbreviations are
   used in the tree:

                           * S for sentence, the top-level structure in this
                             example

                           * NP for noun phrase. The first (leftmost) NP, a
                             single noun "John", serves as the subject of the
                             sentence. The second one is the object of the
                             sentence.

                           * VP for verb phrase, which serves as the
                             predicate

                           * V for verb. In this case, it's a transitive verb
                             hit.

                           * D for determiner, in this instance the definite
                             article "the"

                           * N for noun

   Each node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf
   node.^[5] A root node is a node that does not have any branches on top of
   it. Within a sentence, there is only ever one root node. A branch node is
   a parent node that connects to two or more child nodes. A leaf node,
   however, is a terminal node that does not dominate other nodes in the
   tree. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, and John (N), hit
   (V), the (D), and ball (N) are all leaf nodes. The leaves are the lexical
   tokens of the sentence. A parent node is one that has at least one other
   node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both N
   and VP. A child node is one that has at least one node directly above it
   to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, hit is a
   child node of V. The terms mother and daughter are also sometimes used for
   this relationship.

Dependency-based parse trees[edit]

   The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars^[6] see all nodes
   as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between
   terminal and non-terminal categories. They are simpler on average than
   constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes. The
   dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows:

                                     Parse tree DG

   This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories (S, VP, and NP) seen in the
   constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree,
   constituent structure is acknowledged. Any complete sub-tree of the tree
   is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the
   subject noun John and the object noun phrase the ball as constituents just
   like the constituency-based parse tree does.

   The constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the
   additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse
   trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate.

Phrase markers[edit]

   Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early transformational
   generative grammar, as developed by Noam Chomsky and others. A phrase
   marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by
   applying phrase structure rules. Then, this application may undergo
   further transformations.

   Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees (as in the above
   section on constituency-based parse trees), but are often given instead in
   the form of "bracketed expressions", which occupy less space in the
   memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the
   constituency-based tree given above may be something like :

           {\displaystyle [_{S}\ [_{\mathit {N}}\ {\text{John}}]\ [_{\mathit
           {VP}}\ [_{V}\ {\text{hit}}]\ [_{\mathit {NP}}\ [_{\mathit {D}}\
           {\text{the}}]\ [_{N}\ {\text{ball}}]]]]}

   As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount
   of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points
   that the query author wishes to illustrate.

                              What is Syntax Tree?

   Compiler DesignProgramming LanguagesComputer Programming

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Tree in which each leaf node describes an operand @amp; each interior node an
   operator. The syntax tree is shortened form of the Parse Tree.

   Example1 − Draw Syntax Tree for the string a + b ∗ c − d.

   Rules for constructing a syntax tree

   Each node in a syntax tree can be executed as data with multiple fields.
   In the node for an operator, one field recognizes the operator and the
   remaining field includes a pointer to the nodes for the operands. The
   operator is known as the label of the node. The following functions are
   used to create the nodes of the syntax tree for the expressions with
   binary operators. Each function returns a pointer to the recently
   generated node.

     * mknode (op, left, right) − It generates an operator node with label op
       and two field including pointers to left and right.

     * mkleaf (id, entry) − It generates an identifier node with label id and
       the field including the entry, a pointer to the symbol table entry for
       the identifier.

     * mkleaf (num, val) − It generates a number node with label num and a
       field including val, the value of the number. For example, construct a
       syntax tree for an expression a − 4 + c. In this sequence, p_1, p_2, …
       . . p_5are pointers to the symbol table entries for identifier 'a' and
       'c' respectively.

 p_1− mkleaf (id, entry a);
 p_2− mkleaf (num, 4);
 p_3− mknode ( ′−′, p_1, p_2)
 p_4− mkleaf(id, entry c)
 p_5− mknode(′+′, p_3, p_4);

   The tree is generated in a bottom-up fashion. The function calls mkleaf
   (id, entry a) and mkleaf (num 4) construct the leaves for a and 4. The
   pointers to these nodes are stored using p_1and p_2. The call mknodes
   (′−′, p_1, p_2 ) then make the interior node with the leaves for a and 4
   as children. The syntax tree will be

   Syntax Directed Translation of Syntax Trees

   Production        Semantic Action                              
   E → E^(1) + E^(2) {E. VAL = Node (+, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL)}  
   E → E^(1) ∗ E^(2) {E. VAL = Node (∗, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL)}) 
   E → (E^(1))       {E. VAL = E^(1). VAL}                        
   E → E^(1)         {E. VAL = UNARY (−, E^(1). VAL}              
   E → id            {E. VAL = Leaf (id)}                         

   Node (+, 𝐄^(𝟏), 𝐕𝐀𝐋, 𝐄^(𝟐). 𝐕𝐀𝐋) will create a node labeled +.

   E^(1). VAL @amp;E^(2). VAL are left @amp; right children of this node.

   Similarly, Node (∗, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL) will make the syntax as −

   Function UNARY (−, E^(1). VAL)will make a node – (unary minus) @amp; E^(1).
   VAL will be the only child of it.

   Function LEAF (id) will create a Leaf node with label id.

   Example2 − Construct a syntax tree for the expression.

   a = b ∗ −c + d

   Solution

   Example3 − Construct a syntax tree for a statement.

   If a = b then b = 2 * c

   Solution

   Example4 − Consider the following code. Draw its syntax Tree

   If x @gt; 0 then x = 2 * (a + 1) else x = x + 1.

   Example5 − Draw syntax tree for following arithmetic expression a * (b +
   c) – d /2. Also, write given expression in postfix form.

   Postfix Notation

   a b c + * d 2 / -

   A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart
   representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More
   detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as
   genograms.

Representations of family history[edit]

   Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a
   pedigree or ancestry chart. Family trees are often presented with the
   oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at
   the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an
   individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a
   tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry
   charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear
   to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the
   descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these
   formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular
   surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include
   all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which
   represents the reliance on marriage to link dynasties together.

   The passage of time can also be included to illustrate ancestry and
   descent. A time scale is often used, expanding radially across the center,
   divided into decades. Children of the parent form branches around the
   center and their names are plotted in their birth year on the time scale.
   Spouses' names join children's names and nuclear families of parents and
   children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are
   often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the
   natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there
   can be great great grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living
   relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear
   adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a
   living family tree.^[citation needed]

   The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse
   in medieval art,^[1] used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms
   of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical
   use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely
   patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods
   in Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium ("On the Genealogy of the Gods
   of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.^[2]

Common formats[edit]

   In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as
   a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and
   document ancestry and descent.

  Ahnentafel[edit]

   Main article: Ahnentafel
   [IMG]An ahnentafel family tree displaying an ancestor chart of Sigmund
   Christoph, Graf von Zeil und Trauchburg

   An Ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table") is a genealogical numbering
   system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of
   ascent:

    1. Subject (or proband)
    2. Father
    3. Mother
    4. Paternal grandfather
    5. Paternal grandmother
    6. Maternal grandfather
    7. Maternal grandmother

   and so on, back through the generations. Apart from the subject or
   proband, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male,
   and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this scheme, the number of any
   person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is
   double the person's number plus one. This system can also be displayed as
   a tree:

  Fan chart[edit]

   name cloud gramplet on the bottom

   A fan chart features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the
   subject is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each
   side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth.
   Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

Graph theory[edit]

   While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in
   general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since
   distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor
   on both their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must
   be born before their child, an individual cannot be their own ancestor,
   and thus there are no loops. In this regard, ancestry forms a directed
   acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent
   (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son
   relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry
   chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and
   one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on
   the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a
   person can have any number of children or none at all.

Notable examples[edit]

   [IMG]Family trees are an age-old phenomenon. This example dates from the
   sixteenth century.^[3]

   Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and
   cultures throughout the world.

  Africa[edit]

   In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from King
   Solomon via the Queen of Sheba. Through this claim, the family traced
   their descent back to the House of David.

   The genealogy of Ancient Egyptian ruling dynasties was recorded from the
   beginnings of the Pharaonic era c. 3000 BC to the end of the Ptolomaic
   Kingdom; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family
   lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

   Elsewhere in Africa, oral traditions of genealogical recording
   predominate. Members of the Keita dynasty of Mali, for example, have had
   their pedigrees sung by griots during annual ceremonies since the 14th
   century. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, many ruling clans—most notably those
   descended from Oduduwa—claim descent from the legendary King Kisra. Here
   too, pedigrees are recited by griots attached to the royal courts.^[4]

  The Americas[edit]

   In some pre-contact Native American civilizations, genealogical records of
   ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over
   several centuries or longer.

  East Asia[edit]

   There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but
   these do not form a single, unified family tree. Additionally, it is
   unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become
   mythological.

   In Japan, the ancestry of the Imperial Family is traced back to the
   mythological origins of Japan. The connection to persons from the
   established historical record only begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

   The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher
   and educator Confucius (551–479 BC), who is descended from King Tang
   (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and
   includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving
   more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and
   revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was
   printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation
   Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the
   Chinese thinker. This latest edition was expected to include some 1.3
   million living members who are scattered around the world today.^[5]

  Europe and West Asia[edit]

   Before the Dark Ages, in the Greco-Roman world, some reliable pedigrees
   dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first
   millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further.
   Roman clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure
   of their society and were the basis of their intricate system of personal
   names. However, there was a break in the continuity of record-keeping at
   the end of Classical Antiquity. Records of the lines of succession of the
   Popes and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have
   survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single
   families. Refer to descent from antiquity.

   Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West Asian origin can
   reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first
   millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity
   or mythological ancestors. In Europe, for example, the pedigree of Niall
   Noígíallach would be a contender for the longest, through Conn of the
   Hundred Battles (fl. 123 AD)^[citation needed]; in the legendary history
   of Ireland, he is further descended from Breogán, and ultimately from
   Adam, through the sons of Noah.

   Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which
   includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a
   13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and
   purportedly back to the legendary King David, as documented by Neil
   Rosenstein in his book The Lurie Legacy.^[6] The 1999 edition of the
   Guinness Book of Records recorded the Lurie family in the "longest
   lineage" category as one of the oldest-known living families in the world
   today.^[7]

   Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in
   religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent
   from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In
   the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical
   persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. Also according to
   the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed
   at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common
   Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the
   Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad
   greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new
   dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their
   legitimacy.

  Elsewhere[edit]

   Elsewhere, in many human cultures, clan and tribal associations are based
   on claims of common ancestry, although detailed documentation of those
   origins is often very limited.

  Global[edit]

   Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022,
   scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that
   unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history,
   ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for
   estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked
   trees along the genome, a tree-sequence,^[clarification needed] which has
   been described as the largest "human family tree".^[8]^[9]^[10]

Other uses[edit]

   The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced "family trees" of
   rock bands. In this instance, the entries represent a membership of
   certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family
   relationships. Several books have been produced with his family
   trees,^[11] which in turn have led to a BBC television series about them,
   including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.^[12]

   Another common use is in the creation of episcopal trees in Christian
   traditions that believe in apostolic succession. In this case, the
   connection is not made through blood, but through the order of succession
   of bishops.

   Christmas tree decorated with lights, stars and glass balls. Wrapped
   presents are under treeChristmas tree decorated with lights, stars, and
   glass balls [IMG]Glade jul by Viggo Johansen (1891) [IMG]Typical North
   American family decorating Christmas tree (c. 1970s)

   A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such
   as a spruce, pine or fir, or an artificial tree of similar appearance,
   associated with the celebration of Christmas.^[1]

   The custom was developed in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia), where Protestant
   Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.^[2]^[3]^[4] The tree
   was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples,
   wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".^[2] Moravian Christians began to
   illuminate Christmas trees with candles,^[5] which were often replaced by
   Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.^[6] Today, there is
   a wide variety of traditional and modern ornaments, such as garlands,
   baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or star might be placed at the
   top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem,
   respectively, from the Nativity.^[7]^[8] Edible items such as gingerbread,
   chocolate, and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from
   the tree's branches with ribbons. The Christmas tree has been historically
   regarded as a custom of the Lutheran Churches and only in 1982 did the
   Catholic Church erect the Vatican Christmas Tree.^[9]

   In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected
   on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve
   depending on the country;^[10] customs of the same faith hold that the two
   traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree,
   are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day,
   Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some
   denominations.^[10]^[11]

   The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the "Yule-tree", especially
   in discussions of its folkloric origins.^[12]^[13]^[14]

History[edit]

  Origin of the modern Christmas tree[edit]

   [IMG]Martin Luther is depicted with his family and friends in front of a
   Christmas tree on Christmas Eve

   Modern Christmas trees originated in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia) during the
   Renaissance in early modern Europe.^[2]^[3] Its 16th-century origins are
   sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who
   is said to have first added lighted candles to an evergreen
   tree.^[15]^[16]^[17] The Christmas tree was first recorded to be used by
   German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a
   Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1539, under
   the leadership of the Protestant Reformer Martin Bucer.^[18]^[19] The
   Moravian Christians put lighted candles on those trees."^[5]^[20] The
   earliest known firmly dated representation of a Christmas tree is on the
   keystone sculpture of a private home in Turckheim, Alsace (then part of
   the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, today France), with the date
   1576.^[21]

  Possible predecessors[edit]

   Modern Christmas trees have been related to the "tree of paradise" of
   medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration
   and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree
   decorated with apples (representing fruit from the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil and thus to the original sin that Christ took away) and
   round white wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as
   a setting for the play.^[6] Like the Christmas crib, the Paradise tree was
   later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as
   shiny red balls.^[13]^[14]^[22]^[23]^[24]^[25]

     Fir trees decorated with apples served as the central prop for the
     paradise play, a kind of folk religious drama often performed on
     December 24 These props were called paradise trees, and some researchers
     believe they were the forerunners of the Christmas tree

   ^[26]

   At the end of the Middle Ages, an early predecessor appears referred in
   the 15th century Regiment of the Cistercian Alcobaça Monastery in
   Portugal. The Regiment of the local high-Sacristans of the Cistercian
   Order refers to what may be considered the oldest references to the
   Christmas tree: "Note on how to put the Christmas branch, scilicet: On the
   Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you
   shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of
   the laurel, specifically as you have seen, and in every orange you shall
   put a candle, and hang the Branch by a rope in the pole, which shall be by
   the candle of the high altar."^[27]

   [IMG]Yggdrasil, in Norse cosmology, is an immense and central sacred tree.

   Other sources have offered a connection between the symbolism of the first
   documented Christmas trees in Germany around 1600 and the trees of
   pre-Christian traditions, though this claim has been disputed.^[28]
   According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, "The use of evergreen trees,
   wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the
   ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the
   pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the
   Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at
   the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the
   birds during Christmas time."^[29]

   It is commonly believed that ancient Romans used to decorate their houses
   with evergreen trees to celebrate Saturnalia,^[30] although there are no
   historical records of that.^[31] In the poem Epithalamium by Catullus, he
   tells of the gods decorating the home of Peleus with trees, including
   laurel and cypress. Later Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom speak of
   the use of evergreen trees to adorn Christian houses.^[32]

   The Vikings and Saxons worshiped trees.^[30] The story of Saint Boniface
   cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century
   among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that
   an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how
   its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to
   heaven.^[33]^[a]

  Historical practices by region[edit]

    Estonia, Latvia, and Germany[edit]

   Tallinn Christmas Market in Estonia

   Left: Tallinn Christmas Market in Estonia; Right: Christmas tree with
   Hanukkah Menorah next to it in Pariser Platz

   Customs of erecting decorated trees in winter time can be traced to
   Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era guilds in Northern Germany and
   Livonia. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas
   Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the
   apprentices and children. In Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia), in
   1441, 1442, 1510, and 1514, the Brotherhood of Blackheads erected a tree
   for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now Tallinn) and Riga. On
   the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree
   was taken to the Town Hall Square, where the members of the brotherhood
   danced around it.^[34]

   A Bremen guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with
   "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels, and paper flowers" was erected in the
   guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected
   the dainties on Christmas Day.^[35] In 1584, the pastor and chronicler
   Balthasar Russow in his Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt (1584) wrote of an
   established tradition of setting up a decorated spruce at the market
   square, where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first
   sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

   After the Protestant Reformation, such trees are seen in the houses of
   upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic Christmas
   cribs. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes
   in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern
   tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the
   present-day, the churches and homes of Protestants and Catholics feature
   both Christmas cribs and Christmas trees.^[36]

    Poland[edit]

   Main article: Podłaźniczka
   [IMG]The hanging of a podłaźniczka during Christmastide is an old Polish
   folk custom (2020).

   In Poland, there is a folk tradition dating back to an old Slavic
   pre-Christian custom of suspending a branch of fir, spruce, or pine from
   the ceiling rafters, called podłaźniczka, during the time of the Koliada
   winter festival.^[37] The branches were decorated with apples, nuts,
   acorns, and stars made of straw. In more recent times, the decorations
   also included colored paper cutouts (wycinanki), wafers, cookies, and
   Christmas baubles. According to old pagan beliefs, the branch's powers
   were linked to good harvest and prosperity.^[38]

   The custom was practiced by the peasants until the early 20th century,
   particularly in the regions of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia.^[39] Most
   often the branches were hung above the wigilia dinner table on Christmas
   Eve. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the tradition over time was almost
   completely replaced by the later German practice of decorating a standing
   Christmas tree.^[40]

  18th to early 20th centuries[edit]

    Adoption by European nobility[edit]

   [IMG]German Christmas tree, book illustration (1888)

   In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility
   and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Introduced by Fanny von
   Arnstein and popularized by Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg the
   Christmas tree reached Vienna in 1814 during the Congress of Vienna, and
   the custom spread across Austria in the following years.^[41] In France,
   the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchesse d'Orléans.
   In Denmark, a newspaper company claims that the first attested Christmas
   tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the
   aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to
   the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1865. He had published a
   fairy tale called The Fir-Tree in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir tree
   being used as a Christmas tree.^[42]

    Adoption by country or region[edit]

      Germany[edit]

   [IMG]A German Christmas tree in a room at Versailles turned into a
   military hospital

   By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the
   upper Rhineland, but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles,
   expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th
   century.

   Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas
   tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained
   confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The
   custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way
   of Prussian officials who emigrated there following the Congress of
   Vienna.

   In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of
   German culture and of Gemütlichkeit, especially among emigrants
   overseas.^[43]

   A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's
   decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals
   during the Franco-Prussian War. Only at the start of the 20th century did
   Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit
   form.^[44]

      Slovenia[edit]

   Early Slovenian custom dating back to around the 17th century was to
   suspend the tree either upright or upside-down above the well, a corner of
   the dinner table, in the backyard, or from the fences, modestly decorated
   with fruits or not decorated at all. German brewer Peter Luelsdorf brought
   the first Christmas tree of the current tradition to Slovenia in 1845. He
   set it up in his small brewery inn in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital.
   German officials, craftsmen and merchants quickly spread the tradition
   among the bourgeois population. The trees were typically decorated with
   walnuts, golden apples, carobs, and candles. At first the Catholic
   majority rejected this custom because they considered it a typical
   Protestant tradition. The first decorated Christmas Market was organized
   in Ljubljana already in 1859. However, this tradition was almost unknown
   to the rural population until World War I, after which everyone started
   decorating trees. Spruce trees have a centuries-long tradition in
   Slovenia. After World War II during Yugoslavia period, trees set in the
   public places (towns, squares, and markets) were politically replaced with
   fir trees, a symbol of socialism and Slavic mythology strongly associated
   with loyalty, courage, and dignity. However, spruce retained its
   popularity in Slovenian homes during those years and came back to public
   places after independence.^[45]^[46]^[47]^[48]

      Britain[edit]

   [IMG]An engraving published in the 1840s of Queen Victoria and Prince
   Albert created a craze for Christmas trees.^[49]

   Although the tradition of decorating churches and homes with evergreens at
   Christmas was long established,^[50] the custom of decorating an entire
   small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. The
   German-born Queen Charlotte introduced a Christmas tree at a party she
   gave for children in 1800.^[51] The custom did not at first spread much
   beyond the royal family.^[b] Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with
   it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. In her journal for
   Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote:^[53]

     After dinner [...] we then went into the drawing room near the dining
     room [...] There were two large round tables on which were placed two
     trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being
     placed round the trees [...]

   After Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the
   custom became even more widespread^[54] as wealthier middle-class families
   followed the fashion. In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes
   clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and
   gift-giving.^[55] An illustrated book, The Christmas Tree, describing
   their use and origins in detail, was on sale in December 1844.^[56] On
   2 January 1846 Elizabeth Fielding (née Fox Strangways) wrote from Lacock
   Abbey to William Henry Fox-Talbot: "Constance is extremely busy preparing
   the Bohemian Xmas Tree. It is made from Caroline's^[57] description of
   those she saw in Germany".^[58] In 1847 Prince Albert wrote: "I must now
   seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in
   the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the
   Christmas trees is not less than ours used to be".^[59] A boost to the
   trend was given in 1848^[60] when The Illustrated London News,^[61] in a
   report picked up by other papers,^[62] described the trees in Windsor
   Castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family,
   on its cover. In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was
   widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert
   alluding casually to them,^[63] as well as reporting the accidental death
   of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas
   tree.^[64] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a
   report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every
   family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still
   the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".^[65]

   Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made
   them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up
   specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums "who had never
   seen a Christmas tree" would enjoy one that year.^[66] Anti-German
   sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity^[67] but the
   effect was short-lived,^[68] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas
   trees had spread to all classes.^[69] In 1933 a restriction on the
   importation of foreign trees led to the "rapid growth of a new industry"
   as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially
   viable due to the size of demand.^[70] By 2013 the number of trees grown
   in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately eight million^[71]
   and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the
   Christmas season.

      Georgia[edit]

   [IMG]Decorated Chichilaki at the Orbeliani Palace

   Georgians have their own traditional Christmas tree called Chichilaki,
   made from dried up hazelnut or walnut branches that are shaped to form a
   small coniferous tree.^[72] These pale-colored ornaments differ in height
   from 20 cm (7.9 in) to 3 meters (9.8 ft). Chichilakis are most common in
   the Guria and Samegrelo regions of Georgia near the Black Sea, but they
   can also be found in some stores around the capital of Tbilisi.^[73]
   Georgians believe that Chichilaki resembles the famous beard of St. Basil
   the Great, because Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates St. Basil on 1
   January.

      The Bahamas[edit]

   The earliest reference of Christmas trees being used in The Bahamas dates
   to January 1864 and is associated with the Anglican Sunday Schools in
   Nassau, New Providence: "After prayers and a sermon from the Rev. R.
   Swann, the teachers and children of St. Agnes', accompanied by those of
   St. Mary's, marched to the Parsonage of Rev. J. H. Fisher, in front of
   which a large Christmas tree had been planted for their gratification. The
   delighted little ones formed a circle around it singing "Come follow me to
   the Christmas tree"."^[74] The gifts decorated the trees as ornaments and
   the children were given tickets with numbers that matched the gifts. This
   appears to be the typical way of decorating the trees in the 1860s
   Bahamas. In the Christmas of 1864, there was a Christmas tree put up in
   the Ladies Saloon in the Royal Victoria Hotel for the respectable children
   of the neighbourhood. The tree was ornamented with gifts for the children
   who formed a circle about it and sung the song "Oats and Beans". The gifts
   were later given to the children in the name of Santa Claus.^[75]

      North America[edit]

   [IMG]General and Mrs. Riedesel celebrating Christmas.

   The tradition was introduced to North America in the winter of 1781 by
   Hessian soldiers stationed in the Province of Québec (1763–1791) to
   garrison the colony against American attack. General Friedrich Adolf
   Riedesel and his wife, the Baroness von Riedesel, held a Christmas party
   for the officers at Sorel, Quebec, delighting their guests with a fir tree
   decorated with candles and fruits.^[76]

   The Christmas tree became very common in the United States of America in
   the early nineteenth century. Dating from late 1812 or early 1813, the
   watercolor sketchbooks of John Lewis Krimmel contain perhaps the earliest
   depictions of a Christmas tree in American art, representing a family
   celebrating Christmas Eve in the Moravian tradition.^[77] The first
   published image of a Christmas tree appeared in 1836 as the frontispiece
   to The Stranger's Gift by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the
   Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition
   of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, titled "New Year's Day", by Catherine
   Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her
   mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British royal family with their
   Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in The Illustrated
   London News December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas
   1850, in Godey's Lady's Book. Godey's copied it exactly, except for the
   removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's moustache, to remake the
   engraving into an American scene.^[78] The republished Godey's image
   became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen
   Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince
   Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, "the first
   influential American Christmas tree".^[79] Folk-culture historian Alfred
   Lewis Shoemaker states, "In all of America there was no more important
   medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than Godey's
   Lady's Book". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting
   up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.^[78]

   House Christmas tree in 1889.^[80]

   Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to
   that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims
   that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at
   the Noden-Reed House,^[81] while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is
   also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly
   erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of Lancaster,
   Pennsylvania, recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading
   Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.^[82]
   Other accounts credit Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston, for
   being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a
   Christmas tree.^[83] In 1847, August Imgard, a German immigrant living in
   Wooster, Ohio cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the
   Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his
   house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.^[84]
   German immigrant Charles Minnigerode accepted a position as a professor of
   humanities at the College of William @amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in
   1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of
   the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of
   decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St.
   George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted
   Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.^[85] An 1853 article
   on Christmas customs in Pennsylvania defines them as mostly "German in
   origin", including the Christmas tree, which is "planted in a flower pot
   filled with earth, and its branches are covered with presents, chiefly of
   confectionary, for the younger members of the family." The article
   distinguishes between customs in different states however, claiming that
   in New England generally "Christmas is not much celebrated", whereas in
   Pennsylvania and New York it is.^[86]

   When Edward H. Johnson was vice president of the Edison Electric Light
   Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known
   electrically illuminated Christmas tree at his home in New York City in
   1882. Johnson became the "Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights".^[87]

   The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune O Tannenbaum begin
   "O Christmas tree...", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the German
   word Tannenbaum (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for
   which is instead Weihnachtsbaum.

  1935 to present[edit]

   Under the state atheism of the Soviet Union, the Christmas tree, along
   with the entire celebration of the Christian holiday, was banned in that
   country after the October Revolution. However, the government then
   introduced a New-year spruce (Russian: Новогодняя ёлка,
   romanized: Novogodnyaya yolka) in 1935 for the New Year
   holiday.^[88]^[89]^[90] It became a fully secular icon of the New Year
   holiday: for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of
   Bethlehem Star, but as the Red star. Decorations, such as figurines of
   airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, cosmonauts, and characters of Russian
   fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the
   USSR, with the New Year holiday outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for
   a wide majority of Russian people.^[91]

   The Peanuts TV special A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) was influential on
   the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. Aluminum Christmas trees
   were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the
   TV special and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of
   Christmas. The term Charlie Brown Christmas tree, describing any
   poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV
   special, based on the appearance of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.^[92]

    Public Christmas trees[edit]

   [IMG]An early example of public Christmas tree for the children of
   unemployed parents in Prague (Czech Republic), 1931

   Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns,
   and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as
   the Macy's Great Tree in Atlanta (since 1948), the Rockefeller Center
   Christmas Tree in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at Victoria
   Square in Adelaide.

   The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real
   trees and be compliant with code. Licensed applicants of fire retardant
   solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for
   inspection.

   The United States' National Christmas Tree has been lit each year since
   1923 on the South Lawn of the White House, becoming part of what evolved
   into a major holiday event at the White House. President Jimmy Carter lit
   only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans
   being held hostage in Iran.^[93] The same was true in 1980, except the
   tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages
   had been in captivity.^[93]

   During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree
   in the world was put up every year on the property of the National
   Enquirer in Lantana, Florida. This tradition grew into one of the most
   spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but
   was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late
   1980s.^[94]

   In some cities, a charity event called the Festival of Trees is organized,
   in which multiple trees are decorated and displayed.

   The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end
   of hostilities. After the signing of the Armistice in 1918 the city of
   Manchester sent a tree, and £500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the
   children of the much-bombarded town of Lille in northern France.^[95] In
   some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in
   Trafalgar Square in London, where the City of Oslo, Norway presents a tree
   to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support
   of Norwegian resistance during the Second World War; in Boston, where the
   tree is a gift from the province of Nova Scotia, in thanks for rapid
   deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 ammunition ship explosion
   that leveled the city of Halifax; and in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the
   main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of Bergen, in
   thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen
   from Nazi occupation.^[96] Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to
   Washington, D.C. as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and
   as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the
   US during World War II.^[97]

Customs and traditions[edit]

  Setting up and taking down[edit]

   [IMG]Adding decorations to tree

   Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with
   specific dates; liturgically, this is done through the hanging of the
   greens ceremony.^[98] In many areas, it has become customary to set up
   one's Christmas tree on Advent Sunday, the first day of the Advent
   season.^[99]^[100] Traditionally, however, Christmas trees were not
   brought in and decorated until the evening of Christmas Eve (24 December),
   the end of the Advent season and the start of the twelve days of
   Christmastide.^[101] It is customary for Christians in many localities to
   remove their Christmas decorations on the last day of the twelve days of
   Christmastide that falls on 5 January—Epiphany Eve (Twelfth Night),^[102]
   although those in other Christian countries remove them on Candlemas, the
   conclusion of the extended Christmas-Epiphany season
   (Epiphanytide).^[103]^[104] According to the first tradition, those who
   fail to remember to remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve
   must leave them untouched until Candlemas, the second opportunity to
   remove them; failure to observe this custom is considered
   inauspicious.^[105]^[106]

   [IMG]Christmas ornaments at the Christmas market, Strasbourg

   Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood,
   or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first
   decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries
   in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made
   in Lauscha, Germany, and also garlands of glass beads and tin figures that
   could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations fueled the
   production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay
   molds.

   Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used as
   Christmas tree decorations. Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced
   later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments
   were a specialty of the glass factories in the Thuringian Forest,
   especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a
   large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another
   common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres
   coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further
   coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
   Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom,
   fairy lights) is commonly done. A tree-topper, sometimes an angel but more
   frequently a star, completes the decoration.

   In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping
   strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance
   of a snow-laden tree.

   In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,
   flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There
   were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the
   1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

Symbolism and interpretations[edit]

   The earliest legend of the origin of a fir tree becoming a Christian
   symbol dates back to 723 AD, involving Saint Boniface as he was
   evangelizing Germany.^[107] It is said that at a pagan gathering in
   Geismar where a group of people dancing under a decorated oak tree were
   about to sacrifice a baby in the name of Thor, Saint Boniface took an axe
   and called on the name of Jesus.^[107] In one swipe, he managed to take
   down the entire oak tree, to the crowd's astonishment.^[107] Behind the
   fallen tree was a baby fir tree.^[107] Boniface said, "let this tree be
   the symbol of the true God, its leaves are ever green and will not die."
   The tree's needles pointed to heaven and it was shaped triangularly to
   represent the Holy Trinity.^[107]

   When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the
   top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem.^[7]^[108] It became
   popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order
   to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of
   Jesus.^[8] Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of
   Christmas, the evergreen Christmas tree symbolizes eternal life; the
   candles or lights on the tree represent Christ as the light of the
   world.^[6]^[109]

   Wenzel Zajicek (1908)

   Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and
   50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000
   growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same
   year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas
   trees.^[110] By 2016 that had climbed to $2.04 billion for natural trees
   and a further $1.86 billion for artificial trees. In Europe, 75 million
   trees worth €2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) are harvested annually.^[111]

  Natural trees[edit]

   See also: Christmas tree cultivation

   The most commonly used species are fir (Abies), which have the benefit of
   not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good
   foliage color and scent; but species in other genera are also used.

   In northern Europe most commonly used are:

     * Norway spruce Picea abies (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
     * Silver fir Abies alba
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana
     * Noble fir Abies procera
     * Serbian spruce Picea omorika
     * Scots pine Pinus sylvestris
     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Swiss pine Pinus cembra

   In North America, Central America, South America and Australia most
   commonly used are:

     * Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii
     * Balsam fir Abies balsamea
     * Fraser Fir Abies fraseri
     * Grand fir Abies grandis
     * Guatemalan fir Abies guatemalensis
     * Noble fir Abies procera
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana
     * Red fir Abies magnifica
     * White fir Abies concolor
     * Pinyon pine Pinus edulis
     * Jeffrey pine Pinus jeffreyi
     * Scots pine Pinus sylvestris
     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Norfolk Island pine Araucaria heterophylla
     * Paraná pine Araucaria angustifolia (when young, resembles a Pine tree)

   Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional
   conifers are sometimes used, such as giant sequoia, Leyland cypress,
   Monterey cypress, and eastern juniper. Various types of spruce tree are
   also used for Christmas trees (including the blue spruce and, less
   commonly, the white spruce); but spruces begin to lose their needles
   rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making
   decorating uncomfortable. Virginia pine is still available on some tree
   farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is
   faded. The long-needled eastern white pine is also used there, though it
   is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to
   its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult
   with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes
   used, particularly in Oceania, and in Australia, some species of the
   genera Casuarina and Allocasuarina are also occasionally used as Christmas
   trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata Monterey
   pine. Adenanthos sericeus or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in
   southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. Hemlock species are
   generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor
   needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and
   ornaments.

   Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold
   live with roots and soil, often from a plant nursery, to be stored at
   nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often
   decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and
   sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly,
   the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment
   of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's
   health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree
   out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put
   back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a
   large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the
   survival rate of these trees is low.^[112] However, when done properly,
   replanting provides higher survival rates.^[113]

   European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared
   trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often
   wild-harvested on public lands)^[114] there is a preference for
   close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang
   decorations.

   In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but
   now almost all are commercially grown on tree farms. Almost all Christmas
   trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they
   are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According
   to the United States Department of Agriculture's agriculture census for
   2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree
   market in America, 5,717.09 square kilometres (1,412,724 acres) were
   planted in Christmas trees.^[115]

   The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a 2-metre (7 ft) tree
   takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between eight
   and twelve years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from
   older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold
   to Christmas tree farms at an age of three to four years. The remaining
   development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as
   well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree
   farmer.^[116]

  Artificial trees[edit]

   Main article: Artificial Christmas tree
   [IMG]An artificial Christmas tree

   The first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the
   19th century,^[117]^[118]^[self-published source?] though earlier examples
   exist.^[119] These "trees" were made using goose feathers that were dyed
   green,^[117] as one response by Germans to continued deforestation.^[118]
   Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 5-centimeter
   (2 in) tree to a large 2.5-meter (98 in) tree sold in department stores
   during the 1920s.^[120] Often, the tree branches were tipped with
   artificial red berries which acted as candle holders.^[121]

   Over the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved
   and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created
   the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.^[122]
   Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree,^[118]
   first manufactured in Chicago in 1958,^[123] and later in Manitowoc,
   Wisconsin, where the majority of the trees were produced.^[124] Most
   modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used
   packaging materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC).^[118] Approximately
   10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin;
   despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or
   biodegradable.^[125]

   Other trends developed also in the early 2000s. Optical fiber Christmas
   trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas
   tree.^[126] One Dallas-based company offers "holographic mylar" trees in
   many hues.^[119] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as
   cardboard,^[127] glass,^[128] ceramic or other materials can be found in
   use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became
   popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing
   gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in
   retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.^[129]

   Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th
   century.^[118] Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are
   more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their
   natural alternative.^[118] They are also considered much safer,^[130] as
   natural trees can be a significant fire hazard. Between 2001 and 2007,
   artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to
   17.4 million.^[131] Currently, it is estimated that around 58% of
   Christmas trees used in the United States are artificial, while numbers in
   the United Kingdom are indicated to be around 66%.^[132]

Environmental issues[edit]

   The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing.
   Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more
   environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.^[131] However,
   trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, claim that
   the PVC used in Christmas trees is chemically and mechanically stable and
   does not affect human health and has excellent recyclable
   properties.^[133] Live trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted
   in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for
   wildlife.^[134] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock
   farmers who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are
   excellent fodder.^[135] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops
   can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of
   pesticides.^[136] Concerns have been raised by arborists about people
   cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana for
   Christmas trees.^[137]

   Real or cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and
   used as mulch, wildlife habitat, or used to prevent
   erosion.^[138]^[139]^[140] Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no
   more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb
   while growing.^[141] However, emissions can occur from farming activities
   and transportation. An independent life-cycle assessment study, conducted
   by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural
   tree will generate 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) of greenhouse gases every year (based
   on purchasing 5 km (3.1 mi) from home) whereas the artificial tree will
   produce 48.3 kg (106 lb) over its lifetime.^[142] Some people use living
   Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life
   cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented
   from local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while
   purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local
   tree adoption or urban reforestation services.^[143] Smaller and younger
   trees may be replanted after each season, with the following year running
   up to the next Christmas allowing the tree to carry out further growth.

   The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of
   concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study
   found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from
   lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major
   health risks to young children exist.^[144] A 2008 United States
   Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial
   Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.^[145] The report determined that
   of the fifty million artificial trees in the United States approximately
   twenty million were nine or more years old, the point where dangerous lead
   contamination levels are reached.^[145] A professional study on the
   life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed
   that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least twenty years to
   leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas
   tree.^[142]

Religious issues[edit]

   Under the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union,
   after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other
   religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet
   anti-religious campaign.^[146]^[147]^[88] The League of Militant Atheists
   encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among
   them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays,
   including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be
   the 31st of each month as a replacement.^[148] With the Christmas tree
   being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation,
   people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's
   trees.^[88]^[149] In 1935, the tree was brought back as New Year tree and
   became a secular, not a religious holiday.

   Pope John Paul II introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in
   1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the
   centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican Christmas Tree has become
   an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,^[150] and in 2005
   Pope Benedict XVI spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations
   in Catholic homes.^[151] In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree
   a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of
   life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and
   it reminds Christians of the "tree of life",^[152] an image of Christ, the
   supreme gift of God to humanity.^[153] In the previous year he said:
   "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds
   us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the
   desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand
   down in time the true meaning of Christmas."^[154] The Catholic Church's
   official Book of Blessings has a service for the blessing of the Christmas
   tree in a home.^[155] The Episcopal Church in The Anglican Family Prayer
   Book, which has the imprimatur of The Rt. Rev. Catherine S. Roskam of the
   Anglican Communion, has long had a ritual titled Blessing of a Christmas
   Tree, as well as Blessing of a Crèche, for use in the church and the home;
   family services and public liturgies for the blessing of Christmas trees
   are common in other Christian denominations as well.^[156]^[157]

   Chrismon trees, which find their origin in the Lutheran Christian
   tradition though now used in many Christian denominations such as the
   Catholic Church and Methodist Church, are used to decorate churches during
   the liturgical season of Advent; during the period of Christmastide,
   Christian churches display the traditional Christmas tree in their
   sanctuaries.^[158]

   In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the
   Boston Common a "Holiday Tree" rather than a "Christmas Tree".^[159] The
   name change was reversed after the city was threatened with several
   lawsuits.^[160]

       took away so that the return to Eden-symbolized by the Christmas
       tree-is again possible for humanity.

       Christmas tree [...] originated in western Germany. The main prop of a
       popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with
       apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans
       set up a paradise tree in their homes on 24 December, the religious
       feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung round white discs on it
       (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of Christ's body in the
       Eucharist); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies
       of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of
       Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the
       Christmas pyramid, a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to
       hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a
       star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had
       merged, becoming the Christmas tree.

       locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree
       dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared
       Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a
       young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree
       was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the
       Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the

        December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic
        campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them
        with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve. At the
        beginning, stringent measures were put in place to see off any
        holdover of the old days: Christmas trees, introduced to Russia by
        Tsar Peter The Great in the 17th century, were banned in 1916 by the
        Holy Synod as too German. The Bolsheviks kept the tree ban in place.

        this putative religious revival. Antireligioznik obliged with so many
        articles that it devoted an entire section of its annual index for
        1928 to anti-religious training in the schools. More such material
        followed in 1929, and a flood of it the next year. It recommended
        what Lenin and others earlier had explicitly condemned—carnivals,
        farces, and games to intimidate and purge the youth of religious
        belief. It suggested that pupils campaign against customs associated
        with Christmas (including Christmas trees) and Easter. Some schools,
        the League approvingly reported, staged an anti-religious day on the
        31st of each month. Not teachers but the League's local set the
        programme for this special occasion.

        Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era. To
        keep the custom alive, people decorated New Year's trees instead.

        begun the tradition of using a Chrismon tree in the sanctuary as part
        of the Advent and Christmas celebration. It is important, especially
        for children, that the distinction between this tree and the family
        Christmas tree be clearly made. The Chrismon tree is decorated only
        with clear lights and Chrismons made from white and gold material.
        White, the color of Christmas, is the color of purity and perfection,
        while gold is the color for majesty and glory. The Chrismons are
        ancient symbols for Christ or some part of Christ's ministry: the
        crow, descending down, fish, Celtic cross, Jerusalem cross,
        shepherd's crook, chalice, shell, and others.

   The history of Christmas trees has many roots, ranging from the use of
   evergreens in ancient Egypt and Rome to the German traditions of candlelit
   trees that made its way to America in the 1800s. Discover the history of
   the Christmas tree, from the earliest winter solstice celebrations to
   Queen Victoria’s decorating habits and the annual lighting of the
   Rockefeller Center tree in New York City.

How Did Christmas Trees Start?

   Long before the advent of Christianity, plants and trees that remained
   green all year had a special meaning for people in the winter. Just as
   people today decorate their homes during the festive season with pine,
   spruce, and fir trees, many ancient peoples hung evergreen boughs over
   their doors and windows. In many countries it was believed that evergreens
   would keep away witches, ghosts, evil spirits, and illness.

   History of Christmas Trees

   In the Northern hemisphere, the shortest day and longest night of the year
   falls on December 21 or December 22 and is called the winter solstice.
   Many ancient people believed that the sun was a god and that winter came
   every year because the sun god had become sick and weak. They celebrated
   the solstice because it meant that at last the sun god would begin to get
   well. Evergreen boughs reminded them of all the green plants that would
   grow again when the sun god was strong and summer would return.

   The ancient Egyptians worshipped a god called Ra, who had the head of a
   hawk and wore the sun as a blazing disk in his crown. At the solstice,
   when Ra began to recover from his illness, the Egyptians filled their
   homes with green palms and papyrus reeds, which symbolized for them the
   triumph of life over death.

     Did you know? Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including
     Hawaii and Alaska.

   Early Romans marked the solstice with a feast called Saturnalia in honor
   of Saturn, the god of agriculture. The Romans knew that the solstice meant
   that soon, farms and orchards would be green and fruitful. To mark the
   occasion, they decorated their homes and temples with evergreen boughs.

   In Northern Europe the Druids, the priests of the ancient Celts, also
   decorated their temples with evergreen boughs as a symbol of everlasting
   life. The Vikings in Scandinavia honored the evergreen mistletoe for its
   role in the death of the Balder, a god of light.

Christmas Trees From Germany

   Germany is credited with starting the Christmas tree tradition—as we now
   know it—by the 16th century  when sources record devout Christians
   bringing decorated trees into their homes. Some built Christmas pyramids
   of wood and decorated them with evergreens and candles if wood was scarce.

   It is a widely held belief that Martin Luther, the 16th-century Protestant
   reformer, first added lighted candles to a tree. According to a common
   version of the story, walking home one winter evening, Luther was awed by
   the stars twinkling amidst evergreens. To recapture the scene for his
   family, he erected a tree in the main room and wired its branches with
   lighted candles.

Who Brought Christmas Trees to America?

   Most 19th-century Americans found Christmas trees an oddity. The first
   records of Christmas trees being cut for display comes from the 1820s in
   Pennsylvania’s German community, although trees may have been a tradition
   there even earlier. As early as 1747, Moravian Germans in Pennsylvania had
   a community tree in the form of a wooden pyramid decorated with candles.
   But, as late as the 1840s, Christmas trees were seen as pagan symbols and
   not accepted by most Americans.

   It is not surprising that, like many other festive Christmas customs, the
   tree was adopted so late in America. New England’s first Puritan leaders
   viewed Christmas celebrations as unholy. The pilgrims’s second governor,
   William Bradford, wrote that he tried hard to stamp out “pagan mockery” of
   the observance, penalizing any frivolity.

   In 1659, the General Court of Massachusetts enacted a law making any
   observance of December 25 a penal offense; people were fined for hanging
   decorations. That stern solemnity continued until the influx of German and
   Irish immigrants in the 19th century undermined the Puritan legacy.

   Queen Victoria's Christmas TreeQueen Victoria's Christmas TreeBettmann

   An illustration from a December 1848 edition of the Illustrated London
   News shows Queen Victoria and her family surrounding a Christmas tree.

   In 1846, the popular royals, Queen Victoria and her German Prince, Albert,
   were sketched in the Illustrated London News standing with their children
   around a Christmas tree. Unlike the previous royal family, Victoria was
   very popular with her subjects, and what was done at court immediately
   became fashionable—not only in Britain, but with fashion-conscious East
   Coast American Society. The Christmas tree had arrived.

   By the 1890s Christmas ornaments were arriving from Germany and Christmas
   tree popularity was on the rise around the U.S. It was noted that
   Europeans used small trees about four feet in height, while Americans
   liked their Christmas trees to extend from floor to ceiling.

   The early 20th century saw Americans decorating their trees mainly with
   homemade ornaments, while many German Americans continued to use apples,
   nuts and marzipan cookies. Stringed popcorn was added to trees' decoration
   after being dyed bright colors and interlaced with berries and nuts.
   Electricity brought about Christmas lights, making it possible for
   Christmas trees to glow for days on end. With this, Christmas trees began
   to appear in town squares across the country and having a Christmas tree
   in the home became an American tradition.

   The Invention of Christmas Lights

Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree

   The Rockefeller Center tree is located at Rockefeller Center, west of
   Fifth Avenue from 47th through 51st Streets in New York City.

   The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree dates back to the Depression era,
   with the first tree placed in 1931. It was a small unadorned tree set up
   by construction workers at the center of the construction site. Two years
   later, another tree was placed there, this time with lights.

   These days, the giant Rockefeller Center tree is laden with over 50,000
   Christmas lights. The tallest tree displayed at Rockefeller Center arrived
   in 1999. It was a Norway Spruce that measured 100 feet tall and hailed
   from Killingworth, Connecticut.

Christmas Trees Around the World

   Christmas Trees in Canada
   German settlers began migrating to Canada from the United States in the
   1700s. They brought Canada’s first Christmas trees and, in later
   generations, gingerbread houses and Advent calendars. When Queen
   Victoria’s German husband, Prince Albert, put up a Christmas tree at
   Windsor Castle in 1848, Christmas trees became a widely popular tradition
   throughout England, the United States and Canada.

   Christmas Trees in Mexico
   In most Mexican homes the principal holiday adornment is el Nacimiento
   (Nativity scene). However, a decorated Christmas tree may be incorporated
   in the Nacimiento or set up elsewhere in the home. As purchase of a
   natural pine represents a luxury commodity to most Mexican families, the
   typical arbolito (little tree) is often an artificial one, a bare branch
   cut from a copal tree (Bursera microphylla) or some type of shrub
   collected from the countryside.

   Christmas Trees in Great Britain
   The Norway spruce is the traditional species used to decorate homes in
   Britain. The Norway spruce was a native species in the British Isles
   before the last Ice Age, and was reintroduced here before the 1500s.

   Christmas Trees in Greenland
   Since icy Greenland lacks large native forests, most Christmas trees are
   imported. They are decorated with candles and bright ornaments.

   Christmas Trees in Guatemala
   The Christmas tree has joined the Nacimiento as a popular ornament because
   of the large German population in Guatemala.

   Christmas Trees in Brazil
   Although Christmas falls during the summer in most of Brazil, sometimes
   pine trees are decorated with little pieces of cotton that represent
   falling snow.

   Christmas Trees in Ireland
   Christmas trees are bought anytime in December and decorated with colored
   lights, tinsel, and baubles. Some people favor the angel on top of the
   tree, others the star. The house is decorated with garlands, candles,
   holly, and ivy. Wreaths and mistletoe are hung on the door.

   Christmas Trees in Sweden
   Most people buy Christmas trees well before Christmas Eve, but it’s not
   common to take the tree inside and decorate it until just a few days
   before. Evergreen trees are decorated with stars, sunbursts and snowflakes
   made from straw. Other decorations include colorful wooden animals and
   straw centerpieces.

   Christmas Trees in Norway
   Norwegians often take a trip to the woods to select a Christmas tree, a
   trip that their grandfathers probably did not make. The Christmas tree was
   not introduced into Norway from Germany until the latter half of the 19th
   century; to the country districts it came even later. Many families
   decorate their trees on ‘Little Christmas Eve’—December 23. A Norwegian
   ritual known as “circling the Christmas tree” follows, where everyone
   joins hands to form a ring around the tree and then walks around it
   singing carols.

   Christmas Trees in Ukraine
   Celebrated on December 25th by Catholics and on January 7th by Orthodox
   Christians, Christmas is the most popular holiday in the Ukraine. During
   the Christmas season, which also includes New Year’s Day, people decorate
   fir trees and have parties.

   Christmas Trees in Spain
   A popular Christmas custom in Catalonia is the Caga Tió, a decorated log
   that children “feed” scraps of food during the days before Christmas. On
   Christmas, the log is covered with a blanket and the children hit it with
   a stick. Then the blanket is removed to reveal the treats like toffee and
   hazelnuts that Caga Tió has “defecated.

   Christmas Trees in Italy
   In one Italian tradition, the presepio (manger or crib) represents in
   miniature the Holy Family in the stable and is the center of Christmas for
   families. Guests kneel before it and musicians sing before it. The
   presepio figures are usually hand-carved and very detailed in features and
   dress. The scene is often set out in the shape of a triangle. It provides
   the base of a pyramid-like structure called the ceppo. This is a wooden
   frame arranged to make a pyramid several feet high. Several tiers of thin
   shelves are supported by this frame. It is entirely decorated with colored
   paper, gilt pine cones, and miniature colored pennants. Small candles are
   fastened to the tapering sides. A star or small doll is hung at the apex
   of the triangular sides. The shelves above the manger scene have small
   gifts of fruit, candy, and presents. The ceppo is likely related to older
   ‘tree of light’ traditions linked to Christmas trees in other countries.
   Some houses even have a ceppo for each child in the family.

   Christmas Trees in Germany
   Many Christmas traditions practiced around the world today started in
   Germany.

   As mentioned above, some Lutheran traditions credit Martin Luther with
   placing the first lighted candles on a Christmas tree.

   Another legend says that in the early 16th century, people in Germany
   combined two customs that had been practiced in different countries around
   the globe. The Paradise tree (a fir tree decorated with apples)
   represented the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. The Christmas
   Light, a small, pyramid-like frame, usually decorated with glass balls,
   tinsel and a candle on top, was a symbol of the birth of Christ as the
   Light of the World. Changing the tree’s apples to tinsel balls and cookies
   and combining this new tree with the light placed on top, the Germans
   created the tree that many of us know today.

   The modern Tannenbaum (Christmas trees) is traditionally decorated in
   secret with lights, tinsel and ornaments by parents and then lit and
   revealed on Christmas Eve with cookies, nuts and gifts under its branches.

   Christmas Trees in South Africa
   Christmas is a summer holiday in South Africa. Although Christmas trees
   are not common, windows are often draped with sparkling cotton wool and
   tinsel.

   Christmas Trees in Saudi Arabia
   Christian Americans, Europeans, Indians, Filipinos, and others living in
   Saudia Arabia have to celebrate Christmas privately in their homes.
   Christmas lights are generally not tolerated. Most families place their
   Christmas trees somewhere inconspicuous.

   Christmas Trees in Philippines
   Fresh pine trees are too expensive for many Filipinos, so handmade trees
   in an array of colors and sizes are often used. Star lanterns, or parol,
   appear everywhere in December. They are made from bamboo sticks, covered
   with brightly colored rice paper or cellophane, and usually feature a
   tassel on each point. There is usually one in every window, each
   representing the Star of Bethlehem.

   Christmas Trees in China
   More than 80 percent of the world’s artificial Christmas trees are made in
   China, but a much smaller portion of Chinese people celebrate Christmas as
   a religious holiday. Those who do often put up artificial trees—“trees of
   light” decorated with paper chains and lanterns.

   Christmas Trees in Japan
   For most of the Japanese who celebrate Christmas, it’s purely a secular
   holiday devoted to the love of their children. Christmas trees are
   decorated with small toys, dolls, paper ornaments, gold paper fans and
   lanterns, and wind chimes. Miniature candles are also put among the tree
   branches. One of the most popular ornaments is the origami crane. Japanese
   children have exchanged thousands of folded paper “birds of peace” with
   young people all over the world as a pledge that war must not happen
   again.

Christmas Tree Trivia and Facts

   Christmas trees have been sold commercially in the United States since
   about 1850.

   In 1979, the National Christmas Tree was not lighted except for the top
   ornament. This was done in honor of the American hostages in Iran.

   Between 1887-1933 a fishing schooner called the Christmas Ship would tie
   up at the Clark Street bridge and sell spruce and pine trees from Michigan
   to Chicagoans.

   The much-disputed title for the tallest living Christmas tree likely goes
   to an allegedly 160-foot Sitka Spruce in Ferndale, California.

   Franklin Pierce, the 14th president, is often credited with bringing the
   Christmas tree tradition to the White House in the early 1850s.

   In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge started the National Christmas Tree
   Lighting Ceremony now held every year on the White House lawn.

   Since 1966, the National Christmas Tree Association has given a Christmas
   tree to the President and first family.

   Most Christmas trees are cut weeks before they get to a retail outlet.

   In 1912, what were likely the first major community Christmas trees in the
   United States were erected in Boston, New York City and Hartford, Conn.

   Christmas trees generally take six to eight years to mature.

   Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including Hawaii and Alaska.

   Ninety-eight percent of all natural Christmas trees are grown on farms.

   More than 1,000,000 acres of land have been planted with Christmas trees.

   On average, as many as 1,500 Christmas trees are planted per acre.

   You should never burn your Christmas tree in the fireplace. It can
   contribute to creosote buildup.

   Other types of trees such as cherry and hawthorns were used as Christmas
   trees in the past.

   Thomas Edison’s assistants came up with the idea of electric lights for
   Christmas trees.

   In 1963, the National Christmas Tree was not lit until December 22nd
   because of a national 30-day period of mourning following the
   assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

   Teddy Roosevelt banned the Christmas tree from the White House, possibly
   for environmental reasons—but his young son snuck a tree into the house
   anyway.

   In the first week, a tree in your home will consume as much as three
   quarts of water per day.

   Tinsel used to be made with lead foil, but in the early 1970s the U.S.
   Food and Drug Administration convinced manufacturers to switch to plastic
   tinsel.

   The best-selling Christmas trees include the Scotch Pine, Douglas Fir,
   Fraser Fir, Balsam Fir and Blue Spruce.

HISTORY Vault: The Christmas Truce

   By December 1914, all thoughts of a quick World War I victory had faded.
   But on Christmas Eve, an astonishing event took place: Up and down the
   Western Front, Allied and German soldiers met peacefully in No Man's Land.

   Eucalyptus are one of the state’s most controversial trees. A Monterey Bay
                reserve may be a model for how to replace them.

The Elkhorn Slough Reserve is pioneering methods to restore native habitats

   Fresh tree stumps the size of dining tables line the road at the Elkhorn
   Slough Reserve, the remains of hulking eucalyptus trees that blanketed the
   ground in a thick layer of aromatic wood chips. Nothing grows in the
   wreckage, but about 40 yards away, a grove of young oak trees flourishes.

   Mary Paul, a stewardship associate at the reserve just east of Moss
   Landing at the heart of the Monterey Bay, revels in the contrast. Where
   the oaks now stand, staff removed a 13-acre grove of eucalyptus in the
   1990s and planted well over 10,000 acorns. In a few decades, the roadside
   site where eucalyptus trees were cut down this summer should match the
   restored oak savanna beside it.

   Paul hopes the restoration efforts at Elkhorn Slough will help quell
   public opposition to the removal of the eucalyptus — an invasive tree
   native to Australia that has become a California icon, and a shelter for
   migrating birds and Monarch butterflies, but must be removed because they
   crowd out native species, increase fire risk and guzzle the state’s scarce
   water.

   “It’s not just about clear-cutting all the eucalyptus within the
   watershed, or even within the reserve — it’s about creating healthy
   ecosystems and healthy balance,” Paul said. “We are trying to balance
   everything.”

   Returning eucalyptus-choked landscapes to their original glory is a long
   and arduous process. It involves coaxing the barren earth back to life and
   dealing with thousands of tons of highly flammable wood.

   Also called blue gum, eucalyptus is a fast-growing tree native to
   Tasmania, an island state south of the Australian mainland. During the
   California Gold Rush of the 1800s, they were planted for windbreaks, fuel
   and timber. But when logs came out of the mill, the lumber was of poor
   quality, and many plantations were abandoned. Thousands of acres are left
   standing today.

   At the Elkhorn Slough Reserve — home to a vast array of birds, marine
   mammals, amphibians and fish — thirsty eucalyptus trees leave the wetlands
   more vulnerable to drought and problems with water quality. To save this
   vital habitat, the reserve has made removing the trees a priority in areas
   where they are doing harm.

   But some community members have objected. In 2015, when the Elkhorn Slough
   Reserve proposed chopping down more than 1,200 trees across 50 acres by
   2025, staff received angry comments from locals, many concerned that
   important Monarch butterfly and bird habitat would disappear.

   Similar objections have erupted around felling other eucalyptus groves,
   such as the removal of 31 trees on private land around Rodeo Creek in
   Santa Cruz, which was just completed. “I had no idea how much wildlife
   lived in the eucalyptus before I moved here,” said Santa Cruz resident
   Rebecca Wyatt, who opposed the move. “In the evening time before the sun
   goes down, it’s just magical — hundreds and hundreds of birds are diving
   in and out … but now, they’re homeless. It’s just heartbreaking.”

   Monarch butterflies migrating from the Rocky Mountains to California’s
   Central Coast every winter huddle in some eucalyptus groves for warmth.
   The reserve is also an important spot along the Pacific Flyway, a major
   bird migration route, where seabirds nest in eucalyptus groves and fatten
   up in the rich estuary habitat.

   “One of the ways that we addressed that concern was pointing out that we
   were going to leave active bird nesting and butterfly nesting habitat
   intact, in a part of the reserve where there’s a huge grove of eucalyptus
   trees,” Paul said, pointing to a dense stand in the distance, beside two
   stacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant. “We’re not going to remove that at
   all, ever.”

   At another restoration site where eucalyptus trees were downed in August
   2022, native plants sprout from holes in a foot-thick layer of eucalyptus
   wood chips. The scene challenges a common belief that eucalyptus is
   “allelopathic,” meaning it releases chemicals in the soil that make it
   difficult for other plants to grow. Scientists disagree on this, however,
   and no previous studies have looked at planting in eucalyptus mulch as
   Paul is doing on the reserve’s restoration sites.

   The thick layer of mulch blocks sunlight from reaching seeds of invasive
   weeds such as Italian thistle, poison hemlock and Cape ivy that would
   otherwise quickly take over.

   “Our personal experience on the reserve was that we did not see any
   effects of allelopathy on our native plants when we planted them with wood
   chips,” Paul said.

   To encourage only native plants to grow, Paul and her team dug pits into
   the eucalyptus mulch down to the soil layer and planted species grown in
   the reserve’s native nursery, including California goldenrod and creeping
   wild rye. The reserve plans to create a pond at the end of the catchment
   for endangered California red-legged frogs and California tiger
   salamanders, which rely on bodies of freshwater in the winter to breed.

   “There was a historic stream that was present on this site that hadn’t
   really been seen very much when the eucalyptus were here,” Paul said.
   After the trees were felled, the stream resurfaced during last winter’s
   storms.

   Even after creating wood chip mulch to help with restoration projects,
   thousands of tons of wood can be left behind after a eucalyptus grove is
   cut down. So Paul and her team have experimented with turning it into
   charcoal.

   After felling their first grove in 2018, Elkhorn Slough Reserve staff and
   volunteers chopped up the trunks and larger branches and built dozens of
   4-foot diameter burn piles, lighting them from the top-down to slowly
   “pyrolize” the wood into charcoal or “biochar”  — rather than burning it
   from the bottom-up into ash, which would release much more carbon into the
   air. They then buried some of the charcoal as part of an effort to restore
   a salt marsh, locking up the carbon the eucalyptus trees had sucked from
   the air over their lifetime.

   But this manual approach to making charcoal proved impractical. “That was
   such a labor-intensive process that we ended up stopping because we just
   didn’t have the capacity to do it anymore,” Paul said.

   The Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with the reserve,
   decided to automate the process after chopping down 8,000 tons of
   eucalyptus on 7 acres in 2021. Land acquisitions coordinator Kevin
   Contreras persuaded a contractor, Ventana Forestry, to buy a $500,000
   carbonator — a huge kiln the size of a shipping container that heats wood
   at temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Fahrenheit. After the carbonator
   went to work, the foundation was left with 215 tons of charcoal and a tiny
   pile of ash.

   This winter, Contreras is partnering with Arun Jani, assistant professor
   of crop management at CSU Monterey Bay, and Javier Zamora, an organic
   farmer at Triple M Ranch, to study whether charcoal mixed with compost
   will enhance crop growth. Since charcoal is porous and absorbent, it’s
   expected to hold moisture and create habitat for microbes in the soil that
   help plants grow.

   If the experiment is a success, selling charcoal to farmers could provide
   a stream of income to help offset the cost of eucalyptus removal. The
   Elkhorn Slough Foundation wants to remove another 100 acres of eucalyptus
   on its land, an undertaking Contreras says will cost upwards of $2
   million.

   “If we’re going to tackle eucalyptus on a statewide basis, we need to be
   able to drive the cost of these projects down,” he said.

   Some important tree species native to the northwestern states in the U.S.
   are no longer growing well because of climate change.

   As conditions change in states such as Washington, Oregon and California,
   trees such as the Douglas fir, Western red cedar, giant sequoia and
   redwood may need to move -- with the help of humans.

   Some of the trees do not do well when temperatures rise. Others suffer
   during times of drought. The goal is to move the trees to areas where the
   climate might more suitable.

   Forest scientists are generally in favor of moving the trees so they do
   not die out. However, not all of the scientists agree on the best way to
   do it.

   There are three ways to move trees: assisted population migration,
   assisted species migration and range expansion.

   Canyon Nation Park Fire Service, looks for an opening in the burned-out
   sequoias from the Redwood Mountain Grove. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian, File)

   sequoias from the Redwood Mountain Grove. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian, File)

   Assisted population migration involves scientists moving a tree’s seeds
   within its current growing range. Assisted species migration involves
   scientists moving a species far from its existing area. In this case, that
   would include moving redwoods and sequoias from California to Washington.

   The third way, range expansion, moves trees just outside their current
   growing range. Each way has different results for the trees and other
   animals and insects that depend on the trees.

   Michael Case is a forest ecologist at the Nature Conservancy in Virginia.
   He said “there is a huge difference” among the different migration
   methods.

   He said the risk of failure increases “whenever you plant something in an
   area where it is not locally found.” He said the risk is not only to the
   trees. There is also the risk of causing problems in the ecosystem.

   Case is working on an assisted population migration program with Douglas
   fir and Western hemlock trees. He is testing whether the trees, originally
   from drier parts of the northwest, can do well in western Washington where
   there is a drought. His organization believes that assisted population
   migration has fewer risks.

   The U.S. Forest Service also takes part in assisted population migration
   programs. Dr. David Lytle is the agency’s deputy chief for research and
   development. He said the agency is “very very cautious” about moving
   plants outside of their “historic range.”

   Douglas Tallamy is a professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the
   University of Delaware. He said one worry about species migration is that
   local caterpillars might not eat the leaves of trees that are new to the
   area. The caterpillars serve as food for birds and other animals, so they
   must have a good food source.

   Although the concerns are documented, the city of Portland, Oregon, is
   working on a species migration project for 11 tree species. The project
   includes three oak trees: California black oak, canyon live oak and
   interior live oak. Tallamy said oak trees are among the most important in
   North America. “When you move them out of range,” he said, “the things
   that are adapted to eating them no longer have access to them.”

   The city responded to questions from the Associated Press, and said it is
   using guidelines “from universities, state and federal sources” and more,
   in its project.

   Another group working on species migration projects in the northwest is
   called PropagationNation. To propagate means to produce a new plant
   through the use of seeds or parts of another plant.

   That organization is planting non-local trees around the Seattle,
   Washington area in hopes that they will start growing in places where
   Western red cedar, Western hemlock and big leaf maple are having trouble.

   David Milarch is the leader of a group in Michigan that supports keeping
   old trees alive. It is called Archangel Ancient Tree Archive. Milarch said
   the hope is to permit redwoods and sequoias to grow in areas to the north.
   The hope is not to replace native trees.

   He said his group hopes the trees “will still be here in 100 to 200 years
   and not join the list of trees that are going extinct.”

   The organizations that are not practicing widely accepted methods for
   moving species feel like the risks are worth it.

   But Robert Slesak is not sure about either practice. He oversees
   population migration sites run by the U.S. Forest Service in California,
   Oregon and Washington.

   He said he has concerns about assisted species migrations and assisted
   population migrations that lack experimental rigor. Rigor describes an
   activity that has been tested with high standards.

   He said all of the ideas about how to move trees should follow experiments
   that have already produced strong results.

   “Everyone knows we need to do some kind of action related to climate, but
   there’s a real risk of making it worse.”

   (angiosperm) tree [IMG]European larch (Larix decidua), a coniferous tree
   which is also deciduous

   In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
   usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of
   a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
   plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
   wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
   also trees.

   Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety
   of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
   way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of
   tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are
   gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching
   several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million
   years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees
   in the world.

   A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground
   by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and
   vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
   For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a
   protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out
   widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients
   from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and
   shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
   convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the
   tree's growth and development.

   Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but
   some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
   Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce
   spores instead.

   Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the
   climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large
   quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat
   for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the
   most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter,
   timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food
   as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests are
   shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available
   for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have
   always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play
   a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Definition

   [IMG]Diagram of secondary growth in a eudicot or coniferous tree showing
   idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added
   in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots.

   Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally
   recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in
   common language.^[1]^[2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with
   the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the
   photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.^[3]
   Trees are also typically defined by height,^[4] with smaller plants from
   0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,^[5] so the minimum
   height of a tree is only loosely defined.^[4] Large herbaceous plants such
   as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.^[2]^[6]

   A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk
   formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by
   growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the
   growing tip.^[4]^[7] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as
   palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their
   height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered
   trees under a slightly looser definition;^[8] while the Joshua tree,
   bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood
   with growth rings,^[9]^[10] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying
   cells formed by primary growth.^[11] Tree species in the genus Dracaena,
   despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem
   in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in
   dicotyledonous trees.^[12]

   Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for
   instance, as those plants which yield lumber.^[13]

Overview

   "Saplings" redirects here. For the novel, see Saplings (novel). For the
   film, see The Saplings. For the episode, see Saplings (Weeds).

   The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different
   groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for
   sunlight.^[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,^[15] some reaching
   several thousand years old.^[16] Several trees are among the oldest
   organisms now living.^[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker
   stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and
   durability, allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to
   spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar
   growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;^[5]
   but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,^[18]
   made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under
   harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
   The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in
   response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example
   of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the
   number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living
   plant species.^[19]^[20] The greatest number of these grow in tropical
   regions; many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by
   botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.^[21]

   [IMG]Tall herbaceous monocotyledonous plants such as banana lack secondary
   growth, but are trees under the broadest definition.

   The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods. Of the rest,
   many are gymnosperms or softwood trees;^[22] these include conifers,
   cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales, which produce seeds which are not
   enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many
   have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.^[23] Most angiosperm trees
   are eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain
   two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old
   lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots;
   these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,^[24] while trees
   such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

   Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this
   supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows
   water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant,
   and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees,
   as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the
   xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the
   leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.^[25] The
   three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are
   integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living
   cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium
   allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
   Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also
   have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives
   rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and
   reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork
   are forms of secondary growth.^[26]

   Trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green
   throughout the year,^[27] or deciduous, shedding their leaves at the end
   of the growing season and then having a dormant period without
   foliage.^[28] Most conifers are evergreens, but larches (Larix and
   Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some
   species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small
   leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.^[5] The crown is
   the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,^[29] while
   the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is
   known as the canopy.^[30] A sapling is a young tree.^[31]

   Many tall palms are herbaceous^[32] monocots, which do not undergo
   secondary growth and never produce wood.^[9]^[10] In many tall palms, the
   terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have
   unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree
   ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20
   metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which
   grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.^[33]

Distribution

   Further information: Forest
   [IMG]The Daintree Rainforest

   The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04
   trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics,
   0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the
   coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than
   previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over
   400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least
   because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate
   suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5
   billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human
   agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by
   46%.^[34]^[35]^[36]^[37] There are approximately 64,100 known tree species
   in the world. With 43% of all tree species, South America has the highest
   biodiversity, followed by Eurasia (22%), Africa (16%), North America
   (15%), and Oceania (11%).^[38]

   In suitable environments, such as the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland,
   or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand,
   forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end of
   a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by
   taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a
   forest canopy.^[39]^[40]

   [IMG]Conifers in the Swabian alps

   In cool temperate regions, conifers often predominate; a widely
   distributed climax community in the far north of the northern hemisphere
   is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal
   forest).^[41]^[42] Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of
   the world's forest cover.^[43] The long cold winter of the far north is
   unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short
   summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is
   very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on
   the forest floor, although fungi may abound.^[44] Similar woodland is
   found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be
   lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.^[45]

   Where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate
   regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like
   oak, beech, birch and maple is found.^[46] Temperate forest is also found
   in the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia
   temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia
   woodland.^[47]

   In tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier
   part of the year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest,
   different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them
   being deciduous.^[48] In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and
   insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed,
   and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and
   scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.^[49]

Parts and function

  Roots

   [IMG]A young red pine (Pinus resinosa) with spread of roots visible, as a
   result of soil erosion
   Main article: Root

   The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and
   nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for
   reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.
   The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge
   from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a
   taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots
   branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper
   layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and
   the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are
   single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil
   particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in
   solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such
   as mangroves and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in
   permanently waterlogged soil.^[50]

   In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are
   known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree
   roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish
   in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and
   associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus
   from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of
   photosynthesis from the tree.^[51] The hyphae of the fungus can link
   different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and
   signals from one place to another.^[52] The fungus promotes growth of the
   roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can
   also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate
   heavy metals within its tissues.^[53] Fossil evidence shows that roots
   have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic,
   four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised
   dry land.^[54]

   [IMG]Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)

   Some trees such as Alder (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship
   with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from
   the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules
   on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree
   to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to
   thrive.^[55] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule
   formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.^[56]

   It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their
   root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the
   inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal
   tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by
   injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking
   for its presence in neighbouring trees.^[57]

   The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree
   species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial
   roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of
   the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical
   stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that
   loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the
   mud.^[58] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.^[59] Many
   large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the
   trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide
   stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in
   tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the
   surface.^[60]

   Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in
   order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of
   excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are
   present, among others, in black mangrove and pond cypress.^[58]

  Trunk

   [IMG]Northern beech (Fagus sylvatica) trunk in autumn
   Main article: Trunk (botany)

   The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground,
   enabling the tree to overtop other plants and outcompete them for
   light.^[61] It also transports water and nutrients from the roots to the
   aerial parts of the tree, and distributes the food produced by the leaves
   to all other parts, including the roots.^[62]

   In the case of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the
   trunk is the bark, mostly composed of dead cells of phellem (cork).^[63]
   It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It
   protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire.
   It is perforated by a large number of fine breathing pores called
   lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by
   a living layer of cells called the cork cambium or phellogen.^[63] The
   London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large
   flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off
   in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in
   circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In
   some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin
   which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is
   a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis)
   contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.^[62] Large
   tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales,
   Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos
   have different structures and outer coverings.^[64]

   [IMG]A section of yew (Taxus baccata) showing 27 annual growth rings, pale
   sapwood and dark heartwood

   Although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked
   by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and
   the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery
   of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the
   tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried
   from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the
   growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards
   and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of
   nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were
   killed by this disease.^[65]

   The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in
   the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to
   other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some
   of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by
   parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for
   strengthening the tissue.^[66] Inside the phloem is a layer of
   undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer.
   The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside
   and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.^[67]

   The newly created xylem is the sapwood. It is composed of water-conducting
   cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in
   colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts
   of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively
   converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The
   conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species. Heartwood
   is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core
   of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the
   xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin,
   a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a
   horizontal core will show concentric circles of lighter or darker wood –
   tree rings.^[68] These rings are the annual growth rings^[69]^[70] There
   may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are
   vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the
   wood.^[68] Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright
   for many years.^[71]

  Buds and growth

   Main article: Bud
   [IMG]Dormant Magnolia bud

   Trees do not usually grow continuously throughout the year but mostly have
   spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This pattern of
   growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when
   conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive
   period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active
   growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the
   tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and
   enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is
   a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand
   when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the
   leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the
   eucalyptus, have "naked buds" with no protective scales and some conifers,
   such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets
   of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.^[72]

   When growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and
   the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts
   again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the
   process. These leave behind scars on the surface of the twig. The whole
   year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is
   unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms)
   have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.^[72] In some
   tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas
   growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss
   of early foliage to insect predators.^[73]

   Primary growth is the elongation of the stems and roots. Secondary growth
   consists of a progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as
   the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium
   layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.^[74]
   Eventually the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no
   taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.^[75]

  Leaves

   Main article: Leaf

   Leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on
   the tree in such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without
   shading each other.^[76] They are an important investment by the tree and
   may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to
   discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes
   and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and
   predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or
   entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The
   needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to
   those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments
   where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water
   availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher
   altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such
   as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling
   them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions
   deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get
   shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make
   new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the
   blades become apparent.^[76] Synthesis in the leaf of a plant hormone
   called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the
   petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats
   to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their
   leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be
   replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other
   tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves
   annually, such as at the start of the dry season.^[77] Many deciduous
   trees flower before the new leaves emerge.^[78] A few trees do not have
   true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance
   such as Phylloclades – modified stem structures^[79] – as seen in the
   genus Phyllocladus.^[80]

  Reproduction

   Further information: Plant reproduction, Pollination, and Seed dispersal

   Trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects. Many
   angiosperm trees are insect pollinated. Wind pollination may take
   advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground.^[81] Trees use a
   variety of methods of seed dispersal. Some rely on wind, with winged or
   plumed seeds. Others rely on animals, for example with edible fruits.
   Others again eject their seeds (ballistic dispersal), or use gravity so
   that seeds fall and sometimes roll.^[82]

  Seeds

   Main article: Seed

   Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary
   greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but
   the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest
   tree seeds.^[83] The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the
   many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their
   offspring.

   [IMG]Wind dispersed seed of elm (Ulmus), ash (Fraxinus) and maple (Acer)

   For a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light. If seeds
   only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated
   saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from
   flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to
   aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with
   blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The
   kapok tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.^[84]

   The seeds of conifers, the largest group of gymnosperms, are enclosed in a
   cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be
   blown considerable distances once free from the cone.^[85] Sometimes the
   seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate
   it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and
   also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing
   vegetation.^[86] Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia
   cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure
   to high temperatures.^[87]

   The flame tree Delonix regia does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds
   through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart
   explosively on drying.^[84] The miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees
   produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the
   seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some
   species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start
   germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.^[88]^[89] These
   float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and
   successfully take root.^[84]

   [IMG]Cracked thorny skin of a Aesculus tree seed

   Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy receptacles
   and smaller fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue;
   animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the
   seeds, or swallow them so they pass through the gut to be deposited in the
   animal's droppings well away from the parent tree. The germination of some
   seeds is improved when they are processed in this way.^[90] Nuts may be
   gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately
   consumed.^[91] Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing
   softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring.^[92]
   Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears
   may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.^[93]

   The single extant species of Ginkgophyta (Ginkgo biloba) has fleshy seeds
   produced at the ends of short branches on female trees,^[94] and Gnetum, a
   tropical and subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of
   a shoot axis.^[95]

Evolutionary history

   [IMG]Lepidodendron, an extinct lycophyte tree [IMG]Palms and cycads as
   they might have appeared in the middle Tertiary
   Further information: Evolutionary history of plants

   The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew
   in forests in the Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been
   Wattieza, fossils of which have been found in New York state in 2007
   dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to
   this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.^[96] Both of
   these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be
   links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic
   period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and
   these may have appeared as a result of a whole genome duplication event
   which took place about 319 million years ago.^[97] Ginkgophyta was once a
   widespread diverse group^[98] of which the only survivor is the maidenhair
   tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is
   virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic
   deposits.^[99]

   During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the conifers flourished
   and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats.
   Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the
   Cretaceous period. These began to displace the conifers during the
   Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the
   globe.^[100] When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first
   of four glacial periods occurred, the forests retreated as the ice
   advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been
   covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next glacial
   period.^[100]

Ecology

   Further information: Forest

   Trees are an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem,^[101] providing
   essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of
   organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts,
   orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from
   branches;^[102] these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi
   provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including
   animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the
   ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth,
   leaf litter, and decaying wood that provide other habitat.^[103]^[104]
   Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help
   prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the
   maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.^[105]

   Many species of tree support their own specialised invertebrates. In their
   natural habitats, 284 different species of insect have been found on the
   English oak (Quercus robur)^[106] and 306 species of invertebrate on the
   Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua).^[107] Non-native tree species provide
   a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the
   sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has
   few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports a wide range
   of lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.^[108] Trees differ
   ecologically in the ease with which they can be found by herbivores. Tree
   apparency varies with a tree's size and semiochemical content, and with
   the extent to which it is concealed by nonhost neighbours from its insect
   pests.^[109]

   In ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the
   habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of
   tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and
   creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus
   mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations.^[110]
   Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging
   effects of cyclones and tsunamis.^[111]

Uses

  Food

   Further information: nut (fruit) and fruit

   Trees are the source of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits.
   Apples, pears, plums, cherries and citrus are all grown commercially in
   temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the
   tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and
   olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to
   make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica
   and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many
   rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for
   consumption.^[112] Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be
   described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These
   include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa),
   pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus
   dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many
   others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein,
   vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre.^[113] A variety of nut
   oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut,
   pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but
   they tend to spoil quickly.^[114]

   [IMG]Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) tapped to collect sap for maple syrup

   In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of sap at the end of the
   winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of
   the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a
   sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining
   10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is
   harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the
   liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse
   where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. Similarly in
   northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula
   pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented
   into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula
   lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap
   is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one
   litre of birch syrup.^[115]

   Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include cinnamon, made
   from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice,
   the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a
   seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and
   cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium
   aromaticum).^[116]

   Many trees have flowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees. The
   production of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the
   developing world where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using
   traditional methods.^[117] The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to
   make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be
   candied.^[118] Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark
   from the roots of the sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).

   The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some
   can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes
   them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those
   of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (in Thai food)^[119] and Ailanthus (in
   Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus
   nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used
   for flavouring food.^[116] Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a
   small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to
   make picking the leaves easier.^[120]

   Wood smoke can be used to preserve food. In the hot smoking process the
   food is exposed to smoke and heat in a controlled environment. The food is
   ready to eat when the process is complete, having been tenderised and
   flavoured by the smoke it has absorbed. In the cold process, the
   temperature is not allowed to rise above 100 °F (38 °C). The flavour of
   the food is enhanced but raw food requires further cooking. If it is to be
   preserved, meat should be cured before cold smoking.^[121]

  Fuel

   Main article: Wood fuel
   [IMG]Selling firewood at a market

   Wood has traditionally been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In
   less developed nations it may be the only fuel available and collecting
   firewood is often a time-consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel
   further and further afield in the search for fuel.^[122] It is often
   burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other
   fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity.
   Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such
   as wood pellets are available to burn.^[123]

   Charcoal can be made by slow pyrolysis of wood by heating it in the
   absence of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are
   burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them
   into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in
   barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.^[124]

  Timber

   Main articles: Wood and Timber
   [IMG]Roof trusses made from softwood

   Timber, "trees that are grown in order to produce wood"^[125] is cut into
   lumber (sawn wood) for use in construction. Wood has been an important,
   easily available material for construction since humans started building
   shelters. Engineered wood products are available which bind the particles,
   fibres or veneers of wood together with adhesives to form composite
   materials. Plastics have taken over from wood for some traditional
   uses.^[126]

   Wood is used in the construction of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles,
   poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers,
   fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets.
   In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses,
   roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor
   boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.^[127]

   [IMG]Trees in art: Weeping Willow, Claude Monet, 1918

   Wood is used to construct carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and
   in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes,
   ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs,
   brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs,
   wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs,
   oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.^[127]

   Wood is pulped for paper and used in the manufacture of cardboard and made
   into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard,
   hardboard, chipboard and plywood.^[127] The wood of conifers is known as
   softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.^[128]

  Art

   Besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have been used to
   create art. Living trees have been used in bonsai and in tree shaping, and
   both living and dead specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic
   shapes.^[129]

    Bonsai

   [IMG]Informal upright style of bonsai on a juniper tree
   Main article: Bonsai

   Bonsai (盆栽, lit. "Tray planting")^[130] is the practice of hòn non bộ
   originated in China and spread to Japan more than a thousand years ago,
   there are similar practices in other cultures like the living miniature
   landscapes of Vietnam hòn non bộ. The word bonsai is often used in English
   as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.^[131]

   The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and
   the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).^[132]
   Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or
   more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting,
   seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development.
   Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or
   shrub species^[133] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to
   remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some
   species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics,
   such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the
   compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even
   be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or
   hornbeam.^[134]

    Tree shaping

   Main article: Tree shaping
   [IMG]People trees, by Pooktre

   Tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees and other woody
   plants into man made shapes for art and useful structures. There are a few
   different methods^[135] of shaping a tree. There is a gradual method and
   there is an instant method. The gradual method slowly guides the growing
   tip along predetermined pathways over time whereas the instant method
   bends and weaves saplings 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft) long into a shape that
   becomes more rigid as they thicken up.^[136] Most artists use grafting of
   living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or functional structures and
   there are plans to grow "living houses" with the branches of trees
   knitting together to give a solid, weatherproof exterior combined with an
   interior application of straw and clay to provide a stucco-like inner
   surface.^[136]

   Tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the
   oldest known examples being the living root bridges built and maintained
   by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using the roots of the rubber tree
   (Ficus elastica).^[137]^[138]

  Bark

   [IMG]Recently stripped cork oak (Quercus suber)
   Further information: Bark (botany)

   Cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It
   is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an
   environmentally sustainable industry.^[139] More than half the world's
   cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine
   bottles.^[140] Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls,
   footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind
   instruments.^[140]

   The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe
   for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been
   used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after
   various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats
   containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the
   hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to
   bacterial attack.^[141]

   At least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of
   trees.^[142] Quinine originates from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was
   for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.^[143]
   Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the
   bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects.^[144] The
   anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in
   the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia).^[145] Other tree based
   drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the
   cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and
   the downy birch (Betula pubescens).^[142]

   The papery bark of the white birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used
   extensively by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes
   were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and
   fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges.^[146] Nowadays,
   bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and
   as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free
   compost.^[147]

  Ornamental trees

   Main article: Ornamental trees

   Trees create a visual impact in the same way as do other landscape
   features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden.
   They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers,
   fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a
   landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings
   of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living
   things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to
   year.^[148]

   Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as
   street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through
   evapotranspiration, absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept
   rainfall, and reduce the risk of flooding. Scientific studies show that
   street trees help cities be more sustainable, and improve the physical and
   mental wellbeing of the citizens.^[149] It has been shown that they are
   beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing
   stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.^[150] In
   London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street
   trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to
   one tree for every resident.^[151]

  Other uses

   [IMG]Latex collecting from a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)
   Further information: Resin, Latex, and Camphor

   Latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against
   herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the
   latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea
   brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the
   waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for
   which synthetic materials have proved less durable.^[152] The latex exuded
   by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is
   similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the "getah perca" tree
   Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea
   cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely
   been replaced by synthetic materials.^[153]

   Resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a
   viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile terpenes and is produced mostly
   by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings
   and in ten-pin bowling balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and
   the remaining product is called "rosin" and is used by stringed
   instrumentalists on their bows. Some resins contain essential oils and are
   used in incense and aromatherapy. Fossilised resin is known as amber and
   was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more
   recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or
   spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.^[154]

   The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil^[116] and
   the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus
   oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.^[155]

Threats

  Individual trees

   Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe
   storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the
   presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and
   reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce
   building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water
   stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and
   insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating
   trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and
   death.^[156]

  Conservation

   About a third of all tree species, some twenty thousand, are included in
   the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Of those, over eight thousand are
   globally threatened, including at least 1400 which are classed as
   "critically endangered".^[157]

Mythology

   Main article: Trees in mythology
   [IMG]Yggdrasil, the World Ash of Norse mythology

   Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts,
   certain trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special
   significance^[158] as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental
   objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often
   linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as
   oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs who
   inhabited trees.

   The Oubangui people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As
   the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive,
   the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time
   for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the
   individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.^[159]

   Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended
   towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as
   a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens.
   In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and
   branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it.^[160] In
   India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that
   emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be
   worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the
   devout who tie threads round the trunk.^[161] Democracy started in North
   America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy,
   inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their
   weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus
   strobus).^[162] In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and
   the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of
   Eden.^[163]

   Sacred groves exist in China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They are places
   where the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred
   or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural
   penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the
   felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves may be
   the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater
   than the surrounding area.^[164] Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as
   Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or
   Kadambariyamman, associated with the cadamba tree, were seen as
   manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in
   abundance.^[165]

Superlative trees

   [IMG]The General Sherman Tree, thought to be the world's largest by volume
   Main article: List of superlative trees

   Trees have a theoretical maximum height of 130 m (430 ft),^[166] but the
   tallest known specimen on earth is believed to be a coast redwood (Sequoia
   sempervirens) at Redwood National Park, California. It has been named
   Hyperion and is 115.85 m (380.1 ft) tall.^[167] In 2006, it was reported
   to be 379.1 ft (115.5 m) tall.^[168] The tallest known broad-leaved tree
   is a mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) growing in Tasmania with a height
   of 99.8 m (327 ft).^[169]

   The largest tree by volume is believed to be a giant sequoia
   (Sequoiadendron giganteum) known as the General Sherman Tree in the
   Sequoia National Park in Tulare County, California. Only the trunk is used
   in the calculation and the volume is estimated to be 1,487 m^3
   (52,500 cu ft).^[170]

   The oldest living tree with a verified age is also in California. It is a
   Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) growing in the White
   Mountains. It has been dated by drilling a core sample and counting the
   annual rings. It is estimated to currently be 5,078 years old.^[a]^[171]

   A little farther south, at Santa Maria del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the
   tree with the broadest trunk. It is a Montezuma cypress (Taxodium
   mucronatum) known as Árbol del Tule and its diameter at breast height is
   11.62 m (38.1 ft) giving it a girth of 36.2 m (119 ft). The tree's trunk
   is far from round and the exact dimensions may be misleading as the
   circumference includes much empty space between the large buttress
   roots.^[172]

       The diversity of tree species in the boreal forest is quite low, with
       black spruce (Picea mariana), larch or tamarack (Larix laricina), and
       white spruce (P. glauca) the most common species. The former two
       species generally occupy wet sites with poorly drained mineral or
       organic soils, while white spruce is the climatic climax species on
       sites that are drier and higher in nutrient content. Balsam fir (Abies
       balsamea) is a dominant tree species in the eastern half of the biome.

               Want To Cool Down Honolulu? Plant A Lot More Trees

   There are a multitude of “heat islands” across Oahu that harm humans and
   increase economic costs.

   There are a multitude of “heat islands” across Oahu that harm humans and
   increase economic costs.

   Al Gore once said, “The best available technology for pulling carbon
   dioxide from the air is something called a tree.”

   [IMG][IMG]

   True, Mr. Gore. Trees provide cooling at a global scale by sequestering
   carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming.
   Trees are also the smartest available technology at the local level for
   cooling our homes, schools, and parks through evaporation and shading.

   Yet Honolulu is losing trees. Why? It’s a loss of a tree here, a tree
   there. In short, lots of little things that collectively add up to a big
   problem. 

   This is what the youth, in a Trees for Honolulu’s Future initiative called
   “Heat Island Investigators,” discovered over the past year. Heat islands
   are locales often associated with urban development that experience higher
   temperatures than surrounding areas.

   Honolulu has many such locations where buildings and roads absorb and
   reemit the sun’s heat. Urban areas, where human-built infrastructure like
   this is concentrated and greenery is limited, become “islands” of higher
   temperatures relative to outlying areas.

   Why are trees so good at mitigating heat islands?

     * Trees act like pumps as roots gather water from the soil and release
       it to the atmosphere where it evaporates, cooling the air in a process
       called transpiration.
     * Trees act like umbrellas as leaves in the canopy intercept and reflect
       solar radiation keeping surfaces below cooler because they are
       shielded from direct sun.

   Groups of trees are most impactful. Isolated trees provide some, but
   limited cooling as wind passes warmer air from adjacent areas beneath the
   canopy in a process called advection. Quite simply, more trees equals more
   cooling.

   The Heat Island Investigators initiative included two sites, both of which
   are underserved areas that are heat islands: Aiea Intermediate School and
   Makalapa Neighborhood Park (via Parents and Children Together program at
   Puuwai Momi public housing).

Taking The Temperature

   At each site student scientists developed maps of current conditions,
   including measuring and plotting trees and temperatures, and identified
   solutions by applying experiential place-based learning using an array of
   sophisticated equipment and a rigorous testing regime.

   Temperature, light, and canopy conditions were measured under and adjacent
   to a number of trees at several local parks. Measurements in the shade and
   sun were taken simultaneously at cardinal directions to account for
   differences in canopy density as well as time of day and year.

   Measurements of temperature and light from canopy shade and in the
   adjacent sunlight show the difference that shade can make. A partial gap
   in the canopy shows intermediate temperature and brightness. Sunlight
   explains 99% difference in temperature. (Courtesy Daniel Dinell)

   Now here’s where findings got interesting. Measurements of surface
   temperature and light associated with sun and shade under and around a
   Monkeypod tree illustrate the relationship of sun exposure to surface
   temperature. Sensors in the sun were about 12 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
   and it was about 20 times brighter whereas under a partial gap in the
   canopy light and temperature were intermediate.

   It’s no big surprise that shaded surface temperatures were cooler, yet the
   ambient air temperature, measured in a solar radiation shield, showed only
   a 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit difference between sun and shade.

   The conclusion? Air isn’t necessarily cooler in the shade, but surfaces
   that are in the shade stay cooler.

   Even without trees, in areas getting the same amount of solar radiation,
   such as a grassy field versus on an outdoor basketball court, it will feel
   cooler on the grass. There are other factors such as wind and humidity as
   well — the takeaway here is air temperature isn’t the only factor in how
   hot, or cool, one feels.

   It’s not just the youth who have figured this out. The City and County of
   Honolulu Climate Change Commission has identified heat impact as both a
   stress through urban heat islands and as a shock through heat waves.

   Honolulu has a multitude of heat islands that cause serious human impacts
   such as heat-related mortality and morbidity, as well as economic costs
   such as increased peak electricity demand. Trees aren’t the only answer to
   this situation, but they sure are a smart, cost-effective, response.

   Fortunately, change at Makalapa Neighborhood Park, featured in a May 2023
   Civil Beat story, is underway. In September 2023, after Noah Kindaro, a
   10-year-old youth, testified at the Honolulu City Council Committee on
   Parks, the park’s lights were turned on the next evening.

   A Friends of Makalapa Park community group is in the process of being
   established. And the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation is
   exploring planting shade trees. Read on to discover why trees are an
   excellent way to help this, and other areas of Honolulu, reduce how hot it
   feels.

How To Help

   How can you make a difference in reducing the urban heat island effect?

   Plant a tree in your own yard. Myriad resources for advice abound,
   including at TreesForHonolululu.org, local nurseries, and certified
   arborists to help you select the right tree in the right place and provide
   the right care.

   Volunteer! Numerous organizations actively plant and maintain trees. Where
   to start? The Events listing at TreesForHonolululu.org is a good place.

   Request a street tree. Call the City’s Division of Urban Forestry at (808)
   971-7151 or email DUF@honolulu.gov. Keep in mind that not all requests
   will be approved as the location must meet various standards, however,
   staff will review and consider your request. If approved, the city will
   plant and prune the tree, but you will need to commit to watering the
   trees to help get it established.

   Advocate for urban trees as if your life depends on it, because it does.

   See Haleiwa_Dad below...Lollipopped trees seem to be a spreading cancer.
   It takes work to maintain landscaped parks and parking lots, etc. "Too
   much humbug" to rake leaves and seedpods from all over.Root of problem
   (pun intended) is landscape designers seem clueless about what to plant
   where. That is tied to the fact that nurseries seem not to be able to
   invest in longterm housing of appropriate trees to get them up to size.
   Then, when a contract is had to plant parking medians, designers scramble
   and end up with Enny Kine Stuffs. Lots of beautiful quick-growing kou with
   their abundant deadly spherical seed pods, kamani that grow way too big,
   loulu from Fiji rather than one of our HawaiÊ»i ones, and the usual
   quick-turnover natives: hibiscuses , pÅhinahina, Ê»Äkia, Ê»ukiÊ»uki,
   etc. Often overlooked are Ê»aÊ»aliÊ»i, pili, wiliwili, alaheÊ»e, lama, and
   of course our beloved Ê»ÅhiÊ»a. Why? No moÊ». No can get. Too expensive.
   Just think: If Ê»ÅhiÊ»a were planted all over in new and old
   developments, along with their friends to form kÄ«puka, weÊ»d perhaps
   ensure its survival against ROD. But to do that, we need to invest in
   their cultivation. Same too with loulu. And, educate everyone.

   Saw some interesting studies out of warming European cities; they studied
   foot traffic in downtowns where large sail-like canopies had been
   installed over the streets and groups of trees were planted in frequent
   pocket parks. Surface heat was greatly reduced in the resulting shade and
   shoppers returned to the community because they werenât broiling in sun.
   The shade was available immediately and maintenance costs minimal.

   There is zero enforcement of building codes that require trees and shrubs
   planted in new or expanded parking lots and landscaped street-facing
   planters. Typically the construction contractor installs per plans, then
   the owners/maintainers let 'em die, improperly prune by stunting and
   'lollypop' rounding over, or actually remove and not replace. I've seen a
   maintenance guy torture trees, at a gas station along Kam Hwy, by
   literally plucking off the leaves, from a ladder, repeatedly, until it
   died. No one ever comes back and makes 'em replant the trees. Better
   solution would be groups of trees or a large tree, allowed to grow large,
   on a corner or edge and not try to spot lollypop trees every so many
   stalls like you see. The key is actual shaded areas on the parking lot,
   not how many shadeless lolly pops you have.

  Convicted tree thief’s ‘right to survive’ trumps Iowa law, his lawyer argues

        By: Jared Strong - January 2, 2024 6:56 pm

   trees from state land. DNR officials said his property, shown here, had

   A northwest Iowa man had the right to cut down and take trees from a
   public wildlife management area because he needed the wood for shelter and
   heat, his attorney argues.

   That argument is part of Jason Lavant Ferguson’s repeated efforts to
   overrule a jury’s unanimous decision in November that found him guilty of
   felony theft and 50 timber violations.

   [IMG] Jason Levant Ferguson, 41, of Rolfe (Booking photo courtesy of
   Pocahontas County jail)

   The 41-year-old rural Rolfe man was accused of taking more than 100 trees
   from the Stoddard Wildlife Management Area in Pocahontas County without
   permission, including a slow-growing bur oak that was about six feet in
   diameter at its base.

   He is set to be sentenced Jan. 26 and faces up to five years in prison for
   the theft charge and one year apiece for each of the timber violations.

   A district court judge last month rejected Ferguson’s claims that an
   800-year-old English charter empowers him to take trees from public land
   and that he deserves a new trial. Subsequently, his attorney expanded on
   that claim and filed a motion in arrest of judgment, which asks a judge
   not to impose the jury’s verdict because it was made in error.

   “The defendant’s activities can be summarized as cutting wood to rebuild
   his home and heat his home so he didn’t die from hypothermia,” wrote
   Ferguson’s attorney, Kevin Fors, of Harcourt. “These are the very acts
   protected by the (Charter of the Forest) when given in 1215 and reaffirmed
   in the third version released in 1217 and ratified by later kings.”

   Ferguson told state conservation officers that he had planned to use some
   of the timber to build a house. In seeking a new trial, Ferguson had
   argued that the English charter’s provisions — which established rights of
   commoners to use public lands — are part of the United States’ unwritten
   “common law” that the country retained when it broke from England.

   But District Court Judge Derek Johnson decided last month that the charter
   applies to the forests of England, not the United States.

   Nevertheless, Ferguson’s attorney continues to insist that Americans have
   a fundamental right to harvest lumber and firewood from public land. He
   pointed to federal provisions that allow people to take trees from
   national parks under certain circumstances.

   “I am arguing in this time and in this place it is morally wrong and
   legally wrong to prosecute an individual for subsisting on forest products
   owned by the sovereign,” Fors wrote in his recent motion. “As a human
   right you have a right to survive even if it doesn’t conform to state
   imposed restrictions.”

   Ferguson was successful last year in defending himself against numerous
   felony drug and weapons charges that stemmed from the tree theft
   investigation. The judge decided that search warrants that uncovered
   evidence of marijuana and methamphetamine production at Ferguson’s
   property were improperly approved, and that the evidence could not be used
   to prosecute Ferguson.

   It’s unclear when the judge will rule on Fors’ recent arrested-judgment
   motion.

 As tree species face decline, ‘assisted migration’ gains popularity in Pacific
                                   Northwest

   By NATHAN GILLES, Columbia Insight
   PORTLAND, Oregon Jan. 2, 2024 2 p.m.

‘Assisted migration’ means humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could migrate on
their own

   Douglas fir trees that died as a result of insect damage following heat
   stress are visible in the Willamette National Forest, Ore., Friday, Oct.
   27, 2023. As native trees in the Pacific Northwest die off due to climate
   change, the U.S. Forest Service and others are turning to a strategy
   called "assisted migration."

   As native trees in the Pacific Northwest die off due to climate changes,
   the U.S. Forest Service in Portland, Oregon, and citizen groups around
   Puget Sound, Washington, are turning to a deceptively simple climate
   adaptation strategy called “assisted migration.”

   THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

   As the world’s climate warms, tree-growing ranges in the Northern
   Hemisphere are predicted to move farther north and higher in elevation.

   Trees, of course, can’t get up and walk to their new climatic homes. This
   is where assisted migration is supposed to lend a hand.

   The idea is that humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
   moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could
   migrate on their own.

   Yet not everyone agrees on what type of assisted migration the region
   needs — or that it’s always a good thing.

   In the Pacific Northwest, a divide has emerged between groups advocating
   for assisted migration that would help struggling native trees, and one
   that could instead see native species replaced on the landscape by trees
   from the south, including coast redwoods and giant sequoias.

   “There is a huge difference between assisted population migration and
   assisted species migration,” said Michael Case, forest ecologist at the
   Virginia-based Nature Conservancy.

   Related: Extreme heat represents a new threat to trees and plants in the
   Pacific Northwest

   Case currently runs an assisted population migration experiment at the
   Conservancy’s Ellsworth Creek Preserve in western Washington.

   Assisted population migration involves moving a native species' seeds, and
   by extension its genes, within its current growing range.

   By contrast, assisted species migration involves moving a species well
   outside its existing range, such as introducing redwoods and sequoias to
   Washington.

   A third form of assisted migration, called “range expansion,” amounts to
   moving a species just beyond its current growing range.

   Case’s project involves testing whether breeds of native Douglas fir and
   western hemlock from drier parts of the Pacific Northwest can be used to
   help western Washington forests adapt to climate change. He says the
   Nature Conservancy is focusing on population migration because it has
   fewer ecological risks.

   “Whenever you plant something in an area where it is not locally found you
   increase the risk of failure,” Case said. “You increase the risk of
   disturbing potential ecosystem functions and processes.”

   Population migration is the only form of assisted migration currently
   practiced nationwide by the Forest Service, according to David Lytle, the
   agency’s deputy chief for research and development.

   “We are very, very cautious and do not engage in the long-distance
   movement and establishment of plant material outside and disjunct from the
   historic range of a species,” said Lytle.

   The Forest Service is pursing assisted population migration because it’s
   likely to have few if any “negative consequences” to ecosystems, he said.

   Douglas Tallamy, professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the
   University of Delaware, said one potential negative consequence of species
   migration is the possibility that native caterpillars might not eat the
   leaves of migrated nonnative tree species. Because caterpillars feed birds
   and other animals, this could lead to disruptions to the food web.

   This could happen if the city of Portland migrates oak species from places
   to the south, Tallamy noted. “Oaks are the most important plant for
   supporting wildlife that we have in North America,” he said, “but when you
   move them out of range, the things that are adapted to eating them no
   longer have access to them.”

Portland’s experimentation with assisted migration of trees

   The city of Portland’s Urban Forestry program is currently experimenting
   with the assisted migration of 11 tree species, including three oak
   species to the south: California black oak, canyon live oak and interior
   live oak.

   Asked via email about potential ecological disruptions Portland’s City
   Forester @amp; Urban Forestry Manager Jenn Cairo responded: “We use research
   from universities, state and federal sources, and local and regional field
   practitioner experience.”

   Another advocate for species migration is the Puget Sound-based,
   citizen-led PropagationNation. The organization has planted trees in
   several parks in the Seattle area and has the ambitious goal of “bringing
   a million coast redwoods and giant sequoias to the Northwest,” according
   to its website.

   The PropagationNation website also recommends planting redwoods in areas
   where native western red cedar, western hemlock, Sitka spruce and big leaf
   maple already grow.

   Western red cedar, western hemlock and big leaf maple have all seen
   die-offs and growth declines in recent years tied to climate.

   Philip Stielstra, PropagationNation’s founder and president, and a retired
   Boeing employee, declined to comment for this story.

   David Milarch, founder of the Michigan-based Archangel Ancient Tree
   Archive, which has supplied PropagationNation with redwoods and sequoias,
   says his trees aren’t intended to replace Pacific Northwest native
   species.

   “All we are doing is extending the range (of redwoods and sequoias) north
   in the hopes that they will still be here in 100 to 200 years and not join
   the list of trees that are going extinct,” said Milarch.

Widespread assisted migration may be risky, Forest Service says

   Robert Slesak, research forester at the Pacific Northwest Research
   Station, runs the Forest Service’s Experimental Network for Assisted
   Migration and Establishment Silviculture, or ENAMES project, which
   oversees population migration sites in Washington, Oregon and California.

   Slesak called moving redwoods north a “risky proposition.” He said he has
   serious concerns about both assisted species migration and assisted
   migration efforts that lack experimental rigor.

   “Widespread assisted species migration without a lot of experimental
   results to guide it is risky,” said Slesak. “Everyone knows we need to do
   some kind of action related to climate, but there’s a real risk of making
   it worse.”

   Nevertheless, with the effects of climate change increasing, it’s a risk
   increasingly being assumed by public and private groups around the Pacific
   Northwest.

                    Compiler vs. Interpreter in Programming

   Compilers and interpreters are used to convert a high-level language into
   machine code. However, there are differences between how and when they
   work.

   I still remember a discussion with a colleague in which I said, “That’s
   the transpiler,” and he replied, “The…what?”

   If you’ve never heard that name, you’re not alone. As developers, we all
   get used to writing code in a high-level language that humans can
   understand. However, computers can only understand a program written in a
   binary system known as machine code.

   To speak to a computer in its non-human language, we came up with two
   solutions: interpreters and compilers. Ironically, most of us know very
   little about them, although they’re a part of our daily coding life.

Compilers vs. Interpreters Explained

     * Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming
       language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the
       program runs.
     * Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level
       programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. 

   In this post, I’ll dive into the journey of translating a high-level
   language into a machine code ready for execution. I’ll focus on the inner
   workings of the two key players in this game, the compiler and the
   interpreter, and break down the related concepts.

    

Compilers vs. Interpreters: How Do They Work?

   Compilers and interpreters have long been used as computer programs to
   transform code. But they work in different ways:

     * A compiler translates code written in a high-level programming
       language into a lower-level language like assembly language, object
       code and  machine code (binary 1 and 0 bits). It converts the code
       ahead of time before the program runs.
     * An interpreter translates the code line-by-line when the program is
       running. You’ve likely used interpreters unknowingly at some point in
       your work career.

Compilers vs. Interpreters: Advantages and Disadvantages

   Both compilers and interpreters have pros and cons:

     * A compiler takes in the entire program and requires a lot of time to
       analyze the source code. Whereas the interpreter takes a single line
       of code and very little time to analyze it.
     * Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.
     * A compiler displays all errors after compilation. If your code has
       mistakes, it will not compile. But the interpreter displays errors of
       each line one by one.
     * Interpretation does not replace compilation completely.
     * Compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons like
       faster performance and smaller memory footprint.

   A high-level programming language is usually referred to as “compiled
   language” or “interpreted language.” However, in practice, they can have
   both compiled and interpreted implementations. C, for example, is called a
   compiled language, despite the existence of C interpreters. The first
   JavaScript engines were simple interpreters, but all modern engines use
   just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance reasons.

    

4 Common Types of Interpreters to Know

   Interpreters were used as early as 1952 to ease programming and also
   translate between low-level machine languages. The first interpreted
   high-level language was Lisp. Python, Ruby, Perl and PHP are other
   examples of programming languages that use interpreters.

   Below is a list of interpreter’s types:

4 Types of Interpreters

    1. Bytecode interpreter
    2. Threaded code interpreter
    3. Abstract syntax tree interpreter
    4. Justin-in-time compilation

    

  1. Bytecode Interpreter

   The trend toward bytecode interpretation and just-in-time compilation
   blurs the distinction between compilers and interpreters. Bytecode
   interpreters can process up to 256 instructions, with each instruction
   starting with a byte. 

    

  2. Threaded Code Interpreter

   Unlike bytecode interpreters, threaded code interpreters use pointers
   instead of bytes. Each instruction is a word pointing to a function or an
   instruction sequence, possibly followed by a parameter. The number of
   different instructions is limited by the available memory and address
   space.

   Forth code, which is used in Open Firmware systems, is a classical example
   of threaded code. The source code is compiled into a bytecode known as “F
   code,” which a virtual machine then interprets.

    

  3. Abstract Syntax Tree Interpreter

   If you’re a TypeScript developer with some familiarity of the TypeScript
   architecture, you may have heard about the abstract syntax tree (AST).

   AST is an approach to transform the source code into an optimized abstract
   syntax tree, then execute the program following this tree structure, or
   use it to generate native code just-in-time.

   AST keeps the global program structure and relations between statements.
   This allows the system to perform better analysis during runtime and makes
   AST a better intermediate format for just-in-time compilers than bytecode
   representation.

   However, for interpreters, AST causes more overhead. Interpreters walking
   the abstract syntax tree are slower than those generating bytecode.

    

  4. Just-in-Time Compilation

   Just-in-time compilation (JIT) is a technique in which the intermediate
   representation is compiled to native machine code at runtime.

    

10 Common Types of Compilers to Know

   Below are the common types of compilers you should know.

10 Types of Compilers

    1. Cross-compiler
    2. Native compiler
    3. Bootstrap compiler
    4. Decompiler
    5. Source-to-source compiler
    6. Language rewriter
    7. Bytecode compiler
    8. Just-in-time compiler
    9. AOT compilation
   10. Assembler

    

  1. Cross-compiler

   A cross-compiler is one that runs on a computer whose CPU or operating
   system differs from the one on which the code it produces will run.

    

  2. Native Compiler

   A native compiler produces an output that would run on the same type of
   computer and operating system as the compiler itself.

    

  3. Bootstrap Compiler

   Bootstrap compiler is a compiler written in the language that it intends
   to compile.

    

  4. Decompiler

   A decompiler translates code from a low-level language to a higher level
   one.

    

  5. Source-to-Source Compiler (Transpiler)

   A source-to-source compiler is a program that translates between
   high-level languages. This type of compiler is also known as a
   transcompiler or transpiler.

   Some examples of a transpiler include:

     * Emscripten: This transpiles C/C++ to JavaScript.
     * Babel: This transpiles JavaScript code from ES6+ to ES5.
     * Cfront: The original compiler for C++ (from around 1983). It used C as
       its target language and created C code with no indent style and no
       pretty C intermediate code, since the generated code was not usually
       intended to be readable by humans.

    

  6. A Language Rewriter

   This is usually a program translating form of expressions without a change
   of language.

    

  7. Bytecode Compiler

   A compiler that translates a high-level language into an intermediate
   simple language that a bytecode interpreter or virtual machine can
   interpret. Examples include: Bytecode compilers for Java and Python.

    

  8. Just-in-Time Compiler (JIT Compiler)

   A JIT compiler defers compilation until runtime. It generally runs inside
   an interpreter.

   Examples of a JIT compiler include:

     * The earliest published JIT compiler is attributed to LISP in 1960.
     * The latter technique appeared in languages such as Smalltalk in the
       1980s.
     * Since then, JIT compilation has gained mainstream attention amongst
       modern languages like Java, .NET Framework, Python and most modern
       JavaScript implementations.

   In Java, source files are first compiled and converted into .class files
   that contain Java bytecode, a highly optimized set of instructions, then a
   bytecode interpreter executes the bytecode, and later the JIT compiler
   translates the bytecode to machine code.

   Java bytecode can either be interpreted at runtime by a virtual machine,
   or compiled at load time or runtime into native code. Modern JVM
   implementations use the compilation approach, so after the initial startup
   time the performance is equivalent to native code.

    

  9. AOT Compilation

   Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation is the approach of compiling a
   higher-level programming language, or an intermediate representation such
   as Java bytecode, before the runtime.

   An example of this is the Angular framework. This uses an ahead-of-time
   (AOT) compiler to transform HTML and TypeScript code into JavaScript code
   during the build time to provide a faster rendering later on the browser
   when the code is running.

    

  10. Assembler

   An assembler translates human-readable assembly language into machine
   code. This compilation process is called assembly. The inverse program
   that converts machine code to assembly language is called a disassembler.

   An assembly language (ASM) is a low-level programming language in which
   there is a dependence on the machine code instructions. That’s why every
   assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer
   architecture.

Why Compilers and Interpreters Are Important

   Both compilers and interpreters are computer programs that convert a code
   written in a high-level language into a lower-level or machine code
   understood by computers. However, there are differences in how they work
   and when to use them.

   Even if you’re not going to implement the next compiler or interpreter,
   these insights should help to improve your knowledge of the tools you use
   as a developer every day.

                      How to Parse and Generate HTML in Go

   By Ukeje Chukwuemeriwo Goodness (Goodnessuc)
   Published Feb 1, 2023

   Parsing and generating HTML is a no-brainer with the help of Golang's html
   and html/template package.

   random green symbols.

   Parsing is analyzing and interpreting a document's structure. The parsing
   process may include extracting specific elements, attributes, or data from
   the document and verifying that the document is well-formatted while
   following specific standards or rules. Parsing is mainly used for
   extracting data from web pages or manipulating the structure of web pages
   before displaying them to users.

   Go provides packages for working with documents, including the HTML and
   XML formats popularly used in webpages. The html package provides
   functions for tokenizing and parsing HTML.

The HTML Package

   The html package provides an HTML5-compliant tokenizer and parser for
   parsing and manipulating HTML documents, traversing the parse tree, and
   manipulating the tree structure. The html package is a built-in package of
   Go’s standard library.

   One of the main features of the html package is the Parse function that
   can parse HTML documents and return the root node of the parse tree, from
   where you can use functions like the FirstChild and NextSibling to
   navigate the tree and extract information from the document. The package
   also provides the ParseFragment function for parsing fragments of HTML
   documents.

   The EscapeString function is handy for escaping special characters in
   strings for safer inclusion in HTML; you can use this function to prevent
   cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by converting special characters to
   their corresponding HTML entities.

   To get started with the html package, you can import the package into your
   Go project files.

  import "golang.org/x/net/html"
 

   The html package doesn't provide any functions for generating HTML.
   Instead, you can use html/template package, which offers a set of
   functions for generating HTML templates. The html/template package
   provides a function template.HTMLEscape for writing escaped versions of
   HTML to a response writer.

   The html/template package is also part of the standard library, and here’s
   how you can import the package.

  import "html/template"
 

   The html package is the most popularly used templating package in the Go
   ecosystem and supports various operations and data types.

Parsing HTML in Go

   The Parse function of the html package helps with parsing HTML text and
   documents. The Parse function takes in an io.Reader instance as it’s a
   first argument containing the file document and an *html.Node instance,
   which is the root node of the HTML document

   Here’s how you can use the Parse function to parse a webpage and return
   all the URLs on the web page.

  import (
     "fmt"
     "golang.org/x/net/html"
     "net/http"
 )

 func main() {
     // Send an HTTP GET request to the example.com web page
     resp, err := http.Get("https://www.example.com")
     if err != nil {
         fmt.Println("Error:", err)
         return
     }
     defer resp.Body.Close()

     // Use the html package to parse the response body from the request
     doc, err := html.Parse(resp.Body)
     if err != nil {
         fmt.Println("Error:", err)
         return
     }

     
     // Find and print all links on the web page
     var links []string
     var link func(*html.Node)
     link = func(n *html.Node) {
         if n.Type == html.ElementNode @amp;@amp; n.Data == "a" {
             for _, a := range n.Attr {
                 if a.Key == "href" {
                     // adds a new link entry when the attribute matches
                     links = append(links, a.Val)
                 }
             }
         }

         // traverses the HTML of the webpage from the first child node
         for c := n.FirstChild; c != nil; c = c.NextSibling {
             link(c)
         }
     }
     link(doc)

     // loops through the links slice
     for _, l := range links {
         fmt.Println("Link:", l)
     }
 }
 

   The main function sends an HTTP GET request to the website with the Get
   function of the http package and retrieves the page response body. The
   Parse function of the html package parses the response body and returns
   the HTML document.

   The links variable is the slice of strings that will hold the URLs from
   the webpage. The link function takes in the pointer reference to the Node
   method for the html package, and the Key method of the attribute instance
   from the node returns data contained in a specified attribute (in this
   case, href). The function traverses the document with the NextSibling
   method from the FirstChild node to print every URL on the webpage.
   Finally, the for loop prints all the URLs from the links slice.

   Here’s the result of the operation.

   result of retrieving links from a webpage

Generating HTML in Go

   The html/template package provides a set of functions for the safe and
   efficient parsing and execution of HTML templates. The package is designed
   for use in conjunction with the html package, which provides functions for
   parsing and manipulating HTML.

   You can generate HTML for server-side rendering with the html/template
   package. Generating HTML is handy for many use cases like sending emails,
   server-side frontend rendering, and many more. You get to use built-in Go
   data types like maps and structs to interact and manipulate the HTML of
   your webpage.

   You’ll need to understand Go HTML templating syntax to successfully
   generate HTML with the html/template package.

  import (
     "html/template"
     "os"
 )

 type webPage struct {
     Title string
     Heading string
     Text string
 }

 func main() {
     // Define the template
     tmpl := `
 @lt;!DOCTYPE html@gt;
 @lt;html@gt;
 @lt;head@gt;
     @lt;title@gt;{{.Title}}@lt;/title@gt;
 @lt;/head@gt;
 @lt;body@gt;
     @lt;h1@gt;{{.Heading}}@lt;/h1@gt;
     @lt;p@gt;{{.Text}}@lt;/p@gt;
 @lt;/body@gt;
 @lt;/html@gt;`

     // Define the data to be used in the template
     web := webPage{
         Title: "An Example Page",
         Heading: "Welcome to my website!",
         Text: "This is the home page of my website.",
     }

     // Create a new template and parse the template string
     t, err := template.New("webpage").Parse(tmpl)
     if err != nil {
         panic(err)
     }

     // Execute the template and write the result to stdout
     err = t.Execute(os.Stdout, web )
     if err != nil {
         panic(err)
     }
 }
 

   The tmpl variable holds the HTML string. The HTML string uses Go
   templating syntax to define the page title, an h1 header, and a paragraph
   of text. The webPage struct defines the data fields for the webpage with
   the Title, Heading, and Text fields.

   The Parse method of the New function of the template package creates and
   parses a new template with the template string. The Execute function of
   the new template instance executes the template with the data from your
   struct instance and returns the result to the standard output (in this
   case, it prints the result to the console).

Build Web Applications With Go

   Learning about parsing and generating HTML with Go is one step in the
   right direction toward building more sophisticated web applications with
   Go. You can use frameworks like Gin and Echo and routers like Gorilla Mux
   and the Chi Router to build the server side of your web application.

   These packages are built on the net/http package (the built-in package for
   interacting with HTTP in Go) and abstract the complexities of setting up
   servers and routers in Go.

                      How Database B-Tree Indexing Works 

   B-tree is used for indexing and is a data structure that provides sorted
   data and allows searches, sequential access, attachments and removals in
   sorted order.

   When we think about the performance of a database, indexing is the first
   thing that comes to the mind. Here, we’re going to look into how database
   indexing works on a database. 

B-Tree Indexing Explained

   B-tree indexing is the process of sorting large blocks of data to make
   searching through that data faster and easier. A B-tree stores data such
   that each node contains keys in ascending order. Each of these keys has
   two references to another two child nodes. The left side child node keys
   are less than the current keys, and the right side child node keys are
   more than the current keys. Its search time is O(log(n)). 

   The architectural details described below are for the SQLite 2.x database
   architecture. You can find out the back end implementation of SQLite 2.5.0
   with tests.

    

What Is B-tree?

   A B-tree is a data structure that provides sorted data and allows
   searches, sequential access, attachments and removals in sorted order. The
   B-tree is highly capable of storing systems that write large blocks of
   data. The B-tree simplifies the binary search tree by allowing nodes with
   more than two children. Below is a B-tree example.

   Madushan

   B-tree stores data such that each node contains keys in ascending order.
   Each of these keys has two references to another two child nodes. The left
   side child node keys are less than the current keys, and the right side
   child node keys are more than the current keys. If a single node has “n”
   number of keys, then it can have maximum “n+1” child nodes.

Why B-Tree Indexing Is Necessary

   Imagine that you need to store a list of numbers in a file and search a
   given number on that list. The simplest solution is to store data in an
   array and append values when new values come in. But if you need to check
   if a given value exists in the array, then you need to search through each
   of the array elements one by one and check whether the given value
   exists. 

   If you’re lucky, you might find the given value in the first element. But
   in the worst case scenario, the value could be the last element in the
   array. We denote this worst case as O(n) in asymptotic notation. This
   means if your array size is “n,” at most, you need to complete “n” number
   of searches to find a given value in an array.

   How could you improve this time? The easiest solution is to sort the array
   and use binary search to find the value. Whenever you insert a value into
   the array, it should maintain order. The search starts by selecting a
   value from the middle of the array. Then it compares the selected value
   with the search value. If the selected value is greater than the search
   value, then it ignores the left side of the array and searches the value
   on the right side, and vice versa.

   Illustration of a binary searchIllustration of a binary search. | Image:
   Dhanushka Madushan

   Here, we try to search key 15 from the array 3,6,8,11,15 and 18, which is
   already in sorted order. If you do a normal search, then it will take five
   units of time, since the element is in the fifth position. But in a binary
   search, it will only take three searches.

   If we apply this binary search to all of the elements in the array, then
   it would be as follows.

   Illustration of a binary search to all elementsIllustration of a binary
   search to all elements. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   Look familiar? It’s a binary tree. This is the simplest form of the
   B-tree. For a binary tree, we can use pointers instead of keeping data in
   a sorted array. Mathematically, we can prove that the worst case search
   time for a binary tree is O(log(n)). 

   The concept of Binary tree can be extended into a more generalized form,
   which is known as B-tree. Instead of having a single entry for a single
   node, B-tree uses an array of entries for a single node and has references
   to a child node for each of these entries. Below are some time complexity
   comparisons of each pre-described method.

   structures. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

    

B+Tree vs. B-Tree: What’s the Difference?

   B+ tree is another data structure that’s used to store data and looks
   almost the same as the B-tree. The only difference is that B+ tree stores
   data on the leaf nodes. This means that all non-leaf node values are
   duplicated in leaf nodes again. Below is a sample B+tree.

   An illustration of a B+treeAn illustration of a B+tree. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

    The 13, 30, 9, 11, 16 and 38 non-leaf values are again repeated in leaf
   nodes. 

   Leaf nodes include all values and all of the records are in sorted order.
   B+tree allows you to do the same search as B-tree, but it also allows you
   to  travel through all the values in a leaf node if we put a pointer to
   each leaf node as follows.

   B+tree with leaf node referencing. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

    

How Is B-Tree Indexing Used in a Database?

   When B-tree comes to the database indexing, this data structure gets a
   little complicated because it doesn’t just have a key, it also has a value
   associated with the key. This value is a reference to the actual data
   record. The key and value together are called a payload.

   Assume the following three-column table needs to be stored on a database:

   three column data tableA three-column data record. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   First, the database creates a unique random index (or primary key) for
   each of the given records and converts the relevant rows into a byte
   stream. Then, it stores each of the keys and record byte streams on a
   B+tree. Here, the random index used as the key for indexing. The key and
   record byte stream is altogether known as Payload. The resulting B+tree
   could be represented as follows.

   A B+tree on database pagesA B+tree on database pages. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   Here you can see that all records are stored in the leaf nodes of the
   B+tree and index and are used as the key to create a B+tree. No records
   are stored on non-leaf nodes. Each of the leaf nodes references the next
   record in the tree. A database can perform a binary search by using the
   index or sequential search by searching through every element by only
   traveling through the leaf nodes.

   If no indexing is used, then the database reads each of these records to
   find the given record. When indexing is enabled, the database creates
   three B-trees for each of the columns in the table, as follows. Here the
   key is the B-tree key used to index. The index is the reference to the
   actual data record:

   B-tree used as an index to the actual recordB-tree used as an index to the
   actual record. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   When indexing is used first, the database searches a given key in
   correspondence to B-tree and gets the index in O(log(n)) time. Then, it
   performs another search in B+tree by using the already found index in
   O(log(n)) time and gets the record.

   Each of these nodes in B-tree and B+tree is stored inside the pages. Pages
   are fixed in size. Pages have a unique number starting from one. A page
   can be a reference to another page by using a page number. At the
   beginning of the page, page meta details such as the rightmost child page
   number, first free cell offset and the first cell offset stored. There can
   be two types of pages in a database:

    1. Pages for indexing: These pages store only an index and a reference to
       another page.
    2. Pages to store records: These pages store the actual data and the page
       should be a leaf page.

    

Using SQLite B-Tree Indexing

   The basic syntax to create a B-tree index as follows:

 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;

   There are three kinds of indexing methods used in SQLite.

    

  1. Single Column Index

   Here, indexes are created based on one table column. Only a single B-tree
   is created for indexes. The syntax is as follows.

 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

    

  2. Unique Index

   Unique indexes aren’t allowed to store duplicate values for the column
   that uses indexing. The syntax can be written as follows:

 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name on table_name (column_name);

    

  3. Composite Index

   This type of index can have multiple indexes. For each of the index
   columns, There exists a Btree. The following is the syntax for composite
   index:

 CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (column1, column2);

Advantages of B-Tree Indexing

   Databases should have an efficient way to store, read, and modify data.
   B-tree provides an efficient way to insert and read data. In actual
   database implementation, the database uses both B-tree and B+tree together
   to store data. B-tree used for indexing and B+tree used to store the
   actual records. B+tree provides sequential search capabilities in addition
   to the binary search, which gives the database more control to search
   non-index values in a database.

   A linden tree has large, spreading branches.Evergreen trees keep their
   needlelike leaves year-round.Trees are tall, woody plants. They usually
   have a stem called a trunk. Trees are some of the largest and oldest
   living things on Earth. Some trees live for hundreds or even thousands of
   years. There are more than 80,000 species, or types, of tree. Well-known
   trees include birches, firs, maples, palms, and pines.

   Plants called conifers have cones that contain the plant's seeds.Some
   trees have flowers in the spring.The Lawson cypress and the English elm
   look different because they are two different types of tree.…Scientists
   divide trees into groups based on how they reproduce. Some trees reproduce
   with spores, or particles that grow into new plants. They are called tree
   ferns. Most trees reproduce with seeds. Some seed-bearing trees grow their
   seeds in cones. They are called conifers. Most seed-bearing trees grow
   their seeds in fruits or pods. They are known as broad-leaved or flowering
   trees.

   Scientists also group trees based on whether they lose their leaves. Trees
   that keep their leaves year-round are called evergreens. Trees that lose
   their leaves during the autumn and winter are called deciduous trees.

    Physical Features

   Coast redwood trees are the tallest trees.Trees are usually more than 10
   feet (3 meters) tall. They have roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves. The
   trunk and branches are made of fibers called wood. These fibers are
   protected by an outer covering called bark. As the tree ages, the trunk
   and branches thicken. In some cases the number of rings in the trunk shows
   the age of the tree.

   The leaves make food for the tree through a process called photosynthesis.
   Veins run through the leaves. They carry water and food to and from the
   branches. Leaves are usually green. The leaves of deciduous trees often
   change colors in autumn before they fall off. New leaves then grow in
   spring.

   Trees are home to many animals, including koalas.Trees are very important
   to people and other animals. Many animals, including some birds, monkeys,
   apes, sloths, frogs, and squirrels live in trees. They also get their food
   from trees, including leaves, nuts, and fruits. For example, koalas spend
   most of their time in eucalyptus trees and eat only eucalyptus leaves.
   People use tree wood to build homes and furniture. Paper is made from wood
   fibers. Many people burn wood to cook and to heat their homes. Farmers
   plant orchards of trees that grow fruit for humans to eat.

   Many people enjoy hiking and playing in parks and forests.Many cities
   plant trees in parks and along streets to make those areas pleasant to
   look at and to spend time in. Forests and parks are places that protect
   trees and other plants for everyone to enjoy.

   Trees also help keep the air clean. They release oxygen for animals,
   including humans, to breathe. They take in the carbon dioxide that animals
   breathe out. Dead twigs and leaves release nutrients into the soil. Tree
   roots help to prevent soil erosion

   Because of the importance of trees, many governments around the world have
   tried to stop people from cutting down trees in the wilderness. But
   deforestation is still a problem in many parts of the world.

   [IMG]A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
   [IMG]It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
   men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
   emanates from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
   spirit. ~ Robert Louis Stevenson [IMG]The earth brought forth vegetation,
   plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit
   in which is their seed, according to its kind. And God saw that it was
   good. ~ Genesis 1:12.

   Trees are plants with elongated stems, or trunks, supporting leaves or
   branches. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always
   been revered and they play a role in much of the world's mythology,
   metaphor and symbolism.

Quotes[edit]

  General[edit]

   [IMG]A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
   leaves; the tree species, in fact,it needs and evolves to fight the moose,
   to keep the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
   twigs. - Robert T. Bakker
     * He who saves an ancient tree does better even than he who plants a new
       one.
          * Alfred Austin, In Veronica's Garden (London: Macmillan and Co.,
            1895), p. 70.
     * A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
       leaves; the tree species, in fact, evolves to fight the moose, to keep
       the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
       twigs. In the final analysis, the merciless hand of natural selection
       will favor the birch genes that make the tree less and less palatable
       to the moose in generation after generation. No plant species could
       survive for long by offering itself as unprotected fodder.
          * Robert T. Bakker, The Dinosaur Heresies: A Revolutionary View of
            Dinosaurs (1986), Longman Scientific @amp; Technical, p. 179.
     * A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
          * William Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790–1793).
     * The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others
       only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see Nature all
       ridicule and deformity, and some scarce see Nature at all. But to the
       eyes of the man of imagination, Nature is Imagination itself.
          * William Blake, The Letters (1799).
     * Lo que soñó la tierra/es visible en el árbol.
          * What the earth dreamt/is written in the tree.
          * The selected poems of Rosario Castellanos (1989)
     * I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to
       live than other things do.
          * Willa Cather, O Pioneers (1913).
     * As by the way of innuendo
       Lucus is made a non lucendo.
          * Charles Churchill, The Ghost (1763), Book II. V. 257. "Lucus a
            non lucendo.—Lucus (a grove), from non lucendo (not admitting
            light)." A derivation given by Quintilian I. 16, and by others.
     * No tree in all the grove but has its charms,
       Though each its hue peculiar.
          * William Cowper, The Task (1785), Book I, line 307.
     * Some boundless contiguity of shade.
          * William Cowper, The Task (1785), Book II.
     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves —
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       *****
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view —
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Pull of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.
          * Dinah Craik, The Mulberry-Tree, reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia
            Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 634.
     * He that planteth a tree is the servant of God,
       He provideth a kindness for many generations,
       And faces that he hath not seen shall bless him.
          * Henry van Dyke, The Friendly Trees.
     * All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All
       these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it
       from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual
       towards freedom.
          * Albert Einstein, in "Moral Decay" (1937); later published in Out
            of My Later Years (1950).
     * Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they
       had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which
       do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three
       years till the new comes.
          * The Book of Enoch ch.3 [1]
     * When iron was found, the trees began to tremble, but the iron
       reassured them: 'Let no handle made from you enter into anything made
       from me, and I shall be powerless to injure you.'
          * Genesis Rabbah 5, Tales and Maxims from the Midrash by Rev.
            Samuel Rapaport, (1907), p. 61
     * If you love me, be patient. Look at the trees. Are they in a hurry to
       ripen their fruit?
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Last Temptation of Christ (1951)
     * The entire Earth, with her trees and her waters, with her animals,
       with her men and her gods, calls from within your breast.
       Earth rises up in your brains and sees her entire body for the first
       time.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "Fourth Step :
            The Earth"
     * Every man has his own circle composed of trees, animals, men, ideas,
       and he is in duty bound to save this circle. He, and no one else. If
       he does not save it, he cannot be saved.
       These are the labors each man is given and is in duty bound to
       complete before he dies. He may not otherwise be saved. For his own
       soul is scattered and enslaved in these things about him, in trees, in
       animals, in men, in ideas, and it is his own soul he saves by
       completing these labors.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "The Action :
            The Relationship between Man and Nature"
     * From the acorn, quickly sprouting,
       Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy, Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,
       Pressed compactly all the grasses, From the ground enriched by ashes,
       That the maidens had been raking, Newly raked by water-maidens;
       When a fire within them kindles, Spread the oak-tree's many branches,
       And the flames shot up to heaven, Rounds itself a broad corona,
       Till the windrows burned to ashes, Raises it above the storm-clouds;
       Only ashes now remaining
       Far it stretches out its branches,
       Of the grasses raked together. Stops the white-clouds in their
       courses,
       In the ashes of the windrows, With its branches hides the sunlight,
       Tender leaves the giant places, With its many leaves, the moonbeams,
       In the leaves he plants an acorn, And the starlight dies in heaven.
          * Kalevala, Rune II. translated by John Martin Crawford (1888). [2]
     * Trees — especially old trees — have a strong and definite
       individuality, well worthy the name of a soul. This soul, though
       temporary, in the sense that it is not yet a reincarnating entity, is
       nevertheless possessed of considerable power and intelligence along
       its own lines. It has decided likes and dislikes, and to clairvoyant
       sight it shows quite clearly by a vivid rosy flush an emphatic
       enjoyment of the sunlight and the rain, and distinct pleasure also in
       the presence of those whom it has learnt to like, or with whom it has
       sympathetic vibrations. Emerson appears to have realised this, for he
       is quoted in Hutton’s Reminiscences as saying of his trees:

           "I am sure they miss me ; they seem to droop when I go away, and I
           know they brighten and bloom when I go back to them and shake
           hands with their lower branches.”

     * Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,
       A sylvan scene, and as the ranks ascend
       Shade above shade, a woody theatre
       Of stateliest view.

     * It's interesting, isn't it? There are many stories about trees giving
       curses (Tatari) in the Western part of Japan. Such folklore, or
       something that goes back to our distant memories, remains strongly in
       Japanese culture. People on Yakushima Island didn't cut the trees.
       They thought that cutting trees would bring about a curse. Trees are
       beings that make us feel that way. I learned it when I went to
       Yakushima. When they decided to cut and sell trees because they were
       too poor to eat, there was a monk who recommended cutting the trees.
       It was not the case that they started cutting tress because a certain
       person happened to be on the island and said so, but rather to do with
       the changes in the society itself.

     * I think that I shall never see
       A billboard lovely as a tree.
       Perhaps, unless the billboards fall,
       I'll never see a tree at all.
          * Ogden Nash, Song of the Open Road (1933).
     * Perhaps you see big trees and little trees and think that big trees
       are older than little trees. You also might notice that there are more
       little trees than big trees, and so not every little tree grows up to
       be a big tree – most die young. But the little trees must come from
       somewhere, namely seeds produced and shed by the bigger trees. These
       are the core ideas of population ecology.

     * Trees perspire profusely, condense largely, and check evaporation so
       much, that woods are always moist: no wonder therefore that they
       contribute much to pools and streams.
       That trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well
       known fact in North-America; for, since the woods and forests have
       been grubbed and cleared, all bodies of water have much diminished; so
       that some streams, that were very considerable a century ago, will not
       now drive a common mill.

    Almond (Prunus dulcis)[edit]

   [IMG]I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God"
   and the almond tree blossomed. ~ Nikos Kazantzakis [IMG]Here was an almond
   tree in bloom before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. ~
   Nikos Kazantzakis
     * I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God."
       and the almond tree blossomed.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Fratricides (1964)
     * I heard the bells from the future churches, the children playing and
       laughing in the schoolyards … and here was an almond tree in bloom
       before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. For, by
       believing passionately in something which still does not exist, we
       create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently
       desired, whatever we have not irrigated with our blood to such a
       degree that it becomes strong enough to stride across the somber
       threshold of nonexistence.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in Report to Greco (1965)

    Ash (Fraxinus)[edit]

     * The ash her purple drops forgivingly
       And sadly, breaking not the general hush;
       The maple swamps glow like a sunset sea,
       Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
       All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze,

    Aspen (Populus Tremuloides)[edit]

     * THE quiet of the evening hour
       Was laid on every summer leaf;
       That purple shade was on each flower,
       At once so beautiful, so brief,
       Only the aspen knew not rest,
       But still, with an unquiet song,
       Kept murmuring to the gentle west,
       And cast a changeful shade along.

            August, 1830, 'The Aspen Tree', also published in The Vow of the

     * What whispers so strange at the hour of midnight,
       From the aspen leaves trembling so wildly?
       Why in the lone wood sings it sad, when the bright
       Full moon beams upon it so mildly?
          * B. S. Ingemann, The Aspen.
     * At that awful hour of the Passion, when the Saviour of the world felt
       deserted in His agony, when—
       "The sympathizing sun his light withdrew,
       And wonder'd how the stars their dying Lord could view"—
       when earth, shaking with horror, rung the passing bell for Deity, and
       universal nature groaned, then from the loftiest tree to the lowliest
       flower all felt a sudden thrill, and trembling, bowed their heads, all
       save the proud and obdurate aspen, which said, "Why should we weep and
       tremble? we trees, and plants, and flowers are pure and never sinned!"
       Ere it ceased to speak, an involuntary trembling seized its very leaf,
       and the word went forth that it should never rest, but tremble on
       until the day of judgment.
          * Legend, from Notes and Queries, first series, Volume VI, No. 161.

    Mulberry Tree (Morus)[edit]

     * Retracing our steps to the garden we see two trees which are redolent
       of the past - a medlar and a mulberry. This last is not a beautiful
       tree. It covers itself with such dense masses of heavy foliage; its
       form has neither grace nor dignity - and yet we love it.

     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves—
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       * * * * *
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view—
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Full of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.

     * Ancient Pines,
       Ye bear no record of the years of man.
       Spring is your sole historian.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.
     * Stately Pines,
       But few more years around the promontory
       Your chant will meet the thunders of the sea.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.

    Poplar (Populus Fastigiata)[edit]

     * We knew it would rain, for the poplars showed
       The white of their leaves, the amber grain
       Shrunk in the wind,—and the lightning now
       Is tangled in tremulous skeins of rain.
          * Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Before the Rain, reported in Hoyt's New
            Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 655.
     * Trees that, like the poplar, hit upward all their boughs, give no
       shade and no shelter, whatever their height. Trees the most lovingly
       shelter and shade us, when, like the willow, the higher soar their
       summits, the lowlier droop their boughs.
          * Edward Bulwer-Lytton, What Will He Do With It? (1858), Book XI,
            Chapter X, introductory lines.

    Tulip-Tree (Liriodendron Tulipifera)[edit]

     * Heed not the night; a summer lodge amid the wild is mine—
       'Tis shadowed by the tulip-tree, 'tis mantled by the vine.
          * William Cullen Bryant, A Strange Lady, Stanza 6; reported in
            Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.
     * The tulip-tree, high up,
       Opened, in airs of June, her multitude
       Of golden chalices to humming birds
       And silken-winged insects of the sky.
          * William Cullen Bryant, The Fountain, Stanza 3; reported in Hoyt's
            New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.

    Umbellularia[edit]

     * The Spice-Tree lives in the garden green,
       Beside it the fountain flows;
       And a fair Bird sits the boughs between,
       And sings his melodious woes.
       * * * * * *
       That out-bound stem has branches three;
       On each a thousand blossoms grow;
       And old as aught of time can be,
       The root stands fast in the rocks below.
          * John Sterling, The Spice-Tree, Stanzas 1 and 3.

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   The abstract data type (ADT) can be represented in a number of ways,
   including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children
   with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of
   parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list).
   Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes
   or ancestor lists for performance.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

Applications[edit]

   Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in
   applications such as:

     * File systems for:
          * Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files
            (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links
            to the same file or directory)
          * The mechanism used to allocate and link blocks of data on the
            storage device
     * Class hierarchy or "inheritance tree" showing the relationships among
       classes in object-oriented programming; multiple inheritance produces
       non-tree graphs
     * Abstract syntax trees for computer languages
     * Natural language processing:
          * Parse trees
          * Modeling utterances in a generative grammar
          * Dialogue tree for generating conversations
     * Document Object Models ("DOM tree") of XML and HTML documents
     * Search trees store data in a way that makes an efficient search
       algorithm possible via tree traversal
          * A binary search tree is a type of binary tree
     * Representing sorted lists of data
     * Computer-generated imagery:
          * Space partitioning, including binary space partitioning
          * Digital compositing
     * Storing Barnes–Hut trees used to simulate galaxies
     * Implementing heaps
     * Nested set collections
     * Hierarchical taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification with
       sections of increasing specificity.
     * Hierarchical temporal memory
     * Genetic programming
     * Hierarchical clustering

   Trees can be used to represent and manipulate various mathematical
   structures, such as:

     * Paths through an arbitrary node-and-edge graph (including
       multigraphs), by making multiple nodes in the tree for each graph node
       used in multiple paths
     * Any mathematical hierarchy

   Tree structures are often used for mapping the relationships between
   things, such as:

     * Components and subcomponents which can be visualized in an
       exploded-view drawing
     * Subroutine calls used to identify which subroutines in a program call
       other subroutines non recursively
     * Inheritance of DNA among species by evolution, of source code by
       software projects (e.g. Linux distribution timeline), of designs in
       various types of cars, etc.
     * The contents of hierarchical namespaces

   JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically
   represented by nested lists and dictionaries.

Terminology[edit]

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
   except the topmost root node, which has none. A node might have many
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Other terms used with trees:

   Neighbor
           Parent or child.

   Ancestor
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

   Descendant
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also
           known as subchild.

   Degree
           For a given node, its number of children. A leaf, by definition,
           has degree zero.

   Degree of tree
           The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node in the tree.

   Distance
           The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.

   Level
           The level of a node is the number of edges along the unique path
           between it and the root node.^[3] This is the same as depth.

   Width
           The number of nodes in a level.

   Breadth
           The number of leaves.

   Forest
           A set of one or more disjoint trees.

   Ordered tree
           A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children
           of each vertex. The book The Art of Computer Programming uses the
           term oriented tree.^[4]

   Size of a tree
           Number of nodes in the tree.

Examples of trees and non-trees[edit]

   [IMG]
   Not a tree: two non-connected parts, A→B and C→D→E. There is more than one
   root.
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: undirected cycle 1-2-4-3. 4 has more than one parent (inbound
   edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle B→C→E→D→B. B has more than one parent (inbound edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle A→A. A is the root but it also has a parent.
   [IMG]
   Each linear list is trivially a tree.

Common operations[edit]

     * Enumerating all the items
     * Enumerating a section of a tree
     * Searching for an item
     * Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
     * Deleting an item
     * Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
     * Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
     * Finding the root for any node
     * Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes

  Traversal and search methods[edit]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
   fixed size, the nodes might be stored in a list. Nodes and relationships
   between nodes might be stored in a separate special type of adjacency
   list. In relational databases, nodes are typically represented as table
   rows, with indexed row IDs facilitating pointers between parents and
   children.

   Nodes can also be stored as items in an array, with relationships between
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of
   the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the
   tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

   Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example
   with natural numbers.^[5]

Type theory[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to   
         remove this template message)                                        

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

           value: T → E
           children: T → F
           nil: () → F
           node: E × F → T

   with the axioms:

           value(node(e, f)) = e
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the
   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

Mathematical terminology[edit]

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
          * which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away
            from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from
            is called the parent and the node that the edge points to is
            called the child), together with:
     * an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in
       graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree – it need not
       include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a
       subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense
       (unless there are no descendants).

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   The abstract data type (ADT) can be represented in a number of ways,
   including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children
   with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of
   parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list).
   Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes
   or ancestor lists for performance.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

Applications[edit]

   Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in
   applications such as:

     * File systems for:
          * Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files
            (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links
            to the same file or directory)
          * The mechanism used to allocate and link blocks of data on the
            storage device
     * Class hierarchy or "inheritance tree" showing the relationships among
       classes in object-oriented programming; multiple inheritance produces
       non-tree graphs
     * Abstract syntax trees for computer languages
     * Natural language processing:
          * Parse trees
          * Modeling utterances in a generative grammar
          * Dialogue tree for generating conversations
     * Document Object Models ("DOM tree") of XML and HTML documents
     * Search trees store data in a way that makes an efficient search
       algorithm possible via tree traversal
          * A binary search tree is a type of binary tree
     * Representing sorted lists of data
     * Computer-generated imagery:
          * Space partitioning, including binary space partitioning
          * Digital compositing
     * Storing Barnes–Hut trees used to simulate galaxies
     * Implementing heaps
     * Nested set collections
     * Hierarchical taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification with
       sections of increasing specificity.
     * Hierarchical temporal memory
     * Genetic programming
     * Hierarchical clustering

   Trees can be used to represent and manipulate various mathematical
   structures, such as:

     * Paths through an arbitrary node-and-edge graph (including
       multigraphs), by making multiple nodes in the tree for each graph node
       used in multiple paths
     * Any mathematical hierarchy

   Tree structures are often used for mapping the relationships between
   things, such as:

     * Components and subcomponents which can be visualized in an
       exploded-view drawing
     * Subroutine calls used to identify which subroutines in a program call
       other subroutines non recursively
     * Inheritance of DNA among species by evolution, of source code by
       software projects (e.g. Linux distribution timeline), of designs in
       various types of cars, etc.
     * The contents of hierarchical namespaces

   JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically
   represented by nested lists and dictionaries.

Terminology[edit]

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
   except the topmost root node, which has none. A node might have many
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Other terms used with trees:

   Neighbor
           Parent or child.

   Ancestor
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

   Descendant
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also
           known as subchild.

   Degree
           For a given node, its number of children. A leaf, by definition,
           has degree zero.

   Degree of tree
           The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node in the tree.

   Distance
           The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.

   Level
           The level of a node is the number of edges along the unique path
           between it and the root node.^[3] This is the same as depth.

   Width
           The number of nodes in a level.

   Breadth
           The number of leaves.

   Forest
           A set of one or more disjoint trees.

   Ordered tree
           A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children
           of each vertex. The book The Art of Computer Programming uses the
           term oriented tree.^[4]

   Size of a tree
           Number of nodes in the tree.

Examples of trees and non-trees[edit]

   [IMG]
   Not a tree: two non-connected parts, A→B and C→D→E. There is more than one
   root.
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: undirected cycle 1-2-4-3. 4 has more than one parent (inbound
   edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle B→C→E→D→B. B has more than one parent (inbound edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle A→A. A is the root but it also has a parent.
   [IMG]
   Each linear list is trivially a tree.

Common operations[edit]

     * Enumerating all the items
     * Enumerating a section of a tree
     * Searching for an item
     * Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
     * Deleting an item
     * Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
     * Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
     * Finding the root for any node
     * Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes

  Traversal and search methods[edit]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
   fixed size, the nodes might be stored in a list. Nodes and relationships
   between nodes might be stored in a separate special type of adjacency
   list. In relational databases, nodes are typically represented as table
   rows, with indexed row IDs facilitating pointers between parents and
   children.

   Nodes can also be stored as items in an array, with relationships between
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of
   the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the
   tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

   Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example
   with natural numbers.^[5]

Type theory[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

           value: T → E
           children: T → F
           nil: () → F
           node: E × F → T

   with the axioms:

           value(node(e, f)) = e
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the
   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

Mathematical terminology[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to   
         remove this template message)                                        

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
          * which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away
            from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from
            is called the parent and the node that the edge points to is
            called the child), together with:
     * an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in
       graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree – it need not
       include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a
       subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense
       (unless there are no descendants).

     A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to
     represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and
     search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has
     a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

     The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it
     are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and
     these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a
     recursive structure.

   This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in
   the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node,
   structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can
   also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves
   connected with one another.

Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:

     * Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the
       parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.
     * Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is
       called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child
       nodes of {B}.
     * Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have
       any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the
       tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly
       one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
     * Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child
       nodes are called leaf nodes. {K, L, M, N, O, P, G} are the leaf nodes
       of the tree.
     * Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to
       that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor
       nodes of the node {E}
     * Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that
       node. {E,I} are the descendants of the node {B}.
     * Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E}
       are called siblings.
     * Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to
       that node. The root node has level 0.
     * Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
     * Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called
       neighbors of that node.
     * Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.

Representation of Tree Data Structure:

     A tree consists of a root, and zero or more subtrees T_1, T_2, … , T_k
     such that there is an edge from the root of the tree to the root of each
     subtree.

  Representation of a Node in Tree Data Structure:

     struct Node
     {
        int data;
        struct Node *first_child;
        struct Node *second_child;
        struct Node *third_child;
        .
        .
        .
        struct Node *nth_child;
     };

  Example of Tree data structure

    

   Here,

     * Node 1 is the root node
     * 1 is the parent of 2 and 3
     * 2 and 3 are the siblings
     * 4, 5, 6, and 7 are the leaf nodes
     * 1 and 2 are the ancestors of 5

Types of Tree data structures:

   Types of Trees in Data Structure based on the number of children

     * Binary tree: In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two
       children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full
       binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and
       degenerate or pathological binary trees.
     * Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each
       node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”,
       “mid” and “right”.
     * N-ary Tree or Generic Tree: Generic trees are a collection of nodes
       where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a
       list of references to its children(duplicate references are not
       allowed). Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of
       multiple nodes.

Basic Operation Of Tree Data Structure:

     * Create – create a tree in the data structure.
     * Insert − Inserts data in a tree.
     * Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is
       present or not.
     * Traversal:
          * Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order
            manner in the data structure.
          * In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order
            manner.
          * Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order
            manner.

Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?

   The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e., they are
   not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or we
   can say it is a hierarchical structure. For this reason, the tree is
   considered to be a non-linear data structure.

Properties of Tree Data Structure:

     * Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two
       nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is
       only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.
     * Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the
       path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to
       the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the
       path from the root of the tree to the node.
     * Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of
       the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest
       path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is
       called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0.
       The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the
       nodes in the tree.

Need for Tree Data Structure

   1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information
   that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a
   computer: 

   File System

   2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search
   (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
   3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and
   slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
   4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on
   the number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

Application of Tree Data Structure:

     * File System:  This allows for efficient navigation and organization of
       files.
     * Data Compression: Huffman coding is a popular technique for data
       compression that involves constructing a binary tree where the leaves
       represent characters and their frequency of occurrence. The resulting
       tree is used to encode the data in a way that minimizes the amount of
       storage required.
     * Compiler Design: In compiler design, a syntax tree is used to
       represent the structure of a program. 
     * Database Indexing: B-trees and other tree structures are used in
       database indexing to efficiently search for and retrieve data.

   article.

Advantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Tree offer Efficient Searching Depending on the type of tree, with
       average search times of O(log n) for balanced trees like AVL. 
     * Trees provide a hierarchical representation of data, making it easy to
       organize and navigate large amounts of information.
     * The recursive nature of trees makes them easy to traverse and
       manipulate using recursive algorithms.

   To learn more about the advantages of Tree Data Structure, refer to this
   article.

Disadvantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Unbalanced Trees, meaning that the height of the tree is skewed
       towards one side, which can lead to inefficient search times.
     * Trees demand more memory space requirements than some other data
       structures like arrays and linked lists, especially if the tree is
       very large.
     * The implementation and manipulation of trees can be complex and
       require a good understanding of the algorithms.

   In mathematics, Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees
   over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under
   homeomorphic embedding.

History[edit]

   The theorem was conjectured by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved by Joseph
   Kruskal (1960); a short proof was given by Crispin Nash-Williams (1963).
   It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a
   statement that cannot be proved in ATR_0 (a second-order arithmetic theory
   with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion).

   In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the
   Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in
   reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function
   which dwarfs TREE(3). A finitary application of the theorem gives the
   existence of the fast-growing TREE function.

Statement[edit]

   The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's
   formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

   Given a tree T with a root, and given vertices v, w, call w a successor of
   v if the unique path from the root to w contains v, and call w an
   immediate successor of v if additionally the path from v to w contains no
   other vertex.

   Take X to be a partially ordered set. If T_1, T_2 are rooted trees with
   vertices labeled in X, we say that T_1 is inf-embeddable in T_2 and write
   T_1 ≤ T_2 if there is an injective map F from the vertices of T_1 to the
   vertices of T_2 such that

     * For all vertices v of T_1, the label of v precedes the label of F(v),
     * If w is any successor of v in T_1, then F(w) is a successor of F(v),
       and
     * If w_1, w_2 are any two distinct immediate successors of v, then the
       path from F(w_1) to F(w_2) in T_2 contains F(v).

   Kruskal's tree theorem then states:

     If X is well-quasi-ordered, then the set of rooted trees with labels in
     X is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above.
     (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T_1, T_2, … of rooted trees
     labeled in X, there is some i @lt; j so that T_i ≤ T_j.)

Friedman's work[edit]

   For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and
   proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or
   the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the
   theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much
   weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first
   observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the
   then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees
   above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has size
   one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR_0,^[1] thus
   giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably
   impredicative proof.^[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0, but by adding a "gap condition"^[3] to the definition of the
   order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem
   unprovable in this system.^[4]^[5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour
   theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0.

   Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the
   proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal
   (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).^[citation needed]

Weak tree function[edit]

   Suppose that P(n) is the statement:

           There is some m such that if T_1, ..., T_m is a finite sequence of
           unlabeled rooted trees where T_i has i + n vertices, then
           T_i ≤ T_j for some i @lt; j.

   All the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and
   Kőnig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true,
   but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement "P(n) is true for all
   n".^[6] Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano
   arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n, far faster than any
   primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for
   example.^[citation needed] The least m for which P(n) holds similarly
   grows extremely quickly with n.

   Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have
   the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of unlabeled rooted trees, where
           each T_i has at most i + n vertices, such that T_i ≤ T_j does not
           hold for any i @lt; j ≤ m.

   It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960,
   tree(4) @gt; Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument
   specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than {\displaystyle
   \mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree}
   ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{8}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7).}

   To differentiate the two functions, "TREE" with all letters capitalized is
   the big TREE function and "tree" with all letters in lowercase is the weak
   tree function.

TREE function[edit]

   Sequence of trees where each node is colored either green, red, blueA
   sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue @lt; red @lt;
   green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no
   tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is
   defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

   By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing
   function.^[7] For a positive integer n, take TREE(n)^[a] to be the largest
   m so that we have the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of rooted trees labelled from a
           set of n labels, where each T_i has at most i vertices, such that
           T_i ≤ T_j does not hold for any i @lt; j ≤ m.

   The TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3)
   explodes to a value that is so big that many other "large" combinatorial
   constants, such as Friedman's n(4), n^n(5)(5), and Graham's number,^[b]
   are extremely small by comparison. A lower bound for n(4), and hence an
   extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is A^A(187196)(1).^[c]^[8]
   Graham's number, for example, is much smaller than the lower bound
   A^A(187196)(1). It is approximately {\displaystyle g_{3\uparrow
   ^{187196}3}}, where g_x is Graham's function.

                              Tree Data Structure                             
                                                                              
   We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and   
   queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The   
   different data structures are used for different kinds of data.            
                                                                              
   Some factors are considered for choosing the data structure:               
                                                                              
     * What type of data needs to be stored?: It might be a possibility that  
       a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data.    
     * Cost of operations: If we want to minimize the cost for the operations 
       for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a   
       simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we 
       can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to    
       perform the binary search. The binary search works very fast for the   
       simple list as it divides the search space into half.                  
     * Memory usage: Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less   
       memory.                                                                
                                                                              
   A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical      
   data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the     
   hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:               
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above tree shows the organization hierarchy of some company. In the    
   above structure, john is the CEO of the company, and John has two direct   
   reports named as Steve and Rohan. Steve has three direct reports named     
   Lee, Bob, Ella where Steve is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named  
   Sal and Emma. Emma has two direct reports named Tom and Raj. Tom has one   
   direct report named Bill. This particular logical structure is known as a  
   Tree. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a Tree. In 
   this structure, the root is at the top, and its branches are moving in a   
   downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is  
   an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.                
                                                                              
   Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.               
                                                                              
     * A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or         
       entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or       
       simulate hierarchy.                                                    
     * A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does   
       not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as    
       elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.                    
     * In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node.  
       Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the      
       above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so   
       the type of data would be a string.                                    
     * Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes  
       that can be called children.                                           
                                                                              
   Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.                              
                                                                              
   Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:                   
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   In the above structure, each node is labeled with some number. Each arrow  
   shown in the above figure is known as a link between the two nodes.        
                                                                              
     * Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In      
       other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In 
       the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If  
       a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a     
       parent-child relationship.                                             
     * Child node: If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is  
       known as a child node.                                                 
     * Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to   
       be the parent of that sub-node.                                        
     * Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.    
     * Leaf Node:- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node,   
       is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the      
       tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. 
       Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.                          
     * Internal nodes: A node has atleast one child node known as an internal 
     * Ancestor node:- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a     
       path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any        
       ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are 
       the ancestors of node 10.                                              
     * Descendant: The immediate successor of the given node is known as a    
       descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of     
       node 5.                                                                
                                                                              
     Properties of Tree data structure                                        
                                                                              
     * Recursive data structure: The tree is also known as a recursive data   
       structure. A tree can be defined as recursively because the            
       distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a root node.   
       The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its      
       subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below   
       figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left      
       subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different    
       colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner.   
       So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented  
       in various applications.                                               
       Tree                                                                   
     * Number of edges: If there are n nodes, then there would n-1 edges.     
       Each arrow in the structure represents the link or path. Each node,    
       except the root node, will have atleast one incoming link known as an  
       edge. There would be one link for the parent-child relationship.       
     * Depth of node x: The depth of node x can be defined as the length of   
       the path from the root to the node x. One edge contributes one-unit    
       length in the path. So, the depth of node x can also be defined as the 
       number of edges between the root node and the node x. The root node    
       has 0 depth.                                                           
     * Height of node x: The height of node x can be defined as the longest   
       path from the node x to the leaf node.                                 
                                                                              
   Based on the properties of the Tree data structure, trees are classified   
   into various categories.                                                   
                                                                              
     Implementation of Tree                                                   
                                                                              
   The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically   
   with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented   
   as shown below:                                                            
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in    
   the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The    
   second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the    
   left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.     
                                                                              
   In programming, the structure of a node can be defined as:                 
                                                                              
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
                                                                              
   The above structure can only be defined for the binary trees because the   
   binary tree can have utmost two children, and generic trees can have more  
   than two children. The structure of the node for generic trees would be    
   different as compared to the binary tree.                                  
                                                                              
     Applications of trees                                                    
                                                                              
   The following are the applications of trees:                               
                                                                              
     * Storing naturally hierarchical data: Trees are used to store the data  
       in the hierarchical structure. For example, the file system. The file  
       system stored on the disc drive, the file and folder are in the form   
       of the naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees.    
     * Organize data: It is used to organize data for efficient insertion,    
       deletion and searching. For example, a binary tree has a logN time for 
       searching an element.                                                  
     * Trie: It is a special kind of tree that is used to store the           
       dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking. 
     * Heap: It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is 
       used to implement priority queues.                                     
     * B-Tree and B+Tree: B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used 
       to implement indexing in databases.                                    
     * Routing table: The tree data structure is also used to store the data  
       in routing tables in the routers.                                      
                                                                              
     Types of Tree data structure                                             
                                                                              
   The following are the types of a tree data structure:                      
                                                                              
     * General tree: The general tree is one of the types of tree data        
       structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n  
       number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the  
       node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node   
       in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent  
       node are known as subtrees.                                            
       Tree                                                                   
       There can be n number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general    
       tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be 
       ordered.                                                               
       Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are          
       connected to the nodes known as child nodes. The root node is labeled  
       with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as         
       siblings.                                                              
     * Binary tree: Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0    
       and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child 
       nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2    
       nodes.                                                                 
       Tree

     * Binary Search tree: Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure  
       in which one node is connected to n number of nodes. It is a           
       node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary       
       search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and        
       right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in  
       a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child    
       and right child pointer).                                              
       Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the      
       value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right        
       subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.                
                                                                              
   A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as   
   struct, as shown below:

   The above is the node structure with three fields: data field, the second  
   field is the left pointer of the node type, and the third field is the     
   right pointer of the node type.

     * AVL tree                                                               
                                                                              
   It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a      
   variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the  
   binary tree as well as of the binary search tree. It is a self-balancing   
   binary search tree that was invented by Adelson Velsky Lindas. Here,       
   self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right  
   subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the balancing factor.      
                                                                              
   We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search  
   tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as 
   the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of    
   the right subtree. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or   
   1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the       
   balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.                                    
                                                                              
   To know more about the AVL tree, click on the link given below:            
                                                                              
   https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree                                        
                                                                              
     * Red-Black Tree                                                         
                                                                              
   The red-Black tree is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the      
   Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a   
   binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the  
   value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater   
   than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary 
   search in the average case is log_2n, the best case is O(1), and the worst 
   case is O(n).                                                              
                                                                              
   When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be        
   balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion,   
   etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time          
   complexity of log_2n.                                                      
                                                                              
   The red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is     
   also a height balancing binary search tree then why do we require a        
   Red-Black tree. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would   
   be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 
   rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that 
   represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing 
   of the tree.                                                               
                                                                              
     * Splay tree                                                             
                                                                              
   The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently 
   accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some 
   rotation operations. Here, splaying means the recently accessed node. It   
   is a self-balancing binary search tree having no explicit balance          
   condition like AVL tree.                                                   
                                                                              
   It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced,   
   i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the           
   operations in splay tree takes order of logN time where n is the number of 
   nodes.                                                                     
                                                                              
   Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height      
   balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which    
   leads to a balanced tree.                                                  
                                                                              
     * Treap                                                                  
                                                                              
   Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it    
   comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary  
   search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the  
   value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or 
   greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both      
   right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we   
   can say that the root node contains the lowest value.                      
                                                                              
   In treap data structure, each node has both key and priority where key is  
   derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap  
   data structure.                                                            
                                                                              
   The Treap data structure follows two properties which are given below:     
                                                                              
     * Right child of a node@gt;=current node and left child of a node @lt;=current 
       node (binary tree)                                                     
     * Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap)           
     * B-tree                                                                 
                                                                              
   B-tree is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree.     
   Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have  
   more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the       
   sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at      
   different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same    
   level.                                                                     
                                                                              
   If order is m then node has the following properties:                      
                                                                              
     * Each node in a b-tree can have maximum m children                      
     * For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has        
       minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2        
       children. For example, the value of m is 5 which means that a node can 
       have 5 children and internal nodes can contain maximum 3 children.     
     * Each node has maximum (m-1) keys.                                      
                                                                              
   The root node must contain minimum 1 key and all other nodes must contain  
   atleast ceiling of m/2 minus 1 keys.

   In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices
   are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
   undirected graph.^[1] A forest is an undirected graph in which any two
   vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic
   undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.^[2]

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented
   forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a
   forest.

   The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer
   science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although
   such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be
   directed, called a directed rooted tree,^[8]^[9] either making all its
   edges point away from the root—in which case it is called an
   arborescence^[4]^[10] or out-tree^[11]^[12]—or making all its edges point
   towards the root—in which case it is called an anti-arborescence^[13] or
   in-tree.^[11]^[14] A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors
   as a directed graph.^[15]^[16]^[17] A rooted forest is a disjoint union of
   rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted
   forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each
   rooted tree—in which case it is called a branching or out-forest—or making
   all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree—in which case it
   is called an anti-branching or in-forest.

   The term tree was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur
   Cayley.^[18]

Definitions[edit]

  Tree[edit]

   A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following
   equivalent conditions:

     * G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
     * G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
     * G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is
       removed from G.
     * G is connected and the complete graph K_3 is not a minor of G.
     * Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.

   If G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements
   are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:

     * G is connected and has n − 1 edges.
     * G is connected, and every subgraph of G includes at least one vertex
       with zero or one incident edges. (That is, G is connected and
       1-degenerate.)
     * G has no simple cycles and has n − 1 edges.

   As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no
   vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously
   connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is
   not 0-connected (or even (−1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike
   non-empty trees, and violates the "one more vertex than edges" relation.
   It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.

   An internal vertex (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2.
   Similarly, an external vertex (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf)
   is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree
   at least 3.^[19]

   An irreducible tree (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is
   no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence A000014 in the OEIS).^[20]

  Forest[edit]

   A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
   at most one path. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected acyclic graph,
   all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph
   consists of a disjoint union of trees. As special cases, the order-zero
   graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless
   graph, are examples of forests. Since for every tree V − E = 1, we can
   easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting
   the difference between total vertices and total edges. TV − TE = number of
   trees in a forest.

  Polytree[edit]

   Main article: Polytree

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed
   edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both
   connected and acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed tree" to the case where
   the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed
   away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).

  Polyforest[edit]

   A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic
   graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest. In other words, if we
   replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected
   graph that is acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed forest" to the case
   where the edges of each connected component are all directed towards a
   particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see
   branching).

  Rooted tree[edit]

   A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the
   root.^[21] The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural
   orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the
   structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has
   an orientation away from the root, it is called an arborescence^[4] or
   out-tree;^[11] when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called
   an anti-arborescence or in-tree.^[11] The tree-order is the partial
   ordering on the vertices of a tree with u @lt; v if and only if the unique
   path from the root to v passes through u. A rooted tree T that is a
   subgraph of some graph G is a normal tree if the ends of every T-path in G
   are comparable in this tree-order (Diestel 2005, p. 15). Rooted trees,
   often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at
   each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data
   structure.

   In a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any
   designated root is called a free tree.

   A labeled tree is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The
   vertices of a labeled tree on n vertices (for nonnegative integers n) are
   typically given the labels 1, 2, …, n. A recursive tree is a labeled
   rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if u @lt; v
   for two vertices u and v, then the label of u is smaller than the label of
   v).

   In a rooted tree, the parent of a vertex v is the vertex connected to v on
   the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root
   has no parent.^[21] A child of a vertex v is a vertex of which v is the
   parent.^[21] An ascendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either the
   parent of v or is (recursively) an ascendant of a parent of v. A
   descendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either a child of v or is
   (recursively) a descendant of a child of v. A sibling to a vertex v is any
   other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with v.^[21] A leaf is a
   vertex with no children.^[21] An internal vertex is a vertex that is not a
   leaf.^[21]

   The height of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest
   downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The height of the tree is the
   height of the root. The depth of a vertex is the length of the path to its
   root (root path). This^[clarification needed (This ___?)] is commonly
   needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees
   in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a
   tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has
   depth^[clarification needed (we've only defined depth of a vertex, not
   also the depth of the tree)] and height zero. Conventionally, an empty
   tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height
   −1.

   A k-ary tree (for nonnegative integers k) is a rooted tree in which each
   vertex has at most k children.^[22] 2-ary trees are often called binary
   trees, while 3-ary trees are sometimes called ternary trees.

  Ordered tree[edit]

   An ordered tree (alternatively, plane tree or positional tree^[23]) is a
   rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each
   vertex.^[21]^[24] This is called a "plane tree" because an ordering of the
   children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the
   root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex.
   Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction
   of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the
   children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing
   the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be
   drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.

Properties[edit]

     * Every tree is a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if
       it contains no cycles of odd length. Since a tree contains no cycles
       at all, it is bipartite.
     * Every tree with only countably many vertices is a planar graph.
     * Every connected graph G admits a spanning tree, which is a tree that
       contains every vertex of G and whose edges are edges of G. More
       specific types spanning trees, existing in every connected finite
       graph, include depth-first search trees and breadth-first search
       trees. Generalizing the existence of depth-first-search trees, every
       connected graph with only countably many vertices has a Trémaux
       tree.^[25] However, some uncountable-order graphs do not have such a
       tree.^[26]
     * Every finite tree with n vertices, with n @gt; 1, has at least two
       terminal vertices (leaves). This minimal number of leaves is
       characteristic of path graphs; the maximal number, n − 1, is attained
       only by star graphs. The number of leaves is at least the maximum
       vertex degree.
     * For any three vertices in a tree, the three paths between them have
       exactly one vertex in common. More generally, a vertex in a graph that
       belongs to three shortest paths among three vertices is called a
       median of these vertices. Because every three vertices in a tree have
       a unique median, every tree is a median graph.
     * Every tree has a center consisting of one vertex or two adjacent
       vertices. The center is the middle vertex or middle two vertices in
       every longest path. Similarly, every n-vertex tree has a centroid
       consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. In the first case
       removal of the vertex splits the tree into subtrees of fewer than n/2
       vertices. In the second case, removal of the edge between the two
       centroidal vertices splits the tree into two subtrees of exactly n/2
       vertices.
     * The maximal cliques of a tree are precisely its edges, implying that
       the class of trees has few cliques.

Enumeration[edit]

  Labeled trees[edit]

   Cayley's formula states that there are n^n−2 trees on n labeled vertices.
   A classic proof uses Prüfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger
   result: the number of trees with vertices 1, 2, …, n of degrees d_1, d_2,
   …, d_n respectively, is the multinomial coefficient

           {\displaystyle {n-2 \choose d_{1}-1,d_{2}-1,\ldots ,d_{n}-1}.}

   A more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph,
   which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem. (Cayley's formula is the
   special case of spanning trees in a complete graph.) The similar problem
   of counting all the subtrees regardless of size is #P-complete in the
   general case (Jerrum (1994)).

  Unlabeled trees[edit]

   Counting the number of unlabeled free trees is a harder problem. No closed
   formula for the number t(n) of trees with n vertices up to graph
   isomorphism is known. The first few values of t(n) are

           1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, …
           (sequence A000055 in the OEIS).

   Otter (1948) proved the asymptotic estimate

           {\displaystyle t(n)\sim C\alpha ^{n}n^{-5/2}\quad {\text{as }}n\to
           \infty ,}

   with C ≈ 0.534949606... and α ≈ 2.95576528565... (sequence A051491 in the
   OEIS). Here, the ~ symbol means that

           {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {t(n)}{C\alpha
           ^{n}n^{-5/2}}}=1.}

   This is a consequence of his asymptotic estimate for the number r(n) of
   unlabeled rooted trees with n vertices:

           r(n) \sim D\alpha^n n^{-3/2} \quad\text{as } n\to\infty,

   with D ≈ 0.43992401257... and the same α as above (cf. Knuth (1997), chap.
   2.3.4.4 and Flajolet @amp; Sedgewick (2009), chap. VII.5, p. 475).

   The first few values of r(n) are^[27]

           1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, 12486, 32973, …
           (sequence A000081 in the OEIS).

Types of trees[edit]

     * A path graph (or linear graph) consists of n vertices arranged in a
       line, so that vertices i and i + 1 are connected by an edge for i = 1,
       …, n – 1.
     * A starlike tree consists of a central vertex called root and several
       path graphs attached to it. More formally, a tree is starlike if it
       has exactly one vertex of degree greater than 2.
     * A star tree is a tree which consists of a single internal vertex (and
       n – 1 leaves). In other words, a star tree of order n is a tree of
       order n with as many leaves as possible.
     * A caterpillar tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance
       1 of a central path subgraph.
     * A lobster tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 2
       of a central path subgraph.
     * A regular tree of degree d is the infinite tree with d edges at each
       vertex. These arise as the Cayley graphs of free groups, and in the
       theory of Tits buildings.

       on pages 20–21. Also in 1847, the German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff
       investigated electrical circuits and found a relation between the
       number (n) of wires/resistors (branches), the number (m) of junctions
       (vertices), and the number (μ) of loops (faces) in the circuit. He

   “Louisiana celebrates Arbor Day each year on the third Friday of January.
   It’s during the cooler months that’s the best time of year to plant a
   tree,” said C.A. “Buck” Vandersteen, executive director of the Louisiana
   Forestry Association. “We’re always happy to see the community come out
   and get a tree. Many plant them with a child or grandchild.”

   ArborGen SuperTree Nursery provides the seedlings each year. Also,
   saplings will be available, complements of Louisiana Forest Seed.

   The Louisiana Forestry Association is a group of 4,000 members that
   includes forest landowners, foresters, loggers and others employed in the
   forest products industry. LFA’s mission is to further the practice of
   sustainable forestry.

   Gulfport bonfire

   St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, hosts a Christmas
   tree bonfire for Epiphany each year on a beach near where the former
   church building stood until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

   [Episcopal News Service] The Christian holy day Epiphany, on Jan. 6, is
   also known as the “Feast of Lights,” and some Episcopal congregations
   celebrate this feast quite literally, by burning Christmas trees and
   greens in recognition of Jesus as a light to the world.

   “If you’ve ever seen Christmas trees burn … they go up in a tremendous
   blaze,” the Rev. Hillary Raining told Episcopal News Service in describing
   the annual Epiphany bonfire at St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in
   Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, where she is rector.

   A similar blaze is planned at All Saints’ Episcopal Church in
   Russellville, Arkansas. The fire, a mix of Christmas trees and ordinary
   firewood, will be followed by a short liturgy and blessing of kits of
   chalk that attendees can use to mark their front doors with the initials
   of the Magi, another beloved Epiphany tradition.

   “It’s something that allows us again to remind folks that the church is in
   the world and not just in the church building,” the Rev. Mercedes
   Clements, rector at All Saints’, told ENS.

   And at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, the
   congregation will continue a local Epiphany tradition dating back more
   than 50 years when it hosts a Christmas tree bonfire on a nearby beach.
   The Epiphany bonfire has taken on greater meaning to the St. Mark’s
   congregation in the years since Hurricane Katrina destroyed the former
   church in 2005.

   “We celebrate in prayers of hope and gratefulness for the New Year, then
   enjoy hot chocolate and the first King Cakes of the year,” the church says
   on its website.

   The light from a Christmas tree fire invokes symbolism partly rooted in
   Epiphany’s origins as an alternative to pagan festivals that were held on
   the winter solstice – the darkest day of the year. Also known as Three
   Kings Day, Epiphany traditionally commemorates the day the Magi were
   introduced to the infant Jesus. Light also is a familiar motif in
   contemporary lectionary readings for Epiphany, such as Isaiah 60:1-6:
   “Arise, shine; for your light has come.”

   Some of the clergy interviewed by ENS emphasized that the purpose is not
   to demonize darkness but to celebrate Jesus’ earthly role.

   “It is not a good-bad binary. Darkness is not the representation of bad or
   evil. It’s just a contrast,” said the Very Rev. Steven Thomason, dean of
   St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, Washington. “The spiritual
   journey includes both, and can honor both.”

   St. Mark’s will hold its Epiphany festivities after sundown Jan. 5,
   starting with Holy Eucharist in the cathedral. Worshippers then will
   proceed out to the parking lot, where Advent wreaths and other Christmas
   greens will be burned in a fire pit. Dozens usually attend, sipping hot
   chocolate and apple cider around a modest blaze.

   “It’s still a nice fire to warm by and to have the brightness of the
   light,” Thomason said. “It’s a great source of joy for folks in the middle
   of winter.”

   At All Saints’, the church in Arkansas, the bonfire is scheduled for the
   evening Jan. 6. Clements will lead an adaptation of Evening Prayer as
   worshipers gather outdoors around the burning trees. The church is located
   on a wooded property, so the congregation will keep the blaze small for
   safety, Clements said, while still “bringing some light into the darkness,
   and reminding us that Jesus does that in our lives.”

   Raining, the rector at St. Christopher’s in suburban Philadelphia, noted
   that Christmas tree burns have ancient roots in Twelfth Night
   celebrations, which marked the end of the Christmas season. And though
   burning trees may not seem like the most environmentally friendly
   practice, Raining said it is preferable to leaving trees on the curb for
   disposal in a landfill. Also, the ashes from the fire will be used to
   fertilize the grounds of the church.

   St. Christopher’s will host its Christmas tree bonfire in the evening Jan.
   7, with the public invited to bring trees and greens from home. Past
   bonfires have been community events, attracting some residents who don’t
   normally attend the church. The church also invites the local fire
   department, both as a safety precaution and so Raining can bless the fire
   truck.

   “We really consider this part of our pastoring the community,” Raining
   said. “There’s something about gathering in what in the Northern
   Hemisphere are the darkest of nights and being able to talk about Jesus.”

   Attendees also are encouraged to identify things they wish to let go of in
   the new year and write them on slips of paper. The slips then are tossed
   into the fire and sent up, like prayers.

                                What is a Tree?

   by Michael Kuhns, Extension Forestry Specialist

   What is a tree? How are trees different from grasses, sunflowers,
   dandelions, and other types of plants? And what do trees have in common
   with shrubs and woody vines? The answers to these questions seem obvious
   at first. But unless you are a botanist you may find that the answers
   don't come easily. Let's look a little closer to find some common
   characteristics of trees, shrubs, and woody vines.

   Trees, shrubs, and vines belong to many different plant families. Some are
   closely related, like ponderosa pine and limber pine. Others are not
   closely related at all, like eastern red cedar and silver maple. However,
   trees, shrubs, and vines all have one thing that separates them from the
   rest of the plant world: a woody stem that is perennial or that lives for
   many years. Grasses and certain other plants may be perennial, but their
   tops are regrown year after year from rhizomes, bulbs, or other organs
   found at or just under the soil surface.

   Let's look at each of the parts of a woody plant's stem and see how they
   are put together and how they grow larger year after year. If you could
   tunnel into a woody plant's stem, whether the trunk of a tree or a twig on
   a shrub, you would first encounter bark, then cambium, and finally wood or
   xylem. Bark is the outer covering on the trunk, twigs, and woody roots.
   The outer bark we are familiar with is a layer of dead corky cells
   protecting the rest of the stem. The inner bark, or phloem, is a live
   spongy layer just inside the outer bark that moves sugars and other
   substances from the leaves to the stem, roots, and other places where they
   are needed. Inner bark eventually grows out to form part of the outer
   bark.

   New bark is constantly being made on the inside and pushed out. This is
   why older trunks usually have rough outer bark that peels or flakes away.
   Bark is highly variable, though. Young trees of most species have fairly
   smooth bark. To see what a tree's bark looked like when it was young, look
   at the young bark on upper branches and twigs.

   White Oak Cross section

   Cross section of white oak tree trunk:

   (A) outer bark (dry dead tissue)
   (B) inner bark (living tissue)
   (C) cambium
   (D) sapwood
   (E) heartwood
   (F) pith
   (G) wood rays.

   Just inside the bark, but outside the wood, is a single layer of cells
   called the cambium. This layer repeatedly divides, first in then out, to
   form all of the new wood and bark. Wood, or xylem, makes up everything
   inside the cambium on tree trunks, branches, twigs, and woody roots. Wood
   is made up of fibers for strength and hollow tubes of different sizes.
   These tubes are like straws that conduct water from the roots to the
   leaves. These tubes and fibers, as well as other types of cells, are
   packed tightly together to make the wood inside a woody plant.

   As woody plants grow in diameter a new layer of wood is produced each year
   by the cambium. This layer is called an annual ring or growth ring. The
   rings in the center of a trunk or twig are the oldest and those near the
   outside are younger. Wide rings usually indicate good growth conditions
   for that year and narrow rings indicate poor growing conditions.

   As a stem ages and grows, eventually some of the wood in the center is not
   needed for water movement. This wood dies one ring at a time and becomes
   heartwood. Heartwood often is filled with dark colored substances that
   help it resist decay, as in red cedar's red to purple heartwood. The
   active living wood on the outside of the stem, one to many rings wide, is
   called the sapwood. It is usually lighter in color than heartwood. Sapwood
   is responsible for all water and mineral movement through the stem.

   Ponderosa PineMost people would agree that this ponderosa pine is a tree,
   but...

   Canyon Maple tree...the canyon maple and Utah junipers in this picture
   might be considered shrubs. Given enough time to grow, all of them should
   meet the definition of a tree.

   So trees, shrubs, and woody vines all have woody, perennial stems. What
   makes them different from one another? The distinction between trees and
   shrubs is not always clear. We all know that a large cottonwood is a tree
   and a creeping juniper is a shrub, but there are many shrub-like trees and
   tree-like shrubs. Though no scientific definition exists to separate trees
   and shrubs, a useful definition for a tree is a woody plant having one
   erect perennial stem (trunk) at least three inches in diameter at a point
   4-1/2 feet above the ground, a definitely formed crown of foliage, and a
   mature height of at least 13 feet. This definition works fine, though some
   trees may have more than one stem and young trees obviously don't meet the
   size criteria. A shrub can then be defined as a woody plant with several
   perennial stems that may be erect or may lay close to the ground. It will
   usually have a height less than 13 feet and stems no more than about three
   inches in diameter.

   Woody vines are plants that have perennial stems that cannot support
   themselves. Vines use other plants or objects to rise above the ground or
   they lie along the ground. Vines attach themselves to other objects with
   tendrils or by twining. Though woody vines have perennial stems, these
   stems rarely get very large in diameter.

   Trees, shrubs, and woody vines can be classified as deciduous or
   evergreen. If a plant's leaves stay green and alive through the winter it
   is called an evergreen. Examples found in Utah are pines, spruces, and
   junipers. Plants whose leaves die in autumn and fall off, such as elms,
   maples, and ashes, are called deciduous. In Utah nearly all evergreen
   woody plants have needle-like or scaly leaves and most deciduous woody
   plants have broad leaves. All vines commonly found in Utah have broad
   leaves and are deciduous.

                                     Gavin Scott, 47, of Colorado Springs
                                     died around noon Tuesday, the Summit
                                     County Coroner’s Office said in an email

            Tree Trimming, Removal Project To Slow Traffic On US 97A

   Motorists in the Chelan area will encounter the unusual sight of orange on
   the roadway in the wintertime next week.

   The Washington State Department of Transportation (DOT) is partnering with
   the Chelan County PUD for a tree thinning and removal project on U.S.
   Highway 97A just west of the Dan Gordon Bridge.

   "We will be providing traffic control for the PUD's arborist team," says
   DOT spokesperson, Lauren Loebsack. "Drivers can expect some traffic delays
   and some intermittent closures of the Riverwalk Trail through that area
   while the work is going on."

   Loebsack adds that while projects involving the DOT are rare during the
   winter months, the one in Chelan is happening at an ideal time of the
   year.

   "Trimming trees in the winter is probably the preferred time when they are
   dormant, and the removal of trees of trees is also better because there
   won't be as much material to clean up since there aren't as many leaves on
   the trees. This work will also be weather dependent, so if it does end up
   raining or snowing that day we're going to need to bump that work down the
   road a bit."

   The project is scheduled to happen on Tuesday, Jan. 9 from 8:30 a.m. to
   3:30 p.m.

 Steve McQueen’s ‘Lynching Tree’ exhibit comes to the Isabella Stewart Gardner

   A docent in the Yale Center for British Art tapped Lee Pelton on the
   shoulder and handed him a box of tissues. The president of The Boston
   Foundation had been moved to tears observing an exhibit titled Lynching
   Tree (2013) by Steve McQueen.

   For several weeks, the experience stayed with Pelton. He wanted to bring
   it to Boston.

   He noted that the title of the exhibit is not “The Lynching Tree”, but
   rather “Lynching Tree" — a symbolic representation of the terror of
   lynching, which claimed the lives of almost 4,500 Black Americans from
   1877-1950 in the years after the Civil War.

   “I was really overcome with grief and a kind of horrific pain," Pelton
   said of the exhibit Tuesday on Boston Public Radio. "What it represented
   for me is the way in which history, particularly of Black Americans, is
   hidden."

   Pelton said he thought the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum was the best
   place to "recreate the experience that I had with its intimacy.”

   Peggy Fogelman, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, agreed.
   Steve McQueen’s "Lynching Tree" will be exhibited at the museum for two
   weeks, from Jan. 20 through Feb. 4, 2024.

   “This is a continuation of the kind of work that the Gardner has been
   doing over the past few years," Fogelman said. "Our exhibitions are built
   on the premise that art has something really important to say about the
   issues that face us today.”

   The museum usually plans out exhibits 3 to 5 years in advance but made an
   exception.

   “We could wait five years and give it the normal exhibition full run,
   which is three months, or we could do it now and have a shorter run. And
   it seemed to both of us really important to do it now,” Fogelman said.

   The timing of the exhibit also coincides with the ten-year anniversary of
   McQueen's Academy Award for "12 Years a Slave" and the 50th anniversary of
   the desegregation crisis in Boston schools. It also marks the second time
   the photograph will be displayed in an American museum, following its
   initial showcase at Yale.

   Steve McQueen's preference for displaying Lynching Tree on its own will be
   honored by its placement in the Fenway Gallery. Both Pelton and Fogelman
   said they are eager to witness Boston's response to the exhibit,
   anticipating not only a deep emotional response from visitors but also a
   collective confrontation with the "ugly and horrific truths" the work
   represents.

   “That's the only way we can move forward,” Fogelman said.

   Microsoft Start’s personalized content feed makes it easy to catch up on
   the things you care about, from news and traffic to sports, entertainment,
   hobbies and weather. Now, on the heels of Earth Day this year, Microsoft
   Start is also helping you give back to the planet. By using Weather from
   Microsoft Start, you can help contribute to a greener, more sustainable
   Earth by growing an E-tree!

   Weather from Microsoft Start offers hyper-local, up-to-the-minute
   forecasts and interactive maps with beautiful animations and visuals – all
   to keep you constantly informed about the weather where it matters to you
   most. With a tool this powerful, the challenge is helping people discover
   all the information available to them – to help, we launched “E-trees.”  

   This fun, guided, interactive experience is designed to reward users for
   engaging with different parts of Weather from Microsoft Start. Once you
   join, users will earn points through simple daily tasks – things like
   checking precipitation, temperature, or wind in your area. Progress is
   easy to track as you earn points and grow your very own E-tree! 

   As your E-tree grows, Microsoft will work to turn it into a real tree. To
   make this happen, we’ve partnered with the Eden Restoration Projects, a
   non-profit committed to restoring forests and protecting ecosystems in
   high-risk or unstable areas. 

   It only takes a few easy steps to get started and plant your E-tree – just
   launch Weather from the Windows 10 or Windows 11 taskbar, from the Weather
   card on the feed in a new tab in Edge, or by heading to
   MicrosoftStart.com. On the Weather page, you’ll find the seed on the left
   where you’ll be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft Account and then
   click “Join now.”

   Once you sign in and join, you’ll be able to give your E-tree a unique
   name. Then, you can start nurturing your tree by collecting energy points
   right away. Each time you launch Weather and click on your tree, you’ll
   see suggested tasks and new ways to get points daily while learning more
   about the weather where you live or in another area you care about – like
   seeing how much rain to expect where you’re going on vacation next or
   keeping track of extreme weather somewhere you have family or friends.

   Just like a real tree, an E-tree needs water, air, and sunlight.
   Conveniently, Weather from Microsoft Start can deliver meaningful
   information about each of these. The site includes detailed maps with
   beautiful animations showing wind, heat – or a Redmond favorite – the
   precipitation map. The hourly forecast animation helps to plan the best
   time for walking the dog, riding a bike, or even taking a quick “sun
   break” to make the most of the sunshine. 

   Once your tree reaches 10,000 points, you’ll receive an E-tree certificate
   and the Eden Restoration Projects will plant a real tree in the Mwamdudu
   site, just outside the bustling city of Mombasa, Kenya. You can even see
   how fast other people are their E-trees!

   E-Trees bring together the best weather tools with a fun experience, plus
   the chance to make the world a greener place – one tree at a time.

      What's the oldest tree on Earth—and will it survive climate change?

   Bristlecone pines in the western U.S. have been alive for nearly 5,000
   years, but an upstart Patagonian cypress challenges that record.

   This 1,400-year-old bristlecone pine on Mount Washington in Nevada’s Great
   Basin National Park is so iconic its image is stamped on the back of some
   U.S. quarters. For decades, bristlecone pines, which can survive for up to
   5,000 years, were thought to be the planet’s oldest living things. Now a
   tree in Chile is posing a challenge.

   Great Basin National ParkThousands of feet above the Nevada desert, in a
   part of Great Basin National Park that tourists rarely see, park ecologist
   Gretchen Baker neared the top of Mount Washington and raised her
   binoculars. There just below, sprouting directly from the limestone, grew
   some of the oldest living things on Earth.

   Great Basin bristlecone pines, their dense pale trunks twisted like thick
   rope by centuries of gusting wind and rain, thrive here in part because so
   little else does. At altitudes near 11,000 feet along Nevada’s rocky Snake
    Range there are no grasses, no brush, few pests, no competition. No
   people to start wildfires. No nearby trees to spread pathogens.

   With nothing around to kill them, these ancient beasts are left alone year
   after year to simply do what they do: store water in needles that can live
   for decades and pack on the teensiest bit of heft at a time. The wood
   grows so slowly it gets too dense for beetles or disease to penetrate.

   Left: This young bristlecone pine was spared during the Phillips Ranch
   Fire in 2000, which killed thousands of others. One reason bristlecones
   live so long is that they grow in relative isolation, so fires rarely
   spread through their groves. But as fires grow bigger and more intense
   with climate change, the infernos pose a greater threat to these
   long-lived trees. 
   Right: Bristlecones grow slowly, which makes their sculpted wood difficult
   for pathogens and insects to penetrate, helping them live long lives.
   Their annual growth rings hold information about climate variability
   dating back thousands of years and are a valuable resource for
   scientists. 
   Another strategy that keeps bristlecone pines going is “strip barking.”
   Even when sections of the tree die, the rest may live on as narrow bands
   of living tissue and bark connect roots to high branches. In some cases 95
   percent of the tree may be dead, while this small portion lives on.

   Some individual bristlecones have survived this way since before the
   pyramids were erected at Giza. That includes Methuselah, in California’s
   White Mountains, the oldest documented living bristlecone, which, based on
   tree-ring data, is 4,853 years old.

   Scientists have long believed that makes this tree the planet’s oldest
   single living thing. But that argument grew more complicated this month
   after a Chilean researcher used unusual techniques to date a tree of a
   different species, a Patagonian cypress. If correct, his work would make
   that South American conifer the newest oldest thing.

   The claim has tree researchers abuzz but skeptical, at least in part
   because the cypress, growing in a temperate rainforest, appears to live
   such a different life than a bristlecone. Despite their longevity both the
   bristlecones and the interloper are now facing questions about how well
   they’ll navigate the coming decades.

An old rival

   Patagonian cypresses, also known as alerces, are native to Chile and
   Argentina and have long been recognized as the world’s second
   longest-lived tree species. The previous record-setting alerce was
   identified in the early 1990s by counting tree rings on a cut stump; it
   was more than 3,600 years old. (The oldest known giant sequoia, the third
   longest-lived species, was identified the same way and lived to 3,266.)

   But earlier this month, a story in Science by Gabriel Popkin revealed that
   environmental scientist Jonathan Barichivich and the researcher who first
   identified that old alerce had been studying another tree in a Chilean
   national park. The researchers used a T-shaped increment borer to drill in
   and remove a core sample from the moss-draped cypress. The boring device
   couldn’t reach the center of the tree, which is more than a dozen feet in
   diameter. But by combining their core sample with tree-ring information
   from other alerces, and using computer modeling, the pair estimated the
   tree was roughly 5,400 years old, with an 80 percent chance it was more
   than 5,000 years old.

   By combining a partial core sample with computer modeling, researchers in
   South America believe they can show that this Patagonian cypress tree,
   also called an alerce, towering out of a ravine in Chile, is at least
   5,000 years old, which would make it Earth’s oldest living tree. Some
   experts are skeptical.

   The research has not been peer-reviewed yet, but Barichivich has shared
   his findings at conferences. Nate Stephenson, an emeritus scientist with
   the U.S. Geological Survey, who has studied giant sequoias for four
   decades, finds the results interesting, but is withholding judgment until
   Barichivich publishes a paper detailing his methods. Still, “the prospect
   is certainly exciting,” Stephenson tells Popkin.

   Others, though, are quite skeptical. Peter Brown, founder of Rocky
   Mountain Tree Ring Research, which gathers information on the world’s
   oldest trees, says Barichivich’s approach is too novel to make such a bold
   claim before publication. “There are many assumptions necessary for
   extrapolating total age from that,” Brown says.

   Brown doesn’t doubt the tree is significant. The partial core alone seems
   to show the tree was at least 2,400 years old, which would put it among
   the top 10 oldest trees on Brown’s list. But Brown has other reasons to be
   suspicious. For example, “this new estimated age is over 1,500 years older
   than the oldest known (alerce) tree to date,” Brown says.

   Brown also sees significant differences between the types of environments
   that tend to support the very oldest trees and the surroundings of the
   Patagonian cypress. In an isolated, austere landscape, like the snowy,
   rocky homes of slow-growing bristlecone, trees can just keep on going.
   Mossy rainforests, on the other hand, are full of life—and threats.

   Scientists still argue about why some trees are able to live so long. “My
   contention is that trees don’t necessarily die from old age like mammals,”
   Brown says. “Something has to come along and kill them.”

   Barichivich understands the skepticism. He says his colleague has found
   another alerce stump whose tree rings can all be counted and show it to be
   about 4,100 years old. (That data is also not yet published.) He also
   argues that tree-ring data suggests alerce actually grow more slowly than
   bristlecones, meaning their wood is also very dense.

   And as part of a recent research team that analyzed the relationship
   between the world’s longest-lived trees and climate, Barichivich believes
   the two species’ worlds are similar in the most important ways. The
   Chilean Coast Range is nothing like the American West, he says, “but there
   are special conditions here, too.”

   His ancient alerce grows on a cloudy south-facing slope, where the annual
   mean temperature is roughly 45 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s found in a ravine,
   protected from fire and until recently from humans. Barichivich says his
   own Chilean grandfather, who worked as a ranger in the park, discovered
   the tree in the early 1970s and may well have been the first person to
   touch it.

   Bristlecones live in harsh environments, often sprouting out of dry, rocky
   soils above 11,000 feet where little else can survive. Pummeled by
   relentless winds, they curl and bend and don’t reach great heights, but
   their diameter may continue to expand for centuries.

A common threat

   Regardless of which species turns out to be the longevity champ, those who
   study the world’s oldest trees are united by a common concern for how
   their favorite species will make it through rough times ahead.

   Wildfires worsened by our fossil fuel emissions have wiped out up to 19
   percent of California’s giant sequoias in just the last two years.

   (Read about how forests are reeling from climate change—but the future
   isn’t lost.)

   While the location of the very oldest bristlecones are kept secret,
   Barichivich’s Chilean tree now draws lots of tourists, who stomp around
   its base, potentially damaging roots. Climate change is also drying out
   the region, which could threaten the tree’s water uptake.

   Bristlecones, too, are seeing a changing world. On a cloudless day last
   July, Gretchen Baker’s pickup lurched up a gravel road so steep it felt at
   times like it might tumble off the mountain. Anna Schoettle, a plant
   ecophysiologist with the U.S. Forest Service, bounced around in the back
   seat. They were here to explain how the ancient pines might weather rising
   temperatures.

   The oldest living sequoias were seedlings more than 3,200 years ago,
   around the time of the Trojan War. Back then, the oldest bristlecones
   living today would already have been around for 1,600 years.

   One reason for that is the bristlecone’s capacity to handle stress. As
   soil erosion or root decay and age weaken a bristlecone’s trunk or
   branches, the entire tree does not die—only the portion under direct
   stress. Instead, these majestic beings practice “strip barking,” allowing
   thin bands of living tissue beneath the bark to curl up the tree
   delivering water from healthy roots. On some bristlecones, as little as 5
   percent of what you see may still, in fact, be alive.

   “You won’t usually see a super old tree that has bark all the way around
   it,” Baker says. “It’s just got this one little living part. Whole
   portions of the tree are now just really artistic-looking dead wood.”

   Bristlecones live across a broad altitude range, from about 6,500 feet up
   to more than 11,000 feet. They have survived all kinds of conditions. The
   trees are typically spaced far enough apart that even the occasional
   lightning-sparked fire rarely spreads beyond a few acres.

   But as we rounded a corner in Baker’s truck, an image of the planet’s new
   reality came into focus. We rolled by acre upon acre of burned husks. A
   hotter, bigger, more powerful fire, fueled in part by a changing climate,
   had blown through in the last few decades, wiping out many bristlecones.

   Warming temperatures, drought, and more explosive fire pose new threats to
   these ancient trees, but mostly at the lower end of their range.
   Bristlecones are also susceptible to blister rust, an imported fungus that
   has killed millions of related trees, including whitebark pines in
   Yellowstone National Park. So far it has not appeared in the wild in Great
   Basin bristlecones.

   “Blister rust is a threat, absolutely,” says Stanley Kitchen, an emeritus
   research scientist with the Forest Service. “How big of a threat is
   something I don’t know. That’s a big question mark for me.”

   Baker, Schoettle, and Kitchen worry that bristlecones at that lower edge
   of their elevation range are likely to have a rough time in coming years.

   But “I don’t worry about the direct effects of climate change on the upper
   half, where it’s most at home,” Kitchen says. “It would take, I think,
   even more climate change than is projected to make them disappear.”

             Everything you need to know about tree data structures

   TK TK
   Everything you need to know about tree data structures

   When you first learn to code, it’s common to learn arrays as the “main
   data structure.”

   Eventually, you will learn about hash tables too. If you are pursuing a
   Computer Science degree, you have to take a class on data structure. You
   will also learn about linked lists, queues, and stacks. Those data
   structures are called “linear” data structures because they all have a
   logical start and a logical end.

   When we start learning about trees and graphs, it can get really
   confusing. We don’t store data in a linear way. Both data structures store
   data in a specific way.

   This post is to help you better understand the Tree Data Structure and to
   clarify any confusion you may have about it.

   In this article, we will learn:

     * What is a tree
     * Examples of trees
     * Its terminology and how it works
     * How to implement tree structures in code.

   Let’s start this learning journey. :)

  Definition

   When starting out programming, it is common to understand better the
   linear data structures than data structures like trees and graphs.

   Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They don’t store data
   in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically.

  Let’s dive into real life examples!

   What do I mean when I say in a hierarchical way?

   Imagine a family tree with relationships from all generation:
   grandparents, parents, children, siblings, etc. We commonly organize
   family trees hierarchically.

   1*MasdC5DmucEU2abIXQe45QMy family tree

   The above drawing is is my family tree. Tossico, Akikazu, Hitomi, and
   Takemi are my grandparents.

   Toshiaki and Juliana are my parents.

   TK, Yuji, Bruno, and Kaio are the children of my parents (me and my
   brothers).

   An organization’s structure is another example of a hierarchy.

   1*GsBCmW5E1GuJ3MpH3Zz0EwA company’s structure is an example of a hierarchy

   In HTML, the Document Object Model (DOM) works as a tree.

   1*dLXUdR4NuIZG8GJdu_CinwDocument Object Model (DOM)

   The HTML tag contains other tags. We have a head tag and a body tag. Those
   tags contains specific elements. The head tag has meta and title tags. The
   body tag has elements that show in the user interface, for example, h1, a,
   li, etc.

  A technical definition

   A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by
   edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a
   child node .

   1*3WN7tIQ-kNBQmY9MgvTuOA

   The first node of the tree is called the root. If this root node is
   connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the
   connected node is a child.

   1*9AtR3bhhlMJxQlaUVEQgrw

   All Tree nodes are connected by links called edges. It’s an important part
   of trees, because it’s manages the relationship between nodes.

   1*j5qKwIxKcEjoxy88EOc1Rg

   Leaves are the last nodes on a tree. They are nodes without children. Like
   real trees, we have the root, branches, and finally the leaves.

   1*c9_5uMUsIy4Q3OA7Q8bJiw

   Other important concepts to understand are height and depth.

   The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf.

   The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root.

  Terminology summary

     * Root is the topmost node of the tree
     * Edge is the link between two nodes
     * Child is a node that has a parent node
     * Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
     * Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
     * Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
     * Depth is the length of the path to its root

  Binary trees

   Now we will discuss a specific type of tree. We call it thebinary tree.

     “In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which
     each node has at the most two children, which are referred to as the
     left child and the right child.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s look at an example of a binary tree.

   1*ofbwuz4inpf2OlB-l9gtHw

  Let’s code a binary tree

   The first thing we need to keep in mind when we implement a binary tree is
   that it is a collection of nodes. Each node has three attributes: value,
   left_child, and right_child.

   How do we implement a simple binary tree that initializes with these three
   properties?

   Let’s take a look.

 class BinaryTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

   Here it is. Our binary tree class.

   When we instantiate an object, we pass the value (the data of the node) as
   a parameter. Look at the left_child and the right_child. Both are set to
   None.

   Why?

   Because when we create our node, it doesn’t have any children. We just
   have the node data.

   Let’s test it:

 tree = BinaryTree('a')
 print(tree.value) # a
 print(tree.left_child) # None
 print(tree.right_child) # None

   That’s it.

   We can pass the string ‘a’ as the value to our Binary Tree node. If we
   print the value, left_child, and right_child, we can see the values.

   Let’s go to the insertion part. What do we need to do here?

   We will implement a method to insert a new node to the right and to the
   left.

   Here are the rules:

     * If the current node doesn’t have a left child, we just create a new
       nodeand set it to the current node’s left_child.
     * If it does have the left child, we create a new node and put it in the
       current left child’s place. Allocate this left child node to the new
       node’s left child.

   Let’s draw it out. :)

   1*ofbwuz4inpf2OlB-l9gtHw

   Here’s the code:

 def insert_left(self, value):
     if self.left_child == None:
         self.left_child = BinaryTree(value)
     else:
         new_node = BinaryTree(value)
         new_node.left_child = self.left_child
         self.left_child = new_node

   Again, if the current node doesn’t have a left child, we just create a new
   node and set it to the current node’s left_child. Or else we create a new
   node and put it in the current left child’s place. Allocate this left
   child node to the new node’s left child.

   And we do the same thing to insert a right child node.

 def insert_right(self, value):
     if self.right_child == None:
         self.right_child = BinaryTree(value)
     else:
         new_node = BinaryTree(value)
         new_node.right_child = self.right_child
         self.right_child = new_node

   Done. :)

   But not entirely. We still need to test it.

   Let’s build the followingtree:

   1*V_EUgNXVc8Wy9H1-JoqT3g

   To summarize the illustration of this tree:

     * a node will be the root of our binary Tree
     * a left child is b node
     * a right child is c node
     * b right child is d node (b node doesn’t have a left child)
     * c left child is e node
     * c right child is f node
     * both e and f nodes do not have children

   So here is the code for the tree:

 a_node = BinaryTree('a')
 a_node.insert_left('b')
 a_node.insert_right('c')

 b_node = a_node.left_child
 b_node.insert_right('d')

 c_node = a_node.right_child
 c_node.insert_left('e')
 c_node.insert_right('f')

 d_node = b_node.right_child
 e_node = c_node.left_child
 f_node = c_node.right_child

 print(a_node.value) # a
 print(b_node.value) # b
 print(c_node.value) # c
 print(d_node.value) # d
 print(e_node.value) # e
 print(f_node.value) # f

   Insertion is done.

   Now we have to think about tree traversal.

   We have two options here: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First
   Search (BFS).

     * DFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each
       branch before backtracking.” — Wikipedia
     * BFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes first,
       before moving to the next level neighbors.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s dive into each tree traversal type.

    Depth-First Search (DFS)

   DFS explores a path all the way to a leaf before backtracking and
   exploring another path. Let’s take a look at an example with this type of
   traversal.

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result for this algorithm will be 1–2–3–4–5–6–7.

   Why?

   Let’s break it down.

    1. Start at the root (1). Print it.

   2. Go to the left child (2). Print it.

   3. Then go to the left child (3). Print it. (This node doesn’t have any
   children)

   4. Backtrack and go the right child (4). Print it. (This node doesn’t have
   any children)

   5. Backtrack to the root node and go to the right child (5). Print it.

   6. Go to the left child (6). Print it. (This node doesn’t have any
   children)

   7. Backtrack and go to the right child (7). Print it. (This node doesn’t
   have any children)

   8. Done.

   When we go deep to the leaf and backtrack, this is called DFS algorithm.

   Now that we are familiar with this traversal algorithm, we will discuss
   types of DFS: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

    Pre-order

   This is exactly what we did in the above example.

    1. Print the value of the node.
    2. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    3. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.

 def pre_order(self):
     print(self.value)

     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.pre_order()

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.pre_order()

    In-order

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result of the in-order algorithm for this tree example is
   3–2–4–1–6–5–7.

   The left first, the middle second, and the right last.

   Now let’s code it.

 def in_order(self):
     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.in_order()

     print(self.value)

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.in_order()

    1. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    2. Print the node’s value
    3. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.

    Post-order

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result of the post order algorithm for this tree example is
   3–4–2–6–7–5–1.

   The left first, the right second, and the middle last.

   Let’s code this.

 def post_order(self):
     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.post_order()

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.post_order()

     print(self.value)

    1. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    2. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.
    3. Print the node’s value

    Breadth-First Search (BFS)

   BFS algorithm traverses the tree level by level and depth by depth.

   1*ZNxp_NkRZLCeak85rreebA

   Here is an example that helps to better explain this algorithm:

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   So we traverse level by level. In this example, the result is
   1–2–5–3–4–6–7.

     * Level/Depth 0: only node with value 1
     * Level/Depth 1: nodes with values 2 and 5
     * Level/Depth 2: nodes with values 3, 4, 6, and 7

   Now let’s code it.

 def bfs(self):
     queue = Queue()
     queue.put(self)

     while not queue.empty():
         current_node = queue.get()
         print(current_node.value)

         if current_node.left_child:
             queue.put(current_node.left_child)

         if current_node.right_child:
             queue.put(current_node.right_child)

   To implement a BFS algorithm, we use the queue data structure to help.

   How does it work?

   Here’s the explanation.

   1*A4yGfEoiqcZ-COvAfr2CWQ
    1. First add the root node into the queue with the put method.
    2. Iterate while the queue is not empty.
    3. Get the first node in the queue, and then print its value.
    4. Add both left and right children into the queue (if the current
       nodehas children).
    5. Done. We will print the value of each node, level by level, with our
       queuehelper.

  Binary Search tree

     “A Binary Search Tree is sometimes called ordered or sorted binary
     trees, and it keeps its values in sorted order, so that lookup and other
     operations can use the principle of binary search” — Wikipedia

   An important property of a Binary Search Tree is that the value of a
   Binary Search Tree nodeis larger than the value of the offspring of its
   left child, but smaller than the value of the offspring of its right
   child.”

   1*mslH9VtVUN9Hs983XxUN5A

   Here is a breakdown of the above illustration:

     * A is inverted. The subtree 7–5–8–6 needs to be on the right side, and
       the subtree 2–1–3 needs to be on the left.
     * B is the only correct option. It satisfies the Binary Search Tree
       property.
     * C has one problem: the node with the value 4. It needs to be on the
       left side of the root because it is smaller than 5.

  Let’s code a Binary Search Tree!

   Now it’s time to code!

   What will we see here? We will insert new nodes, search for a value,
   delete nodes, and the balance of the tree.

   Let’s start.

    Insertion: adding new nodes to our tree

   Imagine that we have an empty tree and we want to add new nodes with the
   following values in this order: 50, 76, 21, 4, 32, 100, 64, 52.

   The first thing we need to know is if 50 is the root of our tree.

   1*fxSlTwgQSN_DlzfEmcxqQg

   We can now start inserting node by node.

     * 76 is greater than 50, so insert 76 on the right side.
     * 21 is smaller than 50, so insert 21 on the left side.
     * 4 is smaller than 50. Node with value 50 has a left child 21. Since 4
       is smaller than 21, insert it on the left side of this node.
     * 32 is smaller than 50. Node with value 50 has a left child 21. Since
       32 is greater than 21, insert 32 on the right side of this node.
     * 100 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       100 is greater than 76, insert 100 on the right side of this node.
     * 64 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       64 is smaller than 76, insert 64 on the left side of this node.
     * 52 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       52 is smaller than 76, node with value 76 has a left child 64. 52 is
       smaller than 64, so insert 54 on the left side of this node.
   1*LlLDNx7wgJfH6VAGnyAbIQ

   Do you notice a pattern here?

   Let’s break it down.

    1. Is the new node value greater or smaller than the current node?
    2. If the value of the new node is greater than the current node, go to
       the right subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a right child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    3. If the value of the new node is smaller than the current node, go to
       the left subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a left child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    4. We did not handle special cases here. When the value of a new node is
       equal to the current value of the node, use rule number 3. Consider
       inserting equal values to the left side of the subtree.

   Now let’s code it.

 class BinarySearchTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

     def insert_node(self, value):
         if value @lt;= self.value and self.left_child:
             self.left_child.insert_node(value)
         elif value @lt;= self.value:
             self.left_child = BinarySearchTree(value)
         elif value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
             self.right_child.insert_node(value)
         else:
             self.right_child = BinarySearchTree(value)

   It seems very simple.

   The powerful part of this algorithm is the recursion part, which is on
   line 9 and line 13. Both lines of code call the insert_node method, and
   use it for its left and right children, respectively. Lines 11 and 15 are
   the ones that do the insertion for each child.

    Let’s search for the node value… Or not…

   The algorithm that we will build now is about doing searches. For a given
   value (integer number), we will say if our Binary Search Tree does or does
   not have that value.

   An important item to note is how we defined the tree insertion algorithm.
   First we have our root node. All the left subtree nodes will have smaller
   values than the root node. And all the right subtree nodes will have
   values greater than the root node.

   Let’s take a look at an example.

   Imagine that we have this tree.

   1*LlLDNx7wgJfH6VAGnyAbIQ

   Now we want to know if we have a node based on value 52.

   1*NwvTrpKiJWb1u2yAY-nnAA

   Let’s break it down.

    1. We start with the root node as our current node. Is the given value
       smaller than the current node value? If yes, then we will search for
       it on the left subtree.
    2. Is the given value greater than the current node value? If yes, then
       we will search for it on the right subtree.
    3. If rules #1 and #2 are both false, we can compare the current node
       value and the given value if they are equal. If the comparison returns
       true, then we can say, “Yeah! Our tree has the given value,”
       otherwise, we say, “Nooo, it hasn’t.”

   Now let’s code it.

 class BinarySearchTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

     def find_node(self, value):
         if value @lt; self.value and self.left_child:
             return self.left_child.find_node(value)
         if value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
             return self.right_child.find_node(value)

         return value == self.value

   Let’s beak down the code:

     * Lines 8 and 9 fall under rule #1.
     * Lines 10 and 11 fall under rule #2.
     * Line 13 falls under rule #3.

   How do we test it?

   Let’s create our Binary Search Tree by initializing the root node with the
   value 15.

 bst = BinarySearchTree(15)

   And now we will insert many new nodes.

 bst.insert_node(10)
 bst.insert_node(8)
 bst.insert_node(12)
 bst.insert_node(20)
 bst.insert_node(17)
 bst.insert_node(25)
 bst.insert_node(19)

   For each inserted node , we will test if our find_node method really
   works.

 print(bst.find_node(15)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(10)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(8)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(12)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(20)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(17)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(25)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(19)) # True

   Yeah, it works for these given values! Let’s test for a value that doesn’t
   exist in our Binary Search Tree.

 print(bst.find_node(0)) # False

   Oh yeah.

   Our search is done.

    Deletion: removing and organizing

   Deletion is a more complex algorithm because we need to handle different
   cases. For a given value, we need to remove the node with this value.
   Imagine the following scenarios for this node : it has no children, has a
   single child, or has two children.

     * Scenario #1: A node with no children (leaf node).

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 20) ---@gt;   |30|   |70|
 #   /    \                                \
 # |20|   |40|                             |40|

   If the node we want to delete has no children, we simply delete it. The
   algorithm doesn’t need to reorganize the tree.

     * Scenario #2: A node with just one child (left or right child).

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 30) ---@gt;   |20|   |70|
 #   /           
 # |20|

   In this case, our algorithm needs to make the parent of the node point to
   the child node. If the node is the left child, we make the parent of the
   left child point to the child. If the node is the right child of its
   parent, we make the parent of the right child point to the child.

     * Scenario #3: A node with two children.

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 30) ---@gt;   |40|   |70|
 #   /    \                             /
 # |20|   |40|                        |20|

   When the node has 2 children, we need to find the node with the minimum
   value, starting from the node’sright child. We will put this node with
   minimum value in the place of the node we want to remove.

   It’s time to code.

 def remove_node(self, value, parent):
     if value @lt; self.value and self.left_child:
         return self.left_child.remove_node(value, self)
     elif value @lt; self.value:
         return False
     elif value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
         return self.right_child.remove_node(value, self)
     elif value @gt; self.value:
         return False
     else:
         if self.left_child is None and self.right_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = None
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child is None and self.right_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = None
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child and self.right_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = self.left_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child and self.right_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = self.left_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.right_child and self.left_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = self.right_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.right_child and self.left_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = self.right_child
             self.clear_node()
         else:
             self.value = self.right_child.find_minimum_value()
             self.right_child.remove_node(self.value, self)

         return True

    1. First: Note the parameters value and parent. We want to find the
       nodethat has this value , and the node’s parent is important to the
       removal of the node.
    2. Second: Note the returning value. Our algorithm will return a boolean
       value. It returns True if it finds the node and removes it. Otherwise
       it will return False.
    3. From line 2 to line 9: We start searching for the node that has the
       valuethat we are looking for. If the value is smaller than the current
       nodevalue , we go to the left subtree, recursively (if, and only if,
       the current node has a left child). If the value is greater, go to the
       right subtree, recursively.
    4. Line 10: We start to think about the remove algorithm.
    5. From line 11 to line 13: We cover the node with no children , and it
       is the left child from its parent. We remove the node by setting the
       parent’s left child to None.
    6. Lines 14 and 15: We cover the node with no children , and it is the
       right child from it’s parent. We remove the node by setting the
       parent’s right child to None.
    7. Clear node method: I will show the clear_node code below. It sets the
       nodes left child , right child, and its value to None.
    8. From line 16 to line 18: We cover the node with just one child (left
       child), and it is the left child from it’s parent. We set the parent's
       left child to the node’s left child (the only child it has).
    9. From line 19 to line 21: We cover the node with just one child (left
       child), and it is the right child from its parent. We set the parent's
       right child to the node’s left child (the only child it has).
   10. From line 22 to line 24: We cover the node with just one child (right
       child), and it is the left child from its parent. We set the parent's
       left child to the node’s right child (the only child it has).
   11. From line 25 to line 27: We cover the node with just one child (right
       child) , and it is the right child from its parent. We set the
       parent's right child to the node’s right child (the only child it
       has).
   12. From line 28 to line 30: We cover the node with both left and
       rightchildren. We get the node with the smallest value (the code is
       shown below) and set it to the value of the current node . Finish it
       by removing the smallest node.
   13. Line 32: If we find the node we are looking for, it needs to return
       True. From line 11 to line 31, we handle this case. So just return
       True and that’s it.
     * To use the clear_node method: set the None value to all three
       attributes — (value, left_child, and right_child)

 def clear_node(self):
     self.value = None
     self.left_child = None
     self.right_child = None

     * To use the find_minimum_value method: go way down to the left. If we
       can’t find anymore nodes, we found the smallest one.

 def find_minimum_value(self):
     if self.left_child:
         return self.left_child.find_minimum_value()
     else:
         return self.value

   Now let’s test it.

   We will use this tree to test our remove_node algorithm.

 #        |15|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #   /    \    /    \
 # |8|   |12| |17| |25|
 #              \
 #              |19|

   Let’s remove the node with the value 8. It’s a node with no child.

 print(bst.remove_node(8, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #     |15|
 #   /      \
 # |10|     |20|
 #    \    /    \
 #   |12| |17| |25|
 #          \
 #          |19|

   Now let’s remove the node with the value 17. It’s a node with just one
   child.

 print(bst.remove_node(17, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #        |15|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #       \    /    \
 #      |12| |19| |25|

   Finally, we will remove a node with two children. This is the root of our
   tree.

 print(bst.remove_node(15, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #        |19|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #        \        \
 #        |12|     |25|

   The tests are now done. :)

  That’s all for now!

   We learned a lot here.

   What a phylogenetic tree is. How to read phylogenetic trees and determine
   which species are most related.

Key points:

     * A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that represents evolutionary
       relationships among organisms. Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, not
       definitive facts.
     * The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species
       or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors.
     * In trees, two species are more related if they have a more recent
       common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common
       ancestor.
     * Phylogenetic trees can be drawn in various equivalent styles. Rotating
       a tree about its branch points doesn't change the information it
       carries.

Introduction

   Humans as a group are big on organizing things. Not necessarily things
   like closets or rooms; I personally score low on the organization front
   for both of those things. Instead, people often like to group and order
   the things they see in the world around them. Starting with the Greek
   philosopher Aristotle, this desire to classify has extended to the many
   and diverse living things of Earth.
   Most modern systems of classification are based on evolutionary
   relationships among organisms – that is, on the organisms’ phylogeny.
   Classification systems based on phylogeny organize species or other groups
   in ways that reflect our understanding of how they evolved from their
   common ancestors.
   In this article, we'll take a look at phylogenetic trees, diagrams that
   represent evolutionary relationships among organisms. We'll see exactly
   what we can (and can't!) infer from a phylogenetic tree, as well as what
   it means for organisms to be more or less related in the context of these
   trees.

Anatomy of a phylogenetic tree

   When we draw a phylogenetic tree, we are representing our best hypothesis
   about how a set of species (or other groups) evolved from a common
   ancestor1‍ . As we'll explore further in the article on building trees,
   this hypothesis is based on information we’ve collected about our set of
   species – things like their physical features and the DNA sequences of
   their genes.
   [Are phylogenetic trees only for species?]
   In a phylogenetic tree, the species or groups of interest are found at the
   tips of lines referred to as the tree's branches. For example, the
   phylogenetic tree below represents relationships between five species, A,
   B, C, D, and E, which are positioned at the ends of the branches:
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The pattern in which the branches connect represents our understanding of
   how the species in the tree evolved from a series of common ancestors.
   Each branch point (also called an internal node) represents a divergence
   event, or splitting apart of a single group into two descendant groups.
   At each branch point lies the most recent common ancestor of all the
   groups descended from that branch point. For instance, at the branch point
   giving rise to species A and B, we would find the most recent common
   ancestor of those two species. At the branch point right above the root of
   the tree, we would find the most recent common ancestor of all the species
   in the tree (A, B, C, D, E).
   [Why is this the most recent common ancestor of all the species?]
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, labeled root, which branches (at a branch point) to form species
   E and another line that branches into a pair of double branches. From
   there, the first pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the
   second pair of double branches forms species C and D. The first branch
   point in the tree is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A, B, C, D,
   and E. The point where the tree branches into species A and B is labeled
   Most recent common ancestor of A and B.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   Each horizontal line in our tree represents a series of ancestors, leading
   up to the species at its end. For instance, the line leading up to species
   E represents the species' ancestors since it diverged from the other
   species in the tree. Similarly, the root represents a series of ancestors
   leading up to the most recent common ancestor of all the species in the
   tree.

Which species are more related?

   In a phylogenetic tree, the relatedness of two species has a very specific
   meaning. Two species are more related if they have a more recent common
   ancestor, and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.
   We can use a pretty straightforward method to find the most recent common
   ancestor of any pair or group of species. In this method, we start at the
   branch ends carrying the two species of interest and “walk backwards” in
   the tree until we find the point where the species’ lines converge.
   For instance, suppose that we wanted to say whether A and B or B and C are
   more closely related. To do so, we would follow the lines of both pairs of
   species backward in the tree. Since A and B converge at a common ancestor
   first as we move backwards, and B only converges with C after its junction
   point with A, we can say that A and B are more related than B and C.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D. The point where the tree branches
   into species A and B is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A and B. A
   pink line traces from species A back to this point, while a red line
   traces from species B back to this point. The point where the tree
   branches into a pair of double branches is labeled Most recent common
   ancestor of B and C. A red line traces from species B back to this point,
   while a lavender line traces from species C back to this point.

   al., CC BY 4.0
   Importantly, there are some species whose relatedness we can't compare
   using this method. For instance, we can't say whether A and B are more
   closely related than C and D. That’s because, by default, the horizontal
   axis of the tree doesn't represent time in a direct way. So, we can only
   compare the timing of branching events that occur on the same lineage
   (same direct line from the root of the tree), and not those that occur on
   different lineages.

Some tips for reading phylogenetic trees

   You may see phylogenetic trees drawn in many different formats. Some are
   blocky, like the tree at left below. Others use diagonal lines, like the
   tree at right below. You may also see trees of either kind oriented
   vertically or flipped on their sides, as shown for the blocky tree.
   Three examples of phylogenetic trees. The first tree is horizontal with a
   root on the left and branches forming 90 degree angles before forming
   species on the right hand side. The second tree is similar to the first
   tree, but it is vertical, with the root at the bottom and the species
   listed at the top. The third tree is similar to the second tree, but the
   branches are diagonal.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The three trees above represent identical relationships among species A,
   B, C, D, and E. You may want to take a moment to convince yourself that
   this is really the case – that is, that no branching patterns or
   recent-ness of common ancestors are different between the two trees. The
   identical information in these different-looking trees reminds us that
   it's the branching pattern (and not the lengths of branches) that's
   meaningful in a typical tree.
   Another critical point about these trees is that if you rotate the
   structures, using one of the branch points as a pivot, you don’t change
   the relationships. So just like the two trees above, which show the same
   relationships even though they are formatted differently, all of the trees
   below show the same relationships among four species:
   A series of vertical phylogenetic trees showing that phylogenetic trees
   can be rotated at a branch, resulting in the same tree. Numbers will be
   assigned to the branches for description, but do not appear in the
   diagram. The first tree begins with a root at the bottom, which splits
   into branches 1 and 2. Branch 1 becomes species W. Branch 2 splits into
   branches 3 and 4. Branch 3 becomes species X. Branch 4 splits into
   branches 5 and 6, which becomes species Y and Z respectively. The species
   are listed from left to right as W, X, Y, and Z. If branch 2 is rotated
   horizontally 180 degrees it results in the same tree, although the species
   are listed from left to right as W, Z, Y, and X. At the bottom of the
   diagram four equal trees are shown, but with rotations occurring at
   different branches.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 3 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   If you don’t see right away how that is true (and I didn’t, on first
   read!), just concentrate on the relationships and the branch points rather
   than on the ordering of species (W, X, Y, and Z) across the tops of the
   diagrams. That ordering actually doesn’t give us useful information.
   Instead, it’s the branch structure of each diagram that tells us what we
   need to understand the tree.
   So far, all the trees we've looked at have had nice, clean branching
   patterns, with just two lineages (lines of descent) emerging from each
   branch point. However, you may see trees with a polytomy (poly, many;
   tomy, cuts), meaning a branch point that has three or more different
   species coming off of it2‍ . In general, a polytomy shows where we don't
   have enough information to determine branching order.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. The root branches into a lower branch that
   becomes species U and an upper branch that further splits into two
   branches. The bottom branch splits into two branches, forming species S
   and T. The top branch splits into 3 branches, forming species P, Q, and R.
   These three species are highlighted and labeled Polytomy: we don't have
   enough info to determine branching order!

   al., CC BY 4.0
   If we later get more information about the species in a tree, we may be
   able to resolve a polytomy using the new information.

Where do these trees come from?

   To generate a phylogenetic tree, scientists often compare and analyze many
   characteristics of the species or other groups involved. These
   characteristics can include external morphology (shape/appearance),
   internal anatomy, behaviors, biochemical pathways, DNA and protein
   sequences, and even the characteristics of fossils.
   To build accurate, meaningful trees, biologists will often use many
   different characteristics (reducing the chances of any one imperfect piece
   of data leading to a wrong tree). Still, phylogenetic trees are
   hypotheses, not definitive answers, and they can only be as good as the
   data available when they're made. Trees are revised and updated over time
   as new data becomes available and can be added to the analysis. This is
   particularly true today, as DNA sequencing increases our ability to
   compare genes between species.
   In the next article on building a tree, we’ll see concrete examples of how
   different types of data are used to organize species into phylogenetic
   trees.

            more
            Look at (or make) a tree showing your family going back at least
            to your grandparents.

            First question: What does this tell you about people in your
            family?

            Phylogenetic trees are really very similar, but for species
            rather than individuals within a family.

            Second question: What do you mean by "more evolved"?

            Does this help?

            One example that comes to mind is that a phylogenetic tree
            determines where two organisms diverged from their common
            ancestors but not specifically when. These diagrams are not
            chronological in a direct way, more so a before and after
            situation. (Hope I helped, correct me if I am wrong)

            Phenetic speciation means classification of species by appearance
            alone. For example if two frogs look similar they are called a
            species even if they cannot mate.
            Phylogenetic classification does consider appearance and
            phenotype, but it also goes much further in terms of looking at
            functionality, and comparison of genomes. Phylogentics explains
            an organisms evolutionary history. This is a more rigorous system
            than phenetics.

            It is a difficult task. What you are asking is phylogenetic
            reconstruction from genomic sequence analysis. There are some
            ways to do this. One obvious way is to consider two species
            closest if they match at more base pairs. But what is difficult
            is to decide if one arose from the other or if they are at the
            same level, arising from a different common ancestor.

            All of this is very difficult and many algorithms are available,
            especially since genomic data itself is large, complex (different
            kinds of genomic data is available - RNA, DNA, Methylated DNA
            etc) and also based on what we know of the function of the genes
            (difference in functional gene is a more significant difference
            than the difference in non-functional genes).

            If you are interested, look up maximum-parsimony methods of
            phylogenetic tree reconstructions.

            The most accurate phylogenetic tree will have the fewest nodes.
            It's something called parsimony which means that the best tree is
            the simplest.

   Trees

   A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or
   as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data
   structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections
   between elements, giving a tree graph.

   Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of
   trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices.

   A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends
   containing no closed loops (cycles). In other words, it is a simple,
   undirected, connected, acyclic graph (or, equivalently, a connected
   forest). A tree with n nodes has n-1 graph edges. Conversely, a connected
   graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. All trees are bipartite graphs
   (Skiena 1990, p. 213). Trees with no particular node singled out are
   sometimes called free trees (or unrooted tree), by way of distinguishing
   them from rooted trees (Skiena 1990, Knuth 1997).

   The points of connection are known as forks and the segments as branches.
   Final segments and the nodes at their ends are called tree leaves. A tree
   with two branches at each fork and with one or two tree leaves at the end
   of each branch is called a binary tree.

   A graph can be tested in the Wolfram Language to see if it is a tree using
   TreeGraphQ[g].

   Hydrocarbons

   Trees find applications in many diverse fields, including computer
   science, the enumeration of saturated hydrocarbons, the study of
   electrical circuits, etc. (Harary 1994, p. 4). The graphs graphs
   corresponding to linear hydrocarbons illustrated above are known as
   (n-)alkane graphs (or sometimes caterpillar graphs).

   Trees are block graphs.

   A tree T has either one node that is a graph center, in which case it is
   called a centered tree, or two adjacent nodes that are graph centers, in
   which case it is called a bicentered tree (Harary 1994, p. 35).

   When a special node is designated to turn a tree into a rooted tree, it is
   called the root (or sometimes "Eve"). In such a tree, each of the nodes
   that is one graph edge further away from a given node is called a child,
   and nodes connected to the same node that are the same distance from the
   root vertex are called siblings.

   Note that two branches placed end-to-end are equivalent to a single
   branch, which means for example, that there is only one tree of order 3.
   The number t(n) of nonisomorphic trees of order n=1, 2, ... (where trees
   of orders 1, 2, ..., 6 are illustrated above), are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11,
   23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ... (OEIS A000055).

   The generating functions for the number of rooted trees

                  T(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)T_nx^n                         (1) 
                       =  xexp[sum_(r=1)^(infty)1/rT(x^r)]                (2) 

   is related to the generating function for the number of unrooted trees
   t(x) by

                      t(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)t_nx^n                     (3) 
                           =  T(x)-1/2[T^2(x)-T(x^2)].                    (4) 

   Otter showed that

   lim_(n-@gt;infty)(t_nn^(5/2))/(alpha^n)=beta,                             (5) 

   (Otter 1948, Harary and Palmer 1973, Knuth 1997), where alpha and beta are
   two constants. alpha is given by

                   alpha =  lim_(n-@gt;infty)(T_n)/(T_(n-1))                 (6) 
                         =  2.955765...                                   (7) 

   (OEIS A051491; Odlyzko 1995; Knuth 1997, p. 396, where Knuth writes
   1/alpha=2.9557... instead of alpha=2.9557...) and also as the unique
   positive root of

   T(1/x)=1.                                                              (8) 

   The constant beta is given by

beta = 1/(sqrt(2pi))[1+sum_(k=2)^(infty)T^'(1/(alpha^k))1/(alpha^k)]^(3/2)  (9) 
     = 0.5349485...                                                        (10) 

   (OEIS A086308; Knuth 1997, p. 396).

   If t_n is the number of nonisomorphic trees on n nodes, then an asymptotic
   series for t_n is given by

t_n∼alpha^nn^(-5/2)(0.5349496061...+(0.0441699018...)/n+(0.4853877311...)/(n^2)+(2.379745574...)/(n^3)+...), (11) 

   where the constants can be computed in terms of partial derivatives of the
   function

   F(x,y)=xexp[y+sum_(k=2)^infty(T(x^k))/k]-y                            (12) 

   (Plotkin and Rosenthal 1994; Finch 2003).

                             1.10. Decision Trees¶

   Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used
   for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that
   predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules
   inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise
   constant approximation.

   For instance, in the example below, decision trees learn from data to
   approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The
   deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the
   model.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Some advantages of decision trees are:

       * Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.

       * Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require
         data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank
         values to be removed. Some tree and algorithm combinations support
         missing values.

       * The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in
         the number of data points used to train the tree.

       * Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the
         scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables
         for now. Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing
         datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for
         more information.

       * Able to handle multi-output problems.

       * Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a
         model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by
         boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an
         artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to
         interpret.

       * Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it
         possible to account for the reliability of the model.

       * Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the
         true model from which the data were generated.

   The disadvantages of decision trees include:

       * Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
         generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms
         such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a
         leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to
         avoid this problem.

       * Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
         might result in a completely different tree being generated. This
         problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.

       * Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but
         piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure.
         Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.

       * The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
         NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple
         concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms
         are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where
         locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms
         cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This
         can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner,
         where the features and samples are randomly sampled with
         replacement.

       * There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do
         not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer
         problems.

       * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
         It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting
         with the decision tree.

1.10.1. Classification¶

   DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class
   classification on a dataset.

   As with other classifiers, DecisionTreeClassifier takes as input two
   arrays: an array X, sparse or dense, of shape (n_samples, n_features)
   holding the training samples, and an array Y of integer values, shape
   (n_samples,), holding the class labels for the training samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; Y = [0, 1]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

   After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict the class of
   samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict([[2., 2.]])
 array([1])

   In case that there are multiple classes with the same and highest
   probability, the classifier will predict the class with the lowest index
   amongst those classes.

   As an alternative to outputting a specific class, the probability of each
   class can be predicted, which is the fraction of training samples of the
   class in a leaf:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict_proba([[2., 2.]])
 array([[0., 1.]])

   DecisionTreeClassifier is capable of both binary (where the labels are
   [-1, 1]) classification and multiclass (where the labels are [0, …, K-1])
   classification.

   Using the Iris dataset, we can construct a tree as follows:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; iris = load_iris()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X, y = iris.data, iris.target
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)

   Once trained, you can plot the tree with the plot_tree function:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.plot_tree(clf)
 [...]

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_iris_dtc_002.png

   Alternative ways to export trees Click for more details

   We can also export the tree in Graphviz format using the export_graphviz
   exporter. If you use the conda package manager, the graphviz binaries and
   the python package can be installed with conda install python-graphviz.

   Alternatively binaries for graphviz can be downloaded from the graphviz
   project homepage, and the Python wrapper installed from pypi with pip
   install graphviz.

   Below is an example graphviz export of the above tree trained on the
   entire iris dataset; the results are saved in an output file iris.pdf:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; import graphviz
 @gt;@gt;@gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; graph.render("iris")

   The export_graphviz exporter also supports a variety of aesthetic options,
   including coloring nodes by their class (or value for regression) and
   using explicit variable and class names if desired. Jupyter notebooks also
   render these plots inline automatically:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None,
 ...                      feature_names=iris.feature_names, 
 ...                      class_names=iris.target_names, 
 ...                      filled=True, rounded=True, 
 ...                      special_characters=True)

   Alternatively, the tree can also be exported in textual format with the
   function export_text. This method doesn’t require the installation of
   external libraries and is more compact:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import export_text
 @gt;@gt;@gt; iris = load_iris()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0, max_depth=2)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; decision_tree = decision_tree.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; r = export_text(decision_tree, feature_names=iris['feature_names'])
 @gt;@gt;@gt; print(r)
 |--- petal width (cm) @lt;= 0.80
 |   |--- class: 0
 |--- petal width (cm) @gt;  0.80
 |   |--- petal width (cm) @lt;= 1.75
 |   |   |--- class: 1
 |   |--- petal width (cm) @gt;  1.75
 |   |   |--- class: 2

1.10.2. Regression¶

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Decision trees can also be applied to regression problems, using the
   DecisionTreeRegressor class.

   As in the classification setting, the fit method will take as argument
   arrays X and y, only that in this case y is expected to have floating
   point values instead of integer values:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = [[0, 0], [2, 2]]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0.5, 2.5]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict([[1, 1]])
 array([0.5])

   Examples:

     * Decision Tree Regression

1.10.3. Multi-output problems¶

   A multi-output problem is a supervised learning problem with several
   outputs to predict, that is when Y is a 2d array of shape (n_samples,
   n_outputs).

   When there is no correlation between the outputs, a very simple way to
   solve this kind of problem is to build n independent models, i.e. one for
   each output, and then to use those models to independently predict each
   one of the n outputs. However, because it is likely that the output values
   related to the same input are themselves correlated, an often better way
   is to build a single model capable of predicting simultaneously all n
   outputs. First, it requires lower training time since only a single
   estimator is built. Second, the generalization accuracy of the resulting
   estimator may often be increased.

   With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to
   support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes:

       * Store n output values in leaves, instead of 1;

       * Use splitting criteria that compute the average reduction across all
         n outputs.

   This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this
   strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor. If a
   decision tree is fit on an output array Y of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
   then the resulting estimator will:

       * Output n_output values upon predict;

       * Output a list of n_output arrays of class probabilities upon
         predict_proba.

   The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in
   Multi-output Decision Tree Regression. In this example, the input X is a
   single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_multioutput_001.png

   The use of multi-output trees for classification is demonstrated in Face
   completion with a multi-output estimators. In this example, the inputs X
   are the pixels of the upper half of faces and the outputs Y are the pixels
   of the lower half of those faces.

1.10.4. Complexity¶

   In general, the run time cost to construct a balanced binary tree is
   \(O(n_{samples}n_{features}\log(n_{samples}))\) and query time
   \(O(\log(n_{samples}))\). Although the tree construction algorithm
   attempts to generate balanced trees, they will not always be balanced.
   Assuming that the subtrees remain approximately balanced, the cost at each
   node consists of searching through \(O(n_{features})\) to find the feature
   that offers the largest reduction in the impurity criterion, e.g. log loss
   (which is equivalent to an information gain). This has a cost of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}\log(n_{samples}))\) at each node, leading to a
   total cost over the entire trees (by summing the cost at each node) of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}^{2}\log(n_{samples}))\).

1.10.5. Tips on practical use¶

       * Decision trees tend to overfit on data with a large number of
         features. Getting the right ratio of samples to number of features
         is important, since a tree with few samples in high dimensional
         space is very likely to overfit.

       * Consider performing dimensionality reduction (PCA, ICA, or Feature
         selection) beforehand to give your tree a better chance of finding
         features that are discriminative.

       * Understanding the decision tree structure will help in gaining more
         insights about how the decision tree makes predictions, which is
         important for understanding the important features in the data.

       * Visualize your tree as you are training by using the export
         function. Use max_depth=3 as an initial tree depth to get a feel for
         how the tree is fitting to your data, and then increase the depth.

       * Remember that the number of samples required to populate the tree
         doubles for each additional level the tree grows to. Use max_depth
         to control the size of the tree to prevent overfitting.

       * Use min_samples_split or min_samples_leaf to ensure that multiple
         samples inform every decision in the tree, by controlling which
         splits will be considered. A very small number will usually mean the
         tree will overfit, whereas a large number will prevent the tree from
         learning the data. Try min_samples_leaf=5 as an initial value. If
         the sample size varies greatly, a float number can be used as
         percentage in these two parameters. While min_samples_split can
         create arbitrarily small leaves, min_samples_leaf guarantees that
         each leaf has a minimum size, avoiding low-variance, over-fit leaf
         nodes in regression problems. For classification with few classes,
         min_samples_leaf=1 is often the best choice.

         Note that min_samples_split considers samples directly and
         independent of sample_weight, if provided (e.g. a node with m
         weighted samples is still treated as having exactly m samples).
         Consider min_weight_fraction_leaf or min_impurity_decrease if
         accounting for sample weights is required at splits.

       * Balance your dataset before training to prevent the tree from being
         biased toward the classes that are dominant. Class balancing can be
         done by sampling an equal number of samples from each class, or
         preferably by normalizing the sum of the sample weights
         (sample_weight) for each class to the same value. Also note that
         weight-based pre-pruning criteria, such as min_weight_fraction_leaf,
         will then be less biased toward dominant classes than criteria that
         are not aware of the sample weights, like min_samples_leaf.

       * If the samples are weighted, it will be easier to optimize the tree
         structure using weight-based pre-pruning criterion such as
         min_weight_fraction_leaf, which ensure that leaf nodes contain at
         least a fraction of the overall sum of the sample weights.

       * All decision trees use np.float32 arrays internally. If training
         data is not in this format, a copy of the dataset will be made.

       * If the input matrix X is very sparse, it is recommended to convert
         to sparse csc_matrix before calling fit and sparse csr_matrix before
         calling predict. Training time can be orders of magnitude faster for
         a sparse matrix input compared to a dense matrix when features have
         zero values in most of the samples.

1.10.6. Tree algorithms: ID3, C4.5, C5.0 and CART¶

   What are all the various decision tree algorithms and how do they differ
   from each other? Which one is implemented in scikit-learn?

   Various decision tree algorithms Click for more details

   ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The
   algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy
   manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information
   gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and
   then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree
   to generalize to unseen data.

   C4.5 is the successor to ID3 and removed the restriction that features
   must be categorical by dynamically defining a discrete attribute (based on
   numerical variables) that partitions the continuous attribute value into a
   discrete set of intervals. C4.5 converts the trained trees (i.e. the
   output of the ID3 algorithm) into sets of if-then rules. The accuracy of
   each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be
   applied. Pruning is done by removing a rule’s precondition if the accuracy
   of the rule improves without it.

   C5.0 is Quinlan’s latest version release under a proprietary license. It
   uses less memory and builds smaller rulesets than C4.5 while being more
   accurate.

   CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is very similar to C4.5, but it
   differs in that it supports numerical target variables (regression) and
   does not compute rule sets. CART constructs binary trees using the feature
   and threshold that yield the largest information gain at each node.

   scikit-learn uses an optimized version of the CART algorithm; however, the
   scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for
   now.

1.10.7. Mathematical formulation¶

   Given training vectors \(x_i \in R^n\), i=1,…, l and a label vector \(y
   \in R^l\), a decision tree recursively partitions the feature space such
   that the samples with the same labels or similar target values are grouped
   together.

   Let the data at node \(m\) be represented by \(Q_m\) with \(n_m\) samples.
   For each candidate split \(\theta = (j, t_m)\) consisting of a feature
   \(j\) and threshold \(t_m\), partition the data into
   \(Q_m^{left}(\theta)\) and \(Q_m^{right}(\theta)\) subsets

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}Q_m^{left}(\theta) = \{(x, y) | x_j \leq
   t_m\}\\Q_m^{right}(\theta) = Q_m \setminus
   Q_m^{left}(\theta)\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   The quality of a candidate split of node \(m\) is then computed using an
   impurity function or loss function \(H()\), the choice of which depends on
   the task being solved (classification or regression)

   \[G(Q_m, \theta) = \frac{n_m^{left}}{n_m} H(Q_m^{left}(\theta)) +
   \frac{n_m^{right}}{n_m} H(Q_m^{right}(\theta))\]

   Select the parameters that minimises the impurity

   \[\theta^* = \operatorname{argmin}_\theta G(Q_m, \theta)\]

   Recurse for subsets \(Q_m^{left}(\theta^*)\) and \(Q_m^{right}(\theta^*)\)
   until the maximum allowable depth is reached, \(n_m @lt; \min_{samples}\) or
   \(n_m = 1\).

  1.10.7.1. Classification criteria¶

   If a target is a classification outcome taking on values 0,1,…,K-1, for
   node \(m\), let

   \[p_{mk} = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} I(y = k)\]

   be the proportion of class k observations in node \(m\). If \(m\) is a
   terminal node, predict_proba for this region is set to \(p_{mk}\). Common
   measures of impurity are the following.

   Gini:

   \[H(Q_m) = \sum_k p_{mk} (1 - p_{mk})\]

   Log Loss or Entropy:

   \[H(Q_m) = - \sum_k p_{mk} \log(p_{mk})\]

   Shannon entropy: Click for more details

     The entropy criterion computes the Shannon entropy of the possible
     classes. It takes the class frequencies of the training data points that
     reached a given leaf \(m\) as their probability. Using the Shannon
     entropy as tree node splitting criterion is equivalent to minimizing the
     log loss (also known as cross-entropy and multinomial deviance) between
     the true labels \(y_i\) and the probabilistic predictions \(T_k(x_i)\)
     of the tree model \(T\) for class \(k\).

     To see this, first recall that the log loss of a tree model \(T\)
     computed on a dataset \(D\) is defined as follows:

     \[\mathrm{LL}(D, T) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{(x_i, y_i) \in D} \sum_k I(y_i
     = k) \log(T_k(x_i))\]

     where \(D\) is a training dataset of \(n\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\).

     In a classification tree, the predicted class probabilities within leaf
     nodes are constant, that is: for all \((x_i, y_i) \in Q_m\), one has:
     \(T_k(x_i) = p_{mk}\) for each class \(k\).

     This property makes it possible to rewrite \(\mathrm{LL}(D, T)\) as the
     sum of the Shannon entropies computed for each leaf of \(T\) weighted by
     the number of training data points that reached each leaf:

     \[\mathrm{LL}(D, T) = \sum_{m \in T} \frac{n_m}{n} H(Q_m)\]

  1.10.7.2. Regression criteria¶

   If the target is a continuous value, then for node \(m\), common criteria
   to minimize as for determining locations for future splits are Mean
   Squared Error (MSE or L2 error), Poisson deviance as well as Mean Absolute
   Error (MAE or L1 error). MSE and Poisson deviance both set the predicted
   value of terminal nodes to the learned mean value \(\bar{y}_m\) of the
   node whereas the MAE sets the predicted value of terminal nodes to the
   median \(median(y)_m\).

   Mean Squared Error:

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\bar{y}_m = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m}
   y\\H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} (y -
   \bar{y}_m)^2\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   Half Poisson deviance:

   \[H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} (y \log\frac{y}{\bar{y}_m} - y +
   \bar{y}_m)\]

   Setting criterion="poisson" might be a good choice if your target is a
   count or a frequency (count per some unit). In any case, \(y @gt;= 0\) is a
   necessary condition to use this criterion. Note that it fits much slower
   than the MSE criterion.

   Mean Absolute Error:

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}median(y)_m = \underset{y \in
   Q_m}{\mathrm{median}}(y)\\H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} |y -
   median(y)_m|\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   Note that it fits much slower than the MSE criterion.

1.10.8. Missing Values Support¶

   DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor have built-in support for
   missing values when splitter='best' and criterion is 'gini', 'entropy’, or
   'log_loss', for classification or 'squared_error', 'friedman_mse', or
   'poisson' for regression.

   For each potential threshold on the non-missing data, the splitter will
   evaluate the split with all the missing values going to the left node or
   the right node.

   Decisions are made as follows:

       * By default when predicting, the samples with missing values are
         classified with the class used in the split found during training:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([0, 1, 6, np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X)
 array([0, 0, 1, 1])

       * If the the criterion evaluation is the same for both nodes, then the
         tie for missing value at predict time is broken by going to the
         right node. The splitter also checks the split where all the missing
         values go to one child and non-missing values go to the other:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([np.nan, -1, np.nan, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X_test = np.array([np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X_test)
 array([1])

       * If no missing values are seen during training for a given feature,
         then during prediction missing values are mapped to the child with
         the most samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 1, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X_test = np.array([np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X_test)
 array([1])

1.10.9. Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning¶

   Minimal cost-complexity pruning is an algorithm used to prune a tree to
   avoid over-fitting, described in Chapter 3 of [BRE]. This algorithm is
   parameterized by \(\alpha\ge0\) known as the complexity parameter. The
   complexity parameter is used to define the cost-complexity measure,
   \(R_\alpha(T)\) of a given tree \(T\):

   \[R_\alpha(T) = R(T) + \alpha|\widetilde{T}|\]

   where \(|\widetilde{T}|\) is the number of terminal nodes in \(T\) and
   \(R(T)\) is traditionally defined as the total misclassification rate of
   the terminal nodes. Alternatively, scikit-learn uses the total sample
   weighted impurity of the terminal nodes for \(R(T)\). As shown above, the
   impurity of a node depends on the criterion. Minimal cost-complexity
   pruning finds the subtree of \(T\) that minimizes \(R_\alpha(T)\).

   The cost complexity measure of a single node is
   \(R_\alpha(t)=R(t)+\alpha\). The branch, \(T_t\), is defined to be a tree
   where node \(t\) is its root. In general, the impurity of a node is
   greater than the sum of impurities of its terminal nodes, \(R(T_t)@lt;R(t)\).
   However, the cost complexity measure of a node, \(t\), and its branch,
   \(T_t\), can be equal depending on \(\alpha\). We define the effective
   \(\alpha\) of a node to be the value where they are equal,
   \(R_\alpha(T_t)=R_\alpha(t)\) or
   \(\alpha_{eff}(t)=\frac{R(t)-R(T_t)}{|T|-1}\). A non-terminal node with
   the smallest value of \(\alpha_{eff}\) is the weakest link and will be
   pruned. This process stops when the pruned tree’s minimal \(\alpha_{eff}\)
   is greater than the ccp_alpha parameter.

                                   tree (n.)

   Old English treo, treow "tree" (also "timber, wood, beam, log, stake"),
   from Proto-Germanic *trewam (source also of Old Frisian tre, Old Saxon
   trio, Old Norse tre, Gothic triu "tree"), from PIE *drew-o-, suffixed
   variant form of root *deru- "be firm, solid, steadfast," with specialized
   senses "wood, tree" and derivatives referring to objects made of wood.

     The line which divides trees from shrubs is largely arbitrary, and
     dependent upon habit rather than size, the tree having a single trunk
     usually unbranched for some distance above the ground, while a shrub has
     usually several stems from the same root and each without a proper
     trunk. [Century Dictionary]

   In Old English and Middle English also "thing made of wood," especially
   the cross of the Crucifixion and a gallows (such as Tyburn tree, famous
   gallows outside London). Middle English also had plural treen, adjective
   treen (Old English treowen "of a tree, wooden"). For Dutch boom, German
   Baum, the usual words for "tree," see beam (n.).

   The meaning "framework of a saddle" is from 1530s. The meaning
   "representation of familial relationships in the form of a tree" is from
   c. 1300. Tree-hugger, contemptuous for "environmentalist" is attested by
   1989.

     Minc'd Pyes do not grow upon every tree,

     But search the Ovens for them, and there they be.

     ["Poor Robin," Almanack, 1669]

   tree (v.)

   "to chase up a tree," 1700, from tree (n.). Meaning "take a tree-like
   form" is from 1884. Related: Treed; treeing.

   also from 1700

   beam (n.)

   Old English beam, "living tree," but by late 10c. also "rafter, post,
   ship's timber," from Proto-Germanic *baumaz "tree" (source also of Old
   Frisian bam "tree, gallows, beam," Middle Dutch boom, Old High German
   boum, German Baum "tree," and perhaps also (with unexplained sound
   changes) Old Norse baðmr, Gothic bagms). This is of uncertain etymology
   (according to Boutkan probably a substrate word). The shift from *-au- to
   -ea- is regular in Old English.

   The meaning "ray of light" developed in Old English, probably because beam
   was used by Bede to render Latin columna (lucis), the Biblical "pillar of
   fire." The meaning "directed flow of radiation" is from 1906. To be on the
   beam "going in the right direction" (1941) originally was an aviator's
   term for "to follow the course indicated by a radio beam."

   The nautical sense of "one of the horizontal transverse timbers holding a
   ship together" is from early 13c., hence "greatest breadth of a ship," and
   slang broad in the beam, by 1894 of ships; of persons, "wide-hipped," by
   1938.

   *deru- 

   also *dreu-, Proto-Indo-European root meaning "be firm, solid, steadfast,"
   with specialized senses "wood," "tree" and derivatives referring to
   objects made of wood.

Toledo man left paralyzed after tree trimming accident speaks out for the first
                          time in exclusive interview

   Matt Thieman and his brother Tony were cutting down a tree in their
   mother’s Toledo yard on Dec. 16.
   By Carli Petrus
   Published: Jan. 4, 2024 at 6:44 AM EST

   TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - A local tree trimmer speaking out for the very first
   time after he was left paralyzed in a freak accident just a few weeks ago.

   Matt Thieman says he and his brother Tony were cutting down a tree in
   their mother’s Toledo yard on December 16, 2023, when a dead limb fell and
   crushed his body.

   “The speed of the log coming, it was just, there wasn’t enough time to get
   out of the way, and it was enough to smash me head to toe to the ground,”
   said Thieman. “I covered my head and it smashed right through my arm and
   busted everything up.”

   With more than 20 years in the tree trimming business, Thieman says this
   was never supposed to happen.

   “I just remember that we were using rope, doing everything correctly,
   having it tied off.”

   Now laying in a rehab center, paralyzed from the chest down he says all he
   can do is just take it day by day.

   “I’m rolling with the punches and trying to find my way through,” Thieman
   said.

   He believes the outpour of support from loved ones is helping him stay
   positive. Even strangers are reaching out to lend a helping hand.

   A 13 Action News viewer donated his late wife’s barely used electric
   wheelchair to Thieman after seeing the original story about the accident.

   “When I saw the article it just had to go, it had to go to him,” said the
   viewer who wished to stay anonymous.

   Although the road to recovery for Thieman will be a long one, he says he
   is choosing to take the high road.

What Is a Tree?

   Trees grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. Like all plants,
   trees manufacture their food through photosynthesis. Trees are in the
   family of woody plants which have cambium, a special layer of cells that
   allow the tree to increase in girth and are self supporting with a single
   stem. Trees are perennials and can live for many years. The oldest known
   tree species is the Great Basin bristlecone pine, which is believed to
   reach ages of over 5,000 years old!

   Food for trees is produced through a complex system starting with the
   leaves. Leaves produce sugar as a result of photosynthesis which combines
   carbon dioxide and sunlight. The by-product of photosynthesis that Trees
   produce is oxygen—a vital resource for other living organisms. Sugar that
   is produced runs down through the tree, under the bark down the trunk and
   to the roots of the tree. The sugar combines at the roots with minerals
   and water in the ground to move back up the tree trunk and under the bark
   back to the leaves to which starts the cycle of photosynthesis again.
   Along the way, minerals, water and sugar stimulate the growth and
   development of the tree or assist in its reproduction.

Tree Types

   Trees can divided into two categories: deciduous and coniferous.

   Deciduous trees are also known as broadleaf trees because the leaves are
   generally larger and wider than those of conifers. The larger leaf size
   means a greater surface area for photosynthesis, but it also means the
   leaf is too fragile to withstand winter conditions. Therefore, most
   deciduous trees drop their leaves in autumn.

   Coniferous trees keep their leaves throughout the year, shedding only the
   oldest leaves. Usually these leaves are lower down on the tree and do not
   receive as much sunlight as newly developed leaves higher up. Some of the
   best-known members of the conifer family are pines, spruces, firs, and
   hemlocks. The cones of the conifers are its flowers.

Parts of a Tree

   Tree parts diagram showing crown, leaves, branch, trunk, root collar, and
   roots

   The crown of the tree is made up of the leaves and branches.

   The trunk of the tree supports the crown and serves as a highway for food
   made in the leaves to travel to the roots and for water and nutrients from
   the roots to travel to the leaves.

   The root collar is located at the base of the trunk just above where the
   roots join. Also called the root flare, due to the flared shape on some
   tree species, the root collar must always remain above ground when
   planting and mulching.

   The roots of the tree support the trunk and crown, and also anchor the
   tree in the soil. They serve as a storage facility during the winter for
   the food produced by the leaves during the growing season. The roots also
   absorb water and nutrients from the soil for use by the tree.

   Many wildlife species depend on trees for food, water, cover, or places to
   raise their young. You can help wildlife by planting trees and creating
   habitat in your community!

   tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most
   plants classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing
   woody tissues, and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs,
   called branches.

   To many, the word tree evokes images of such ancient, powerful, and
   majestic structures as oaks and sequoias, the latter being among the most
   massive and longest-living organisms in the world. Although the majority
   of Earth’s terrestrial biomass is represented by trees, the fundamental
   importance of these seemingly ubiquitous plants for the very existence and
   diversity of life on Earth is perhaps not fully appreciated. The biosphere
   is dependent on the metabolism, death, and recycling of plants, especially
   trees. Their vast trunks and root systems store carbon dioxide, move
   water, and produce oxygen that is released into the atmosphere. The
   organic matter of the soil develops primarily from decayed leaves, twigs,
   branches, roots, and fallen trees, all of which recycle nitrogen, carbon,
   oxygen, and other important nutrients. There are few organisms as
   important as trees for maintaining Earth’s ecology.

   This article discusses the historical, popular, and botanical
   classifications of trees, their evolution, their importance to humans, and
   their general structure and patterns of growth. For more information on
   the three botanical groups that include trees, see fern (e.g., the tree
   ferns), gymnosperm (including conifers), and angiosperm (the flowering
   plants). For general information on plants, see plant.

Classification of trees

   The ancient Greeks developed a classification about 300 bce in which
   plants were grouped according to their general form—that is, as trees,
   shrubs, undershrubs, and vines. This classification was used for almost
   1,000 years. Modern classifications of plants attempt to assign a plant to
   a particular taxon and establish relationships with other plants based on
   genetics, cytology, ecology, behaviour, and probable evolutionary
   lineages, in addition to gross morphology. Popular classifications,
   however, remain useful tools for studying the common stresses that the
   environment exerts on all plants and the general patterns of adaptation
   that are shown no matter how distantly plants are related.

Phylogenetic classifications

   Trees are represented in each of the major groups of the vascular plants:
   pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants that include the tree ferns),
   gymnosperms (cycads, ginkgoes, and conifers), and angiosperms (flowering
   plants).

   Although tree ferns account for only a small percentage of ferns, many are
   conspicuous members of a forest, attaining heights of 7 to 10 metres (23
   to 33 feet); some are 15, 18, or occasionally 24 metres tall (49, 59, or
   79 feet). These graceful trees, which are natives of humid montane forests
   in the tropics and subtropics and of warm temperate regions of the
   Southern Hemisphere, have huge lacy leaves; they are the remnants of a
   vastly more numerous flora that populated much of Earth during the
   Carboniferous Period (about 358.9 to 298.9 million years ago).

   Cycads compose the Cycadophyta, a division of gymnospermous plants
   consisting of 4 families and approximately 140 species. Natives of warm
   regions of the Eastern and Western hemispheres, they also are remnants of
   a much larger number of species that in past geologic ages dominated
   Earth’s flora.

   ancient Buddhist temples in China and planted elsewhere as an ornamental
   since the mid-18th century; the tree probably no longer exists in a wild
   state.

   Conifers (division Pinophyta) are the largest group of gymnosperms and
   include trees and shrubs in 7 extant families and 545 species. Familiar
   representatives are araucarias, cedars, cypresses, Douglas firs, firs,
   hemlocks, junipers, larches, pines, podocarps, redwoods, spruces, and
   yews.

   Dominating Earth’s present flora are the angiosperms, with about 300,000
   species, among which are the majority of the world’s trees. Angiosperms
   are sometimes divided on the basis of a group of characteristics into two
   major groups: the monocotyledons and the eudicotyledons. The most numerous
   of the monocotyledonous trees are palms; others include agaves, aloes,
   dracaenas, screw pines, and yuccas. By far the greatest number of tree
   species are eudicotyledons; they are represented by such familiar groups
   as birches, elms, hollies, maples, oaks, poplars, ashes, and willows.

Ecological and evolutionary classification

   The tree is not an immutable biological category but rather a human
   concept based on visual criteria. Perhaps a general definition would
   describe a tree as a perennial woody plant that develops along a single
   main trunk to a height of at least 4.5 metres (15 feet) at maturity. This
   may be contrasted with a shrub, which might be loosely defined as a woody
   plant with multiple stems that is, in most cases, less than 3 metres
   (about 10 feet) tall. However, a species fitting the description of either
   in one area of the world might not necessarily do so in other regions,
   since a variety of stresses shape the habit of the mature plant. Thus, a
   given woody species may be a tree in one set of habitats within its range
   and a shrub elsewhere. For example, the spruce and fir may thrive in the
   tree form at the base of a mountain but assume a shrub form near the
   mountaintop, the variation due principally to stresses exerted by such
   environmental conditions as altitude, temperature, and oxygen tension.

   As seen in the section above, trees are found among many plant families
   that also include shrubs and herbs, so that the concept of tree is not a
   phylogenetic one. Further, there is no clear consensus as to whether the
   tree form is the advanced or primitive condition. Some paleobotanists
   suggest that trees are the most primitive members within these plant
   families. However, tree forms are found in all the vascular plants, from
   the club mosses and ferns to the gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is
   furthermore true that, among the flowering plants, trees are found not
   only among the most primitive members (order Magnoliales) but also among
   the more specialized, or advanced, members, such as the roses (order
   Rosales).

   Consequently, from both a taxonomic and a phylogenetic perspective, the
   tree is an artificial category. On an ecological basis, however, the tree
   can be recognized as a natural construct, as it represents an adaptive
   strategy by many different taxa to exploit and dominate the habitat above
   the ground.

   In the early stages of the development of terrestrial life, land plants
   were rootless and leafless. Since they had their origins in aqueous
   environments, they did not require the specialized conducting and
   supporting tissues afforded by roots and stems, nor did they require
   localized regions of carbohydrate synthesis, since each cell was involved
   in metabolism, water and nutrient absorption, and respiration. Habitats
   farther from the water as well as aerial habitats represented available
   uninhabited environments.

   One key to exploiting terrestrial habitats is increasing complexity of the
   plant’s form to allow specialization of function. This requires
   physiological and morphological complexity as well as biological
   optimization. If all the tissues of massive tree trunks were alive, for
   example, the physiological cost of maintaining these structures in the
   living state would be enormous and probably unattainable. An elegant
   solution came in the form of tremendous structural adaptations: new
   tissues and organs permitted localization of the functions of the plant
   body.

   The evolution of discrete plant body parts with separate functions allowed
   plants to move onto the land and undergo an incredible adaptive radiation.
   Leaves evolved as specialized photosynthetic organs. Stems provided
   mechanical strength as well as a conductive capacity to transport water
   and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Roots provided anchorage and
   absorption of sufficient water and nutrients to support the remainder of
   the plant.

                       What is a Tree? How Does it Work?

   Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, the usually wider
   and thinner-walled layer, called springwood, grows. In the summer, a
   thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
   typical in temperate forest trees.

Tree Physiology

     * A tree is a tall plant with woody tissue. Trees gather light for
       photosynthesis through their leaves; this process creates “food” for
       the tree.
     * Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and serves only to support the
       weight of the tree crown. The outside layers of the tree trunk are the
       only living portion. The cambium produces new wood and new bark.
     * The band of tissue outside of the cambium is the phloem. Phloem
       transports new materials (the sugars created from photosynthesis) from
       the crown to the roots. Dead phloem tissue becomes the bark of a tree.
     * The band of tissue just inside of the cambium is the xylem, which
       transports water from the roots to the crown. Dead xylem tissue forms
       the heartwood, or the wood we use for many different purposes.
     * Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, usually a
       wider and thinner-walled layer called springwood forms. In the summer,
       a thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
       typical in temperate forest trees.

Parts of a Tree

     * Leaves – broadleaf or needles; primary location for photosynthesis and
       production of hormones and other chemicals.
     * Twigs and Branches – support structures for leaves, flowers and
       fruits.
     * Crown – the upper part of the tree composed of leaves, twigs,
       branches, flowers and fruit.
     * Flowers – the site of reproduction. Trees can be male, female or both.
       Conifers, however, do not have petals and typical flower structures.
     * Fruits and Seeds – all trees have seeds, most are inside of the fruit.
     * Trunk – generally a single “stem,” but can be multiple-stemmed. Main
       functions are materials transport and support.
     * Bark – main function is to protect the living tissue called cambium
       from damage.
     * Roots – two main functions: (1) collect nutrients and water and (2)
       anchor the tree.

Trees Grow:

     * At the twig tips (apical meristem)
     * At the root tips (root apical meristem)
     * At the cambium (old xylem cells become heartwood, old phloem cells
       become bark)

Why do Leaves Change Color in the Fall?

   Chlorophyll production goes down as night length increases (fall and
   winter). The green colors are no longer reflected and other chemicals in
   the leaf become dominant, revealing red and yellow pigments.

   Weather during the period of declining chlorophyll production influences
   intensity of colors.

     * Warm fall weather generally reduces color quality.
     * Moist soils following a good growing season contribute to greater
       color intensity.
     * A few warm, sunny days and cool nights increase brilliance.
     * Drought usually results in poorer displays.

   Leaves fall in autumn as part of a tree’s preparation for winter dormancy.
   Because it is too cold for water to remain in the plant tissues (freezing
   water would rupture cells in the tree), and because the water in the soil
   is frozen and cannot be absorbed, trees shut down major processes in the
   cold months. Deciduous trees drop their leaves; conifers have strategies
   to maintain their needles during the winter.

   Two women had a lucky escape after a large tree, toppled by Storm Elin,
   fell onto their car in Lincolnshire.

   Photographer Duncan Young took pictures of the scene in Waltham Road,
   Brigsley near Grimsby, on Sunday.

   CCTV, seen by the BBC, showed the tree came down at about 20:30 GMT on
   Saturday, as much of the country was drenched and battered by the storm.

   Both women were left "shaken but unharmed" by their ordeal, Mr Young said.

   The CCTV shows the car going around a bend and avoiding a branch that had
   fallen in the road before coming to a halt.

   A split second later, the tree fell onto the car, with a large branch
   resting on the shattered windscreen.

   North East Lincolnshire Council confirmed the road would be closed for

   "throughout the night" to deal with a number of fallen trees.

   They added: "We would like to thank all our colleagues who have been
   called out throughout the night, working in extremely high winds and rain
   to make the area safe."
