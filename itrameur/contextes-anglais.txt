   [IMG]A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia [IMG]The original Encyclopédie (1752) used a tree diagram to
   show the way in which its subjects were ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the
   hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a
   "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree,
   with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are
   listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member
   is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting node. But the
   converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root
   node.

--
   its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children of "culture",
   which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also,
   "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of "science",
   "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and "craft", as
   leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a
   language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example
   being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase,
   with each in turn having other components which have other components),
   the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees
   of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the
   Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any
   other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

   Using Data Tools to Create Tree Equity

   The story is the same in nearly every city across the United States. With
   few exceptions, trees are sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged and
   neighborhoods of color and more prominent in wealthier, whiter
   neighborhoods. Redlining policies, dating back to the 1930s, helped

   American Forests is focused on addressing this inequity by focusing
   resources in neighborhoods of highest need. It’s our moral imperative to
   do so, given how many life-saving and quality of life benefits trees
   provide people. That is why we are working to create Tree Equity, which is
   about ensuring that all people experience the benefits of trees. One of
   the ways we are doing this is with our Tree Equity Score tool. It provides
   a social-equity-focused narrative, goals and a guide path for building

   What Do the Scores Mean?
   Each score indicates whether there are enough trees in a neighborhood for
   everyone to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that
   trees provide. Scores are based on tree canopy, surface temperature,
   income, employment, race, age, language and health factors. A

   An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science
   to represent the structure of a program or code snippet. It is a tree
   representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source
   code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a
   construct occurring in the text. It is sometimes called just a syntax
   tree.

   The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every
   detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or
   content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit
   in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate
   nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then statement
   may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

   This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees,
   traditionally designated parse trees. Parse trees are typically built by a
   parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once
   built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent
   processing, e.g., contextual analysis.

   Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program
   transformation systems.

Application in compilers[edit]

   Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to
   represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of
   the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an

   [IMG]Parse tree to SAAB

   A parse tree or parsing tree^[1] or derivation tree or concrete syntax
   tree is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of
   a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree
   itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical
   syntax, the term syntax tree is more common.

   Concrete syntax trees reflect the syntax of the input language, making
   them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming.
   Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse
   trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of
   constituents.

   Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency
   relation of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) or the
   dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated
   for sentences in natural languages (see natural language processing), as
   well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming
--
   transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic
   expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the
   form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated
   by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further
   transformational rules.^[2] A set of possible parse trees for a
   syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a "parse forest."^[3]

Nomenclature[edit]

   [IMG]A simple parse tree

   A parse tree is made up of nodes and branches.^[4] In the picture the
   parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of
   the leaf nodes (John, ball, the, hit). In a parse tree, each node is
   either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. In the above example, S
   is a root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, while John, ball, the, and hit
--
   In the example, S is a parent of both NP and VP. A child node is one which
   has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch
   of the tree. Again from our example, hit is a child node of V.

   A nonterminal function is a function (node) which is either a root or a
   branch in that tree whereas a terminal function is a function (node) in a
   parse tree which is a leaf.

   For binary trees (where each parent node has two immediate child nodes),
   the number of possible parse trees for a sentence with n words is given by
   the Catalan number C_{n}.

Constituency-based parse trees[edit]

   The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars (phrase
   structure grammars) distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes.
   The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar,
   while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories. The image below
   represents a constituency-based parse tree; it shows the syntactic
   structure of the English sentence John hit the ball:

   Parse tree PSG

   The parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each
   of the leaf nodes (John, hit, the, ball). The following abbreviations are
   used in the tree:

                           * S for sentence, the top-level structure in this
--
                           * N for noun

   Each node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf
   node.^[5] A root node is a node that does not have any branches on top of
   it. Within a sentence, there is only ever one root node. A branch node is
   a parent node that connects to two or more child nodes. A leaf node,
   however, is a terminal node that does not dominate other nodes in the
   tree. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, and John (N), hit
   (V), the (D), and ball (N) are all leaf nodes. The leaves are the lexical
   tokens of the sentence. A parent node is one that has at least one other
   node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both N
   and VP. A child node is one that has at least one node directly above it
   to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, hit is a
   child node of V. The terms mother and daughter are also sometimes used for
   this relationship.

Dependency-based parse trees[edit]

   The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars^[6] see all nodes
   as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between
   terminal and non-terminal categories. They are simpler on average than
   constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes. The
   dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows:

                                     Parse tree DG

   This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories (S, VP, and NP) seen in the
   constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree,
   constituent structure is acknowledged. Any complete sub-tree of the tree
   is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the
   subject noun John and the object noun phrase the ball as constituents just
   like the constituency-based parse tree does.

   The constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the
   additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse
   trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate.

Phrase markers[edit]
--
   further transformations.

   Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees (as in the above
   section on constituency-based parse trees), but are often given instead in
   the form of "bracketed expressions", which occupy less space in the
   memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the
   constituency-based tree given above may be something like :

           {\displaystyle [_{S}\ [_{\mathit {N}}\ {\text{John}}]\ [_{\mathit
--
           {\text{the}}]\ [_{N}\ {\text{ball}}]]]]}

   As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount
   of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points
   that the query author wishes to illustrate.

   Tree in which each leaf node describes an operand &amp; each interior node an
   operator. The syntax tree is shortened form of the Parse Tree.

   Example1 − Draw Syntax Tree for the string a + b ∗ c − d.

   Rules for constructing a syntax tree

   Each node in a syntax tree can be executed as data with multiple fields.
   In the node for an operator, one field recognizes the operator and the
   remaining field includes a pointer to the nodes for the operands. The
   operator is known as the label of the node. The following functions are
   used to create the nodes of the syntax tree for the expressions with
   binary operators. Each function returns a pointer to the recently
   generated node.
--
     * mkleaf (num, val) − It generates a number node with label num and a
       field including val, the value of the number. For example, construct a
       syntax tree for an expression a − 4 + c. In this sequence, p_1, p_2, …
       . . p_5are pointers to the symbol table entries for identifier 'a' and
       'c' respectively.
--
 p_5− mknode(′+′, p_3, p_4);

   The tree is generated in a bottom-up fashion. The function calls mkleaf
   (id, entry a) and mkleaf (num 4) construct the leaves for a and 4. The
   pointers to these nodes are stored using p_1and p_2. The call mknodes
   (′−′, p_1, p_2 ) then make the interior node with the leaves for a and 4
   as children. The syntax tree will be

   A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart
   representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More
   detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as
   genograms.

--

   Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a
   pedigree or ancestry chart. Family trees are often presented with the
   oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at
   the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an
   individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a
   tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry
   charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear
   to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the
   descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these
   formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular
   surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include
   all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which
--
   children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are
   often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the
   natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there
   can be great great grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living
   relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear
   adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a
   living family tree.^[citation needed]

   The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse
   in medieval art,^[1] used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms
   of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical
   use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely
   patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods
   in Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium ("On the Genealogy of the Gods
   of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.^[2]
--

   In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as
   a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and
   document ancestry and descent.

Graph theory[edit]

   While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in
   general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since
   distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor
   on both their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must

   acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent
   (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son
   relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry
   chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and
   one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on
   the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a

   Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and

   (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and
   includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving
   more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and
   revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was
   printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation
   Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the

   Adam, through the sons of Noah.

   Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which
   includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a
   13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and

   Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in
   religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent
   from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In
--
   the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed
   at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common
   Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the
   Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad
   greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new

   Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022,
   scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that
   unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history,
   ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for
   estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked
   trees along the genome, a tree-sequence,^[clarification needed] which has
   been described as the largest "human family tree".^[8]^[9]^[10]

Other uses[edit]

   The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced "family trees" of
   rock bands. In this instance, the entries represent a membership of
   certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family
   relationships. Several books have been produced with his family
   trees,^[11] which in turn have led to a BBC television series about them,
   including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.^[12]

   Another common use is in the creation of episcopal trees in Christian
   traditions that believe in apostolic succession. In this case, the
   connection is not made through blood, but through the order of succession

   Christmas tree decorated with lights, stars and glass balls. Wrapped
   presents are under treeChristmas tree decorated with lights, stars, and
   glass balls [IMG]Glade jul by Viggo Johansen (1891) [IMG]Typical North
   American family decorating Christmas tree (c. 1970s)

   A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such
   as a spruce, pine or fir, or an artificial tree of similar appearance,
   associated with the celebration of Christmas.^[1]

   The custom was developed in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia), where Protestant
   Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.^[2]^[3]^[4] The tree
   was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples,
   wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".^[2] Moravian Christians began to
   illuminate Christmas trees with candles,^[5] which were often replaced by
   Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.^[6] Today, there is
   a wide variety of traditional and modern ornaments, such as garlands,
   baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or star might be placed at the
   top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem,
   respectively, from the Nativity.^[7]^[8] Edible items such as gingerbread,
   chocolate, and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from
   the tree's branches with ribbons. The Christmas tree has been historically
   regarded as a custom of the Lutheran Churches and only in 1982 did the
   Catholic Church erect the Vatican Christmas Tree.^[9]

   In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected
   on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve
   depending on the country;^[10] customs of the same faith hold that the two
   traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree,
   are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day,
   Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some
   denominations.^[10]^[11]

   The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the "Yule-tree", especially
   in discussions of its folkloric origins.^[12]^[13]^[14]

History[edit]

  Origin of the modern Christmas tree[edit]

   [IMG]Martin Luther is depicted with his family and friends in front of a
   Christmas tree on Christmas Eve

   Modern Christmas trees originated in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia) during the
   Renaissance in early modern Europe.^[2]^[3] Its 16th-century origins are
   sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who
   is said to have first added lighted candles to an evergreen
   tree.^[15]^[16]^[17] The Christmas tree was first recorded to be used by
   German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a
   Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1539, under
   the leadership of the Protestant Reformer Martin Bucer.^[18]^[19] The
   Moravian Christians put lighted candles on those trees."^[5]^[20] The
   earliest known firmly dated representation of a Christmas tree is on the
   keystone sculpture of a private home in Turckheim, Alsace (then part of
   the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, today France), with the date
--
  Possible predecessors[edit]

   Modern Christmas trees have been related to the "tree of paradise" of
   medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration
   and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree
   decorated with apples (representing fruit from the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil and thus to the original sin that Christ took away) and
   round white wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as
   a setting for the play.^[6] Like the Christmas crib, the Paradise tree was
   later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as
   shiny red balls.^[13]^[14]^[22]^[23]^[24]^[25]

     Fir trees decorated with apples served as the central prop for the
     paradise play, a kind of folk religious drama often performed on
     December 24 These props were called paradise trees, and some researchers
     believe they were the forerunners of the Christmas tree

   Portugal. The Regiment of the local high-Sacristans of the Cistercian
   Order refers to what may be considered the oldest references to the
   Christmas tree: "Note on how to put the Christmas branch, scilicet: On the
   Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you
   shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of
--
   the candle of the high altar."^[27]

   [IMG]Yggdrasil, in Norse cosmology, is an immense and central sacred tree.

   Other sources have offered a connection between the symbolism of the first
   documented Christmas trees in Germany around 1600 and the trees of
   pre-Christian traditions, though this claim has been disputed.^[28]
   According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, "The use of evergreen trees,
   wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the
   ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the
   pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the
   Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at
   the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the
   birds during Christmas time."^[29]

   It is commonly believed that ancient Romans used to decorate their houses
   with evergreen trees to celebrate Saturnalia,^[30] although there are no
   historical records of that.^[31] In the poem Epithalamium by Catullus, he
   tells of the gods decorating the home of Peleus with trees, including
   laurel and cypress. Later Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom speak of
   the use of evergreen trees to adorn Christian houses.^[32]

   The Vikings and Saxons worshiped trees.^[30] The story of Saint Boniface
   cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century
   among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that
   an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how
   its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to
   heaven.^[33]^[a]

   Customs of erecting decorated trees in winter time can be traced to
   Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era guilds in Northern Germany and
   Livonia. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas
   Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the
   apprentices and children. In Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia), in
   1441, 1442, 1510, and 1514, the Brotherhood of Blackheads erected a tree
   for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now Tallinn) and Riga. On
   the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree
   was taken to the Town Hall Square, where the members of the brotherhood
   danced around it.^[34]

   A Bremen guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with
   "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels, and paper flowers" was erected in the
   guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected
--
   established tradition of setting up a decorated spruce at the market
   square, where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first
   sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

   After the Protestant Reformation, such trees are seen in the houses of
   upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic Christmas
   cribs. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes

   tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the
   present-day, the churches and homes of Protestants and Catholics feature

    Adoption by European nobility[edit]

   [IMG]German Christmas tree, book illustration (1888)

   In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility
   and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Introduced by Fanny von
   Arnstein and popularized by Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg the
   Christmas tree reached Vienna in 1814 during the Congress of Vienna, and
   the custom spread across Austria in the following years.^[41] In France,
   the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchesse d'Orléans.
   In Denmark, a newspaper company claims that the first attested Christmas
   tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the
   aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to
   the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1865. He had published a
   fairy tale called The Fir-Tree in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir tree
   being used as a Christmas tree.^[42]

   Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas
   tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained
   confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The
   custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way
--
   Vienna.

   In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of
   German culture and of Gemütlichkeit, especially among emigrants
   overseas.^[43]

   A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's
   decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals
   during the Franco-Prussian War. Only at the start of the 20th century did
   Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit
   form.^[44]

   Early Slovenian custom dating back to around the 17th century was to
   suspend the tree either upright or upside-down above the well, a corner of
   the dinner table, in the backyard, or from the fences, modestly decorated
   with fruits or not decorated at all. German brewer Peter Luelsdorf brought
   the first Christmas tree of the current tradition to Slovenia in 1845. He
   set it up in his small brewery inn in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital.
   German officials, craftsmen and merchants quickly spread the tradition
   among the bourgeois population. The trees were typically decorated with
   walnuts, golden apples, carobs, and candles. At first the Catholic
   majority rejected this custom because they considered it a typical
--
   in Ljubljana already in 1859. However, this tradition was almost unknown
   to the rural population until World War I, after which everyone started
   decorating trees. Spruce trees have a centuries-long tradition in
   Slovenia. After World War II during Yugoslavia period, trees set in the
   public places (towns, squares, and markets) were politically replaced with
   fir trees, a symbol of socialism and Slavic mythology strongly associated
   with loyalty, courage, and dignity. However, spruce retained its
   popularity in Slovenian homes during those years and came back to public

   [IMG]An engraving published in the 1840s of Queen Victoria and Prince
   Albert created a craze for Christmas trees.^[49]

   Although the tradition of decorating churches and homes with evergreens at
   Christmas was long established,^[50] the custom of decorating an entire
   small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. The
   German-born Queen Charlotte introduced a Christmas tree at a party she
   gave for children in 1800.^[51] The custom did not at first spread much
   beyond the royal family.^[b] Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with
   it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. In her journal for
   Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote:^[53]

     After dinner [...] we then went into the drawing room near the dining
     room [...] There were two large round tables on which were placed two
     trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being
     placed round the trees [...]

   After Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the
   custom became even more widespread^[54] as wealthier middle-class families
   followed the fashion. In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes
   clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and
   gift-giving.^[55] An illustrated book, The Christmas Tree, describing
--
   seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in
   the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the
   Christmas trees is not less than ours used to be".^[59] A boost to the
   trend was given in 1848^[60] when The Illustrated London News,^[61] in a
   report picked up by other papers,^[62] described the trees in Windsor
   Castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family,
   on its cover. In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was
   widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert
   alluding casually to them,^[63] as well as reporting the accidental death
   of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas
   tree.^[64] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a
   report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every
   family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still
   the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".^[65]

   them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up
   specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums "who had never
   seen a Christmas tree" would enjoy one that year.^[66] Anti-German
   sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity^[67] but the
   effect was short-lived,^[68] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas
   trees had spread to all classes.^[69] In 1933 a restriction on the
   importation of foreign trees led to the "rapid growth of a new industry"
   as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially
   viable due to the size of demand.^[70] By 2013 the number of trees grown
   in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately eight million^[71]

   small coniferous tree.^[72] These pale-colored ornaments differ in height
   from 20 cm (7.9 in) to 3 meters (9.8 ft). Chichilakis are most common in
   the Guria and Samegrelo regions of Georgia near the Black Sea, but they

      The Bahamas[edit]

   The earliest reference of Christmas trees being used in The Bahamas dates
   to January 1864 and is associated with the Anglican Sunday Schools in
   Nassau, New Providence: "After prayers and a sermon from the Rev. R.
   Swann, the teachers and children of St. Agnes', accompanied by those of
   St. Mary's, marched to the Parsonage of Rev. J. H. Fisher, in front of
   which a large Christmas tree had been planted for their gratification. The
   delighted little ones formed a circle around it singing "Come follow me to
   the Christmas tree"."^[74] The gifts decorated the trees as ornaments and
   the children were given tickets with numbers that matched the gifts. This
   appears to be the typical way of decorating the trees in the 1860s
   Bahamas. In the Christmas of 1864, there was a Christmas tree put up in
   the Ladies Saloon in the Royal Victoria Hotel for the respectable children
   of the neighbourhood. The tree was ornamented with gifts for the children
   who formed a circle about it and sung the song "Oats and Beans". The gifts
   were later given to the children in the name of Santa Claus.^[75]

   garrison the colony against American attack. General Friedrich Adolf
   Riedesel and his wife, the Baroness von Riedesel, held a Christmas party
   for the officers at Sorel, Quebec, delighting their guests with a fir tree
   decorated with candles and fruits.^[76]

   The Christmas tree became very common in the United States of America in
   the early nineteenth century. Dating from late 1812 or early 1813, the
   watercolor sketchbooks of John Lewis Krimmel contain perhaps the earliest
   depictions of a Christmas tree in American art, representing a family
   celebrating Christmas Eve in the Moravian tradition.^[77] The first
   published image of a Christmas tree appeared in 1836 as the frontispiece
   to The Stranger's Gift by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the
   Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition
   of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, titled "New Year's Day", by Catherine
   Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her
   mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British royal family with their
   Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in The Illustrated
   London News December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas
   1850, in Godey's Lady's Book. Godey's copied it exactly, except for the
--
   engraving into an American scene.^[78] The republished Godey's image
   became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen
   Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince
   Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, "the first
   influential American Christmas tree".^[79] Folk-culture historian Alfred
   Lewis Shoemaker states, "In all of America there was no more important
   medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than Godey's
   Lady's Book". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting
   up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.^[78]

   House Christmas tree in 1889.^[80]

   Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to
   that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims
   that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at
   the Noden-Reed House,^[81] while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is
   also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly
   erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of Lancaster,
   Pennsylvania, recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading
   Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.^[82]
   Other accounts credit Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston, for
   being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a
   Christmas tree.^[83] In 1847, August Imgard, a German immigrant living in
   Wooster, Ohio cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the
   Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his
   house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.^[84]
   German immigrant Charles Minnigerode accepted a position as a professor of

   1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of
   the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of
   decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St.
   George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted
   Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.^[85] An 1853 article
   on Christmas customs in Pennsylvania defines them as mostly "German in
   origin", including the Christmas tree, which is "planted in a flower pot
   filled with earth, and its branches are covered with presents, chiefly of
   confectionary, for the younger members of the family." The article

   When Edward H. Johnson was vice president of the Edison Electric Light
   Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known

   1882. Johnson became the "Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights".^[87]

   The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune O Tannenbaum begin
   "O Christmas tree...", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the German
   word Tannenbaum (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for
   which is instead Weihnachtsbaum.

    Public Christmas trees[edit]

   Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns,
   and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as
   the Macy's Great Tree in Atlanta (since 1948), the Rockefeller Center
   Christmas Tree in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at Victoria
   Square in Adelaide.

   The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real

   In some cities, a charity event called the Festival of Trees is organized,

   The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end
   of hostilities. After the signing of the Armistice in 1918 the city of
   Manchester sent a tree, and £500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the
   children of the much-bombarded town of Lille in northern France.^[95] In
   some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in
   Trafalgar Square in London, where the City of Oslo, Norway presents a tree
   to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support
   of Norwegian resistance during the Second World War; in Boston, where the
   tree is a gift from the province of Nova Scotia, in thanks for rapid
   deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 ammunition ship explosion
   that leveled the city of Halifax; and in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the
   main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of Bergen, in
   thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen
   from Nazi occupation.^[96] Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to
   Washington, D.C. as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and
   as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the

  Setting up and taking down[edit]

   [IMG]Adding decorations to tree

   Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with
   specific dates; liturgically, this is done through the hanging of the
   greens ceremony.^[98] In many areas, it has become customary to set up
   one's Christmas tree on Advent Sunday, the first day of the Advent
   season.^[99]^[100] Traditionally, however, Christmas trees were not
   brought in and decorated until the evening of Christmas Eve (24 December),
   the end of the Advent season and the start of the twelve days of

   Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood,
   or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first
   decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries
   in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made
   in Lauscha, Germany, and also garlands of glass beads and tin figures that
   could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations fueled the
   production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay
   molds.

   Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used as
   Christmas tree decorations. Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced
   later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments
   were a specialty of the glass factories in the Thuringian Forest,
--
   coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
   Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom,
   fairy lights) is commonly done. A tree-topper, sometimes an angel but more
   frequently a star, completes the decoration.

   In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping
   strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance
   of a snow-laden tree.

   In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,
   flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There
   were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the
   1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

Symbolism and interpretations[edit]

   The earliest legend of the origin of a fir tree becoming a Christian
   symbol dates back to 723 AD, involving Saint Boniface as he was
   evangelizing Germany.^[107] It is said that at a pagan gathering in
   Geismar where a group of people dancing under a decorated oak tree were
   about to sacrifice a baby in the name of Thor, Saint Boniface took an axe
   and called on the name of Jesus.^[107] In one swipe, he managed to take
   down the entire oak tree, to the crowd's astonishment.^[107] Behind the
   fallen tree was a baby fir tree.^[107] Boniface said, "let this tree be
   the symbol of the true God, its leaves are ever green and will not die."
   The tree's needles pointed to heaven and it was shaped triangularly to
   represent the Holy Trinity.^[107]

   When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the
   top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem.^[7]^[108] It became
   popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order
   to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of
   Jesus.^[8] Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of
   Christmas, the evergreen Christmas tree symbolizes eternal life; the
   candles or lights on the tree represent Christ as the light of the
   world.^[6]^[109]

   Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and
   50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000
   growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same
   year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas
   trees.^[110] By 2016 that had climbed to $2.04 billion for natural trees
   and a further $1.86 billion for artificial trees. In Europe, 75 million
   trees worth €2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) are harvested annually.^[111]

     * Norway spruce Picea abies (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
     * Silver fir Abies alba
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana

     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Norfolk Island pine Araucaria heterophylla
     * Paraná pine Araucaria angustifolia (when young, resembles a Pine tree)

   Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional
   conifers are sometimes used, such as giant sequoia, Leyland cypress,
   Monterey cypress, and eastern juniper. Various types of spruce tree are
   also used for Christmas trees (including the blue spruce and, less
   commonly, the white spruce); but spruces begin to lose their needles
   rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making
   decorating uncomfortable. Virginia pine is still available on some tree
   farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is
   faded. The long-needled eastern white pine is also used there, though it
   is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to
   its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult
   with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes
   used, particularly in Oceania, and in Australia, some species of the
   genera Casuarina and Allocasuarina are also occasionally used as Christmas
   trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata Monterey
   pine. Adenanthos sericeus or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in
   southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. Hemlock species are
   generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor
   needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and
   ornaments.

   Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold
   live with roots and soil, often from a plant nursery, to be stored at
   nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often
--
   sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly,
   the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment
   of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's
   health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree
   out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put
   back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a
   large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the
   survival rate of these trees is low.^[112] However, when done properly,
   replanting provides higher survival rates.^[113]

   European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared
   trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often
   wild-harvested on public lands)^[114] there is a preference for
   close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang
   decorations.

   In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but
   now almost all are commercially grown on tree farms. Almost all Christmas
   trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they
   are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According
   to the United States Department of Agriculture's agriculture census for
   2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree
   market in America, 5,717.09 square kilometres (1,412,724 acres) were
   planted in Christmas trees.^[115]

   The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a 2-metre (7 ft) tree
   takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between eight
   and twelve years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from
   older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold
   to Christmas tree farms at an age of three to four years. The remaining
   development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as
   well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree
   farmer.^[116]

  Artificial trees[edit]

   Main article: Artificial Christmas tree
   [IMG]An artificial Christmas tree

   The first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the
   19th century,^[117]^[118]^[self-published source?] though earlier examples
   exist.^[119] These "trees" were made using goose feathers that were dyed
   green,^[117] as one response by Germans to continued deforestation.^[118]
   Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 5-centimeter
   (2 in) tree to a large 2.5-meter (98 in) tree sold in department stores
   during the 1920s.^[120] Often, the tree branches were tipped with
   artificial red berries which acted as candle holders.^[121]

   Over the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved
   and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created
   the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.^[122]
   Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree,^[118]
   first manufactured in Chicago in 1958,^[123] and later in Manitowoc,
   Wisconsin, where the majority of the trees were produced.^[124] Most
   modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used
   packaging materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC).^[118] Approximately
   10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin;
   despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or
   biodegradable.^[125]

   Other trends developed also in the early 2000s. Optical fiber Christmas
   trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas
   tree.^[126] One Dallas-based company offers "holographic mylar" trees in
   many hues.^[119] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as
   cardboard,^[127] glass,^[128] ceramic or other materials can be found in
   use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became
   popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing
   gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in
   retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.^[129]

   Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th
   century.^[118] Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are
   more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their
   natural alternative.^[118] They are also considered much safer,^[130] as
   natural trees can be a significant fire hazard. Between 2001 and 2007,
   artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to
   17.4 million.^[131] Currently, it is estimated that around 58% of
   Christmas trees used in the United States are artificial, while numbers in
   the United Kingdom are indicated to be around 66%.^[132]

Environmental issues[edit]

   The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing.
   Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more
   environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.^[131] However,
   trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, claim that
   the PVC used in Christmas trees is chemically and mechanically stable and
   does not affect human health and has excellent recyclable
   properties.^[133] Live trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted
   in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for
   wildlife.^[134] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock
   farmers who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are
   excellent fodder.^[135] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops
   can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of
   pesticides.^[136] Concerns have been raised by arborists about people
   cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana for
   Christmas trees.^[137]

   Real or cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and
   used as mulch, wildlife habitat, or used to prevent
   erosion.^[138]^[139]^[140] Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no
   more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb
   while growing.^[141] However, emissions can occur from farming activities
   and transportation. An independent life-cycle assessment study, conducted
   by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural
   tree will generate 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) of greenhouse gases every year (based
   on purchasing 5 km (3.1 mi) from home) whereas the artificial tree will
   produce 48.3 kg (106 lb) over its lifetime.^[142] Some people use living
   Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life
   cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented
   from local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while
   purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local
   tree adoption or urban reforestation services.^[143] Smaller and younger
   trees may be replanted after each season, with the following year running
   up to the next Christmas allowing the tree to carry out further growth.

   The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of
   concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study
   found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from
   lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major
   health risks to young children exist.^[144] A 2008 United States
   Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial
   Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.^[145] The report determined that
   of the fifty million artificial trees in the United States approximately
   twenty million were nine or more years old, the point where dangerous lead
   contamination levels are reached.^[145] A professional study on the
   life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed
   that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least twenty years to
   leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas
   tree.^[142]

   anti-religious campaign.^[146]^[147]^[88] The League of Militant Atheists
   encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among
   them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays,
   including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be
   the 31st of each month as a replacement.^[148] With the Christmas tree
   being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation,
   people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's
   trees.^[88]^[149] In 1935, the tree was brought back as New Year tree and
   became a secular, not a religious holiday.

   Pope John Paul II introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in
   1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the
   centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican Christmas Tree has become
   an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,^[150] and in 2005
   Pope Benedict XVI spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations
   in Catholic homes.^[151] In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree
   a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of
   life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and
   it reminds Christians of the "tree of life",^[152] an image of Christ, the
   supreme gift of God to humanity.^[153] In the previous year he said:
   "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds
   us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the
   desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand
   down in time the true meaning of Christmas."^[154] The Catholic Church's
   official Book of Blessings has a service for the blessing of the Christmas
   tree in a home.^[155] The Episcopal Church in The Anglican Family Prayer
   Book, which has the imprimatur of The Rt. Rev. Catherine S. Roskam of the
   Anglican Communion, has long had a ritual titled Blessing of a Christmas
   Tree, as well as Blessing of a Crèche, for use in the church and the home;
   family services and public liturgies for the blessing of Christmas trees
   are common in other Christian denominations as well.^[156]^[157]

   Chrismon trees, which find their origin in the Lutheran Christian
   tradition though now used in many Christian denominations such as the
   Catholic Church and Methodist Church, are used to decorate churches during
   the liturgical season of Advent; during the period of Christmastide,
   Christian churches display the traditional Christmas tree in their
   sanctuaries.^[158]

   In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the
   Boston Common a "Holiday Tree" rather than a "Christmas Tree".^[159] The

       the apples often used as decorations set up a symbolic relation to the

        6. Christmas Tree Trivia and Facts

   The history of Christmas trees has many roots, ranging from the use of
   evergreens in ancient Egypt and Rome to the German traditions of candlelit
   trees that made its way to America in the 1800s. Discover the history of
   the Christmas tree, from the earliest winter solstice celebrations to
   Queen Victoria’s decorating habits and the annual lighting of the
   Rockefeller Center tree in New York City.

How Did Christmas Trees Start?

   Long before the advent of Christianity, plants and trees that remained
   green all year had a special meaning for people in the winter. Just as
   people today decorate their homes during the festive season with pine,
   spruce, and fir trees, many ancient peoples hung evergreen boughs over
   their doors and windows. In many countries it was believed that evergreens
   would keep away witches, ghosts, evil spirits, and illness.

Christmas Trees From Germany

   Germany is credited with starting the Christmas tree tradition—as we now
   know it—by the 16th century  when sources record devout Christians
   bringing decorated trees into their homes. Some built Christmas pyramids
   of wood and decorated them with evergreens and candles if wood was scarce.

   It is a widely held belief that Martin Luther, the 16th-century Protestant
   reformer, first added lighted candles to a tree. According to a common
   version of the story, walking home one winter evening, Luther was awed by
   the stars twinkling amidst evergreens. To recapture the scene for his
   family, he erected a tree in the main room and wired its branches with
   lighted candles.

Who Brought Christmas Trees to America?

   Most 19th-century Americans found Christmas trees an oddity. The first
   records of Christmas trees being cut for display comes from the 1820s in
   Pennsylvania’s German community, although trees may have been a tradition
   there even earlier. As early as 1747, Moravian Germans in Pennsylvania had
   a community tree in the form of a wooden pyramid decorated with candles.
   But, as late as the 1840s, Christmas trees were seen as pagan symbols and
   not accepted by most Americans.

   It is not surprising that, like many other festive Christmas customs, the
   tree was adopted so late in America. New England’s first Puritan leaders
   viewed Christmas celebrations as unholy. The pilgrims’s second governor,
   William Bradford, wrote that he tried hard to stamp out “pagan mockery” of

   An illustration from a December 1848 edition of the Illustrated London
   News shows Queen Victoria and her family surrounding a Christmas tree.

   In 1846, the popular royals, Queen Victoria and her German Prince, Albert,
   were sketched in the Illustrated London News standing with their children
   around a Christmas tree. Unlike the previous royal family, Victoria was
   very popular with her subjects, and what was done at court immediately
   became fashionable—not only in Britain, but with fashion-conscious East
   Coast American Society. The Christmas tree had arrived.

   By the 1890s Christmas ornaments were arriving from Germany and Christmas
   tree popularity was on the rise around the U.S. It was noted that
   Europeans used small trees about four feet in height, while Americans
   liked their Christmas trees to extend from floor to ceiling.

   The early 20th century saw Americans decorating their trees mainly with
   homemade ornaments, while many German Americans continued to use apples,
   nuts and marzipan cookies. Stringed popcorn was added to trees' decoration
   after being dyed bright colors and interlaced with berries and nuts.
   Electricity brought about Christmas lights, making it possible for
   Christmas trees to glow for days on end. With this, Christmas trees began
   to appear in town squares across the country and having a Christmas tree
   in the home became an American tradition.

Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree

   The Rockefeller Center tree is located at Rockefeller Center, west of
   Fifth Avenue from 47th through 51st Streets in New York City.

   The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree dates back to the Depression era,
   with the first tree placed in 1931. It was a small unadorned tree set up
   by construction workers at the center of the construction site. Two years
   later, another tree was placed there, this time with lights.

   These days, the giant Rockefeller Center tree is laden with over 50,000
   Christmas lights. The tallest tree displayed at Rockefeller Center arrived
   in 1999. It was a Norway Spruce that measured 100 feet tall and hailed
   from Killingworth, Connecticut.

   Christmas Trees in Canada
   German settlers began migrating to Canada from the United States in the
   1700s. They brought Canada’s first Christmas trees and, in later
   generations, gingerbread houses and Advent calendars. When Queen
   Victoria’s German husband, Prince Albert, put up a Christmas tree at
   Windsor Castle in 1848, Christmas trees became a widely popular tradition
   throughout England, the United States and Canada.

   Christmas Trees in Mexico
   In most Mexican homes the principal holiday adornment is el Nacimiento
   (Nativity scene). However, a decorated Christmas tree may be incorporated
   in the Nacimiento or set up elsewhere in the home. As purchase of a
   natural pine represents a luxury commodity to most Mexican families, the
   typical arbolito (little tree) is often an artificial one, a bare branch
   cut from a copal tree (Bursera microphylla) or some type of shrub
   collected from the countryside.

   Christmas Trees in Greenland
   Since icy Greenland lacks large native forests, most Christmas trees are
   imported. They are decorated with candles and bright ornaments.

   Christmas Trees in Guatemala
   The Christmas tree has joined the Nacimiento as a popular ornament because
   of the large German population in Guatemala.

   Christmas Trees in Brazil
   Although Christmas falls during the summer in most of Brazil, sometimes
   pine trees are decorated with little pieces of cotton that represent
   falling snow.

   Christmas Trees in Ireland
   Christmas trees are bought anytime in December and decorated with colored
   lights, tinsel, and baubles. Some people favor the angel on top of the
   tree, others the star. The house is decorated with garlands, candles,
   holly, and ivy. Wreaths and mistletoe are hung on the door.

   Christmas Trees in Sweden
   Most people buy Christmas trees well before Christmas Eve, but it’s not
   common to take the tree inside and decorate it until just a few days
   before. Evergreen trees are decorated with stars, sunbursts and snowflakes
   made from straw. Other decorations include colorful wooden animals and
   straw centerpieces.

   Christmas Trees in Norway
   Norwegians often take a trip to the woods to select a Christmas tree, a
   trip that their grandfathers probably did not make. The Christmas tree was
   not introduced into Norway from Germany until the latter half of the 19th
   century; to the country districts it came even later. Many families
   decorate their trees on ‘Little Christmas Eve’—December 23. A Norwegian
   ritual known as “circling the Christmas tree” follows, where everyone
   joins hands to form a ring around the tree and then walks around it
   singing carols.

   Some houses even have a ceppo for each child in the family.

   As mentioned above, some Lutheran traditions credit Martin Luther with
   placing the first lighted candles on a Christmas tree.

   Another legend says that in the early 16th century, people in Germany
   combined two customs that had been practiced in different countries around
   the globe. The Paradise tree (a fir tree decorated with apples)
   represented the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. The Christmas
   Light, a small, pyramid-like frame, usually decorated with glass balls,
   tinsel and a candle on top, was a symbol of the birth of Christ as the
   Light of the World. Changing the tree’s apples to tinsel balls and cookies
   and combining this new tree with the light placed on top, the Germans
   created the tree that many of us know today.

   The modern Tannenbaum (Christmas trees) is traditionally decorated in
   secret with lights, tinsel and ornaments by parents and then lit and
   revealed on Christmas Eve with cookies, nuts and gifts under its branches.

   Christmas Trees in China
   More than 80 percent of the world’s artificial Christmas trees are made in

   light” decorated with paper chains and lanterns.

   Christmas Trees in Japan
   For most of the Japanese who celebrate Christmas, it’s purely a secular
   holiday devoted to the love of their children. Christmas trees are
   decorated with small toys, dolls, paper ornaments, gold paper fans and

   branches. One of the most popular ornaments is the origami crane. Japanese
   children have exchanged thousands of folded paper “birds of peace” with

   Most Christmas trees are cut weeks before they get to a retail outlet.

   In 1912, what were likely the first major community Christmas trees in the
   United States were erected in Boston, New York City and Hartford, Conn.

   Christmas trees generally take six to eight years to mature.

   Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including Hawaii and Alaska.

   Ninety-eight percent of all natural Christmas trees are grown on farms.

   More than 1,000,000 acres of land have been planted with Christmas trees.

   On average, as many as 1,500 Christmas trees are planted per acre.

   You should never burn your Christmas tree in the fireplace. It can

   Eucalyptus are one of the state’s most controversial trees. A Monterey Bay
                reserve may be a model for how to replace them.

The Elkhorn Slough Reserve is pioneering methods to restore native habitats

   Fresh tree stumps the size of dining tables line the road at the Elkhorn
   Slough Reserve, the remains of hulking eucalyptus trees that blanketed the
   ground in a thick layer of aromatic wood chips. Nothing grows in the
   wreckage, but about 40 yards away, a grove of young oak trees flourishes.

   1990s and planted well over 10,000 acorns. In a few decades, the roadside

   restored oak savanna beside it.

   Paul hopes the restoration efforts at Elkhorn Slough will help quell
   public opposition to the removal of the eucalyptus — an invasive tree
   native to Australia that has become a California icon, and a shelter for
   migrating birds and Monarch butterflies, but must be removed because they

   At the Elkhorn Slough Reserve — home to a vast array of birds, marine
   mammals, amphibians and fish — thirsty eucalyptus trees leave the wetlands
   more vulnerable to drought and problems with water quality. To save this
   vital habitat, the reserve has made removing the trees a priority in areas
   where they are doing harm.

   But some community members have objected. In 2015, when the Elkhorn Slough
   Reserve proposed chopping down more than 1,200 trees across 50 acres by
   2025, staff received angry comments from locals, many concerned that
   important Monarch butterfly and bird habitat would disappear.

   Similar objections have erupted around felling other eucalyptus groves,
   such as the removal of 31 trees on private land around Rodeo Creek in
   Santa Cruz, which was just completed. “I had no idea how much wildlife
   lived in the eucalyptus before I moved here,” said Santa Cruz resident

   stacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant. “We’re not going to remove that at
   all, ever.”

   At another restoration site where eucalyptus trees were downed in August
   2022, native plants sprout from holes in a foot-thick layer of eucalyptus
   wood chips. The scene challenges a common belief that eucalyptus is

   “There was a historic stream that was present on this site that hadn’t

   After the trees were felled, the stream resurfaced during last winter’s

   Some important tree species native to the northwestern states in the U.S.
   are no longer growing well because of climate change.

   As conditions change in states such as Washington, Oregon and California,
   trees such as the Douglas fir, Western red cedar, giant sequoia and
   redwood may need to move -- with the help of humans.

   Some of the trees do not do well when temperatures rise. Others suffer
   during times of drought. The goal is to move the trees to areas where the
   climate might more suitable.

   Forest scientists are generally in favor of moving the trees so they do
   not die out. However, not all of the scientists agree on the best way to
   do it.

   There are three ways to move trees: assisted population migration,
   assisted species migration and range expansion.

   Assisted population migration involves scientists moving a tree’s seeds
   within its current growing range. Assisted species migration involves
   scientists moving a species far from its existing area. In this case, that
   would include moving redwoods and sequoias from California to Washington.

   The third way, range expansion, moves trees just outside their current
   growing range. Each way has different results for the trees and other
   animals and insects that depend on the trees.

   Michael Case is a forest ecologist at the Nature Conservancy in Virginia.

   He said the risk of failure increases “whenever you plant something in an
   area where it is not locally found.” He said the risk is not only to the
   trees. There is also the risk of causing problems in the ecosystem.

   Case is working on an assisted population migration program with Douglas
   fir and Western hemlock trees. He is testing whether the trees, originally
   from drier parts of the northwest, can do well in western Washington where
   there is a drought. His organization believes that assisted population
--
   Douglas Tallamy is a professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the
   University of Delaware. He said one worry about species migration is that
   local caterpillars might not eat the leaves of trees that are new to the
   area. The caterpillars serve as food for birds and other animals, so they
   must have a good food source.

   Although the concerns are documented, the city of Portland, Oregon, is
   working on a species migration project for 11 tree species. The project
   includes three oak trees: California black oak, canyon live oak and
   interior live oak. Tallamy said oak trees are among the most important in
   North America. “When you move them out of range,” he said, “the things
   that are adapted to eating them no longer have access to them.”

   In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
   usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of
   a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
   plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
   wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
   also trees.

   Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety
   of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
   way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of
   tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are
   gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching
   several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million
   years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees
   in the world.

   A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground
   by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and
   vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
   For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a
   protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out
   widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients
   from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and
   shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
   convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the
   tree's growth and development.

   Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but
   some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
   Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce
   spores instead.

   timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food
   as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests are
   shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available
   for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have
   always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play
   a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Definition

   [IMG]Diagram of secondary growth in a eudicot or coniferous tree showing
   idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added
   in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots.

   Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally
   recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in
   common language.^[1]^[2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with
   the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the
   photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.^[3]
   Trees are also typically defined by height,^[4] with smaller plants from
   0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,^[5] so the minimum
   height of a tree is only loosely defined.^[4] Large herbaceous plants such
   as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.^[2]^[6]

   A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk
   formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by
   growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the
   growing tip.^[4]^[7] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as
   palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their
   height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered
   trees under a slightly looser definition;^[8] while the Joshua tree,
   bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood
   with growth rings,^[9]^[10] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying
--
   despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem
   in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in
   dicotyledonous trees.^[12]

   Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for
   instance, as those plants which yield lumber.^[13]

   film, see The Saplings. For the episode, see Saplings (Weeds).

   The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different
   groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for
   sunlight.^[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,^[15] some reaching
   several thousand years old.^[16] Several trees are among the oldest
   organisms now living.^[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker
   stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and
--
   spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar
   growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;^[5]
   but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,^[18]
   made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under
   harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
   The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in
   response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example
   of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the
   number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living
   plant species.^[19]^[20] The greatest number of these grow in tropical
   regions; many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by
   botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.^[21]

   [IMG]Tall herbaceous monocotyledonous plants such as banana lack secondary
   growth, but are trees under the broadest definition.

   The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods. Of the rest,
   many are gymnosperms or softwood trees;^[22] these include conifers,
   cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales, which produce seeds which are not
   enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many
   have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.^[23] Most angiosperm trees
   are eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain
   two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old
   lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots;
   these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,^[24] while trees
   such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

   Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this
   supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows
   water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant,
   and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees,
   as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the
   xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the
   leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.^[25] The
   three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are
   integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living
   cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium
   allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
   Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also

   species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small
   leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.^[5] The crown is
   the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,^[29] while
   the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is
   known as the canopy.^[30] A sapling is a young tree.^[31]

   Many tall palms are herbaceous^[32] monocots, which do not undergo
   secondary growth and never produce wood.^[9]^[10] In many tall palms, the
   terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have
   unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree
   ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20
   metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which

   The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04
   trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics,
   0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the
   coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than
   previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over
   400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least
   because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate
   suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5
   billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human
   agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by
   46%.^[34]^[35]^[36]^[37] There are approximately 64,100 known tree species
   in the world. With 43% of all tree species, South America has the highest
   biodiversity, followed by Eurasia (22%), Africa (16%), North America
   (15%), and Oceania (11%).^[38]

   In suitable environments, such as the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland,
   or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand,
   forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end of
   a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by
   taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a
   forest canopy.^[39]^[40]

   Main article: Root

   The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and
   nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for
   reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.
   The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge
--
   taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots
   branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper
   layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and
   the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are
   single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil
--

   In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are
   known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree
   roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish
   in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and
   associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus
   from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of
   photosynthesis from the tree.^[51] The hyphae of the fungus can link
   different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and
   signals from one place to another.^[52] The fungus promotes growth of the
   roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can
   also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate
   heavy metals within its tissues.^[53] Fossil evidence shows that roots
   have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic,
--
   dry land.^[54]

   [IMG]Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)

   Some trees such as Alder (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship
   with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from
   the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules
   on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree
   to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to
   thrive.^[55] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule
   formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.^[56]

   It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their
   root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the
   inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal
   tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by
   injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking
   for its presence in neighbouring trees.^[57]

   The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree
   species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial
   roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of
   the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical
   stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that
   loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the
   mud.^[58] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.^[59] Many
   large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the
   trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide
   stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in
   tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the
   surface.^[60]

   Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in
   order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of
   excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are
--

   The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground,
   enabling the tree to overtop other plants and outcompete them for
   light.^[61] It also transports water and nutrients from the roots to the
   aerial parts of the tree, and distributes the food produced by the leaves
   to all other parts, including the roots.^[62]

--
   London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large
   flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off
   in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in
   circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In
   some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin
   which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is
   a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis)
   contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.^[62] Large
   tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales,
   Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos
   have different structures and outer coverings.^[64]

--
   the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery
   of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the
   tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried
   from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the
   growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards
   and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of
   nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were
   killed by this disease.^[65]

   The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in
   the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to
   other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some
   of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by
   parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for
--
   cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in
   colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts
   of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively
   converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The
   conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species. Heartwood
--
   of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the
   xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin,
   a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a
   horizontal core will show concentric circles of lighter or darker wood –
   tree rings.^[68] These rings are the annual growth rings^[69]^[70] There
   may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are
   vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the
   wood.^[68] Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright
   for many years.^[71]

--
   growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when
   conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive
   period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active
   growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the
   tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and
--
   a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand
   when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the
   leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the
   eucalyptus, have "naked buds" with no protective scales and some conifers,
   such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets
--
   unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms)
   have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.^[72] In some
   tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas
   growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss
   of early foliage to insect predators.^[73]
--
   the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium
   layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.^[74]
   Eventually the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no
   taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.^[75]

  Leaves
--

   Leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on
   the tree in such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without
   shading each other.^[76] They are an important investment by the tree and
   may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to
   discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes
--
   predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or
   entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The
   needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to
   those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments
   where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water
   availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher
   altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such
   as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling
   them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions
   deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get
   shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make
--
   called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the
   petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats
   to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their
   leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be
   replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other
   tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves
   annually, such as at the start of the dry season.^[77] Many deciduous
   trees flower before the new leaves emerge.^[78] A few trees do not have
   true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance
   such as Phylloclades – modified stem structures^[79] – as seen in the

   Trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects. Many
   angiosperm trees are insect pollinated. Wind pollination may take
   advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground.^[81] Trees use a
   variety of methods of seed dispersal. Some rely on wind, with winged or

   Main article: Seed

   Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary
   greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but
   the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest
   tree seeds.^[83] The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the
   many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their
   offspring.

   [IMG]Wind dispersed seed of elm (Ulmus), ash (Fraxinus) and maple (Acer)

   For a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light. If seeds
   only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated
   saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from
   flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to
   aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with
   blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The
   kapok tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.^[84]

   The seeds of conifers, the largest group of gymnosperms, are enclosed in a
--
   to high temperatures.^[87]

   The flame tree Delonix regia does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds
   through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart
   explosively on drying.^[84] The miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees
   produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the
   seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some
   species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start
   germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.^[88]^[89] These
   float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and
   successfully take root.^[84]

   animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the

   Further information: Evolutionary history of plants

   The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew
   in forests in the Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been
   Wattieza, fossils of which have been found in New York state in 2007
   dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to
   this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.^[96] Both of
   these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be
   links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic
--
   which took place about 319 million years ago.^[97] Ginkgophyta was once a
   widespread diverse group^[98] of which the only survivor is the maidenhair
   tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is
   virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic
   deposits.^[99]
--
   During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the conifers flourished
   and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats.
   Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the
   Cretaceous period. These began to displace the conifers during the
   Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the
   globe.^[100] When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first
   of four glacial periods occurred, the forests retreated as the ice
   advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been
   covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next glacial
   period.^[100]

   provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including
   animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the
   ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth,
   leaf litter, and decaying wood that provide other habitat.^[103]^[104]
   Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help
--
   maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.^[105]

   Many species of tree support their own specialised invertebrates. In their
   natural habitats, 284 different species of insect have been found on the
   English oak (Quercus robur)^[106] and 306 species of invertebrate on the
   Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua).^[107] Non-native tree species provide
   a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the
   sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has
--
   of lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.^[108] Trees differ
   ecologically in the ease with which they can be found by herbivores. Tree
   apparency varies with a tree's size and semiochemical content, and with
   the extent to which it is concealed by nonhost neighbours from its insect
   pests.^[109]

   In ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the
   habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of
   tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and
   creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus

   olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to
   make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica
   and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many
   rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for
   consumption.^[112] Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be
   described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These
   include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa),

   In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of sap at the end of the
   winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of
   the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a
   sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining
   10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is
   harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the
   liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse
   where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. Similarly in

   Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include cinnamon, made
   from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice,
   the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a
   seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and
   cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium
   aromaticum).^[116]

   Many trees have flowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees. The
   production of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the
   developing world where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using

   candied.^[118] Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark
   from the roots of the sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).

   The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some
   can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes
   them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those
   of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (in Thai food)^[119] and Ailanthus (in
   Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus
   nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used
   for flavouring food.^[116] Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a
   small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to
   make picking the leaves easier.^[120]

   [IMG]Roof trusses made from softwood

   Timber, "trees that are grown in order to produce wood"^[125] is cut into
   lumber (sawn wood) for use in construction. Wood has been an important,
   easily available material for construction since humans started building
--
   into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard,
   hardboard, chipboard and plywood.^[127] The wood of conifers is known as
   softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.^[128]

  Art

   Besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have been used to
   create art. Living trees have been used in bonsai and in tree shaping, and
   both living and dead specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic
   shapes.^[129]

    Bonsai

   [IMG]Informal upright style of bonsai on a juniper tree
   Main article: Bonsai

--
   there are similar practices in other cultures like the living miniature
   landscapes of Vietnam hòn non bộ. The word bonsai is often used in English
   as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.^[131]

   The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and
   the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).^[132]
   Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or
   more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting,
   seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development.
   Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or
   shrub species^[133] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to
   remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some

   [IMG]People trees, by Pooktre

   Tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees and other woody
   plants into man made shapes for art and useful structures. There are a few
   different methods^[135] of shaping a tree. There is a gradual method and
   there is an instant method. The gradual method slowly guides the growing
   tip along predetermined pathways over time whereas the instant method
--
   becomes more rigid as they thicken up.^[136] Most artists use grafting of
   living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or functional structures and
   there are plans to grow "living houses" with the branches of trees
   knitting together to give a solid, weatherproof exterior combined with an
   interior application of straw and clay to provide a stucco-like inner
--
   Tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the
   oldest known examples being the living root bridges built and maintained
   by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using the roots of the rubber tree
   (Ficus elastica).^[137]^[138]

   Cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It
   is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an
   environmentally sustainable industry.^[139] More than half the world's
   cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine
--

   The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe
   for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been
   used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after
   various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats
--

   At least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of
   trees.^[142] Quinine originates from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was
   for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.^[143]
   Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the
   bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects.^[144] The
   anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in
   the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia).^[145] Other tree based
   drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the
   cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and
   the downy birch (Betula pubescens).^[142]

   The papery bark of the white birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used
   extensively by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes
   were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and

  Ornamental trees

   Main article: Ornamental trees

   Trees create a visual impact in the same way as do other landscape
--
   fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a
   landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings
   of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living
   things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to
   year.^[148]

   Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as
   street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through
   evapotranspiration, absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept
   rainfall, and reduce the risk of flooding. Scientific studies show that
   street trees help cities be more sustainable, and improve the physical and
   mental wellbeing of the citizens.^[149] It has been shown that they are
   beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing
   stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.^[150] In
   London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street
   trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to
   one tree for every resident.^[151]

  Other uses

   [IMG]Latex collecting from a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)
   Further information: Resin, Latex, and Camphor

   Latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against
   herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the
   latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea
   brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the
   waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for
   which synthetic materials have proved less durable.^[152] The latex exuded
   by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is
   similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the "getah perca" tree
   Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea
   cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely

   Resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a
   viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile terpenes and is produced mostly
   by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings
   and in ten-pin bowling balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and
   the remaining product is called "rosin" and is used by stringed
--
   used in incense and aromatherapy. Fossilised resin is known as amber and
   was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more
   recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or
   spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.^[154]

   The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil^[116] and
   the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus
   oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.^[155]

Threats

  Individual trees

   Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe
   storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the
   presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and
   reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce
   building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water
   stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and
   insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating
   trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and
   death.^[156]

  Conservation

   About a third of all tree species, some twenty thousand, are included in
   the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Of those, over eight thousand are
   globally threatened, including at least 1400 which are classed as

   Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts,
   certain trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special
   significance^[158] as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental
   objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often
   linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as
   oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs who
   inhabited trees.

   The Oubangui people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As
   the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive,
   the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time
   for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the
   individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.^[159]

   Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended
   towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as
   a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens.
   In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and
   branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it.^[160] In
   India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that
   emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be
   worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the
   devout who tie threads round the trunk.^[161] Democracy started in North
   America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy,
   inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their
   weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus
   strobus).^[162] In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and
   the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of
   Eden.^[163]
--
   or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural
   penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the
   felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves may be
   the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater
   than the surrounding area.^[164] Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as
   Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or
   Kadambariyamman, associated with the cadamba tree, were seen as
   manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in
   abundance.^[165]

   How can you make a difference in reducing the urban heat island effect?

   Plant a tree in your own yard. Myriad resources for advice abound,
   including at TreesForHonolululu.org, local nurseries, and certified
   arborists to help you select the right tree in the right place and provide
   the right care.

   Volunteer! Numerous organizations actively plant and maintain trees. Where
   to start? The Events listing at TreesForHonolululu.org is a good place.

   Request a street tree. Call the City’s Division of Urban Forestry at (808)
   971-7151 or email DUF@honolulu.gov. Keep in mind that not all requests
   will be approved as the location must meet various standards, however,
   staff will review and consider your request. If approved, the city will
   plant and prune the tree, but you will need to commit to watering the
   trees to help get it established.

   There is zero enforcement of building codes that require trees and shrubs
   planted in new or expanded parking lots and landscaped street-facing
   planters. Typically the construction contractor installs per plans, then
   the owners/maintainers let 'em die, improperly prune by stunting and
   'lollypop' rounding over, or actually remove and not replace. I've seen a
   maintenance guy torture trees, at a gas station along Kam Hwy, by
   literally plucking off the leaves, from a ladder, repeatedly, until it
   died. No one ever comes back and makes 'em replant the trees. Better
   solution would be groups of trees or a large tree, allowed to grow large,
   on a corner or edge and not try to spot lollypop trees every so many
   stalls like you see. The key is actual shaded areas on the parking lot,
   not how many shadeless lolly pops you have.

   If you’re a TypeScript developer with some familiarity of the TypeScript
   architecture, you may have heard about the abstract syntax tree (AST).

   AST is an approach to transform the source code into an optimized abstract
   syntax tree, then execute the program following this tree structure, or
   use it to generate native code just-in-time.

   However, for interpreters, AST causes more overhead. Interpreters walking

B-Tree Indexing Explained

   B-tree indexing is the process of sorting large blocks of data to make
   searching through that data faster and easier. A B-tree stores data such
   that each node contains keys in ascending order. Each of these keys has
   two references to another two child nodes. The left side child node keys

What Is B-tree?

   A B-tree is a data structure that provides sorted data and allows
   searches, sequential access, attachments and removals in sorted order. The
   B-tree is highly capable of storing systems that write large blocks of
   data. The B-tree simplifies the binary search tree by allowing nodes with
   more than two children. Below is a B-tree example.

   Illustration of a b-treeIllustration of a B-tree index. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   B-tree stores data such that each node contains keys in ascending order.
   Each of these keys has two references to another two child nodes. The left
   side child node keys are less than the current keys, and the right side

   search to all elements. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   Look familiar? It’s a binary tree. This is the simplest form of the
   B-tree. For a binary tree, we can use pointers instead of keeping data in
   a sorted array. Mathematically, we can prove that the worst case search
   time for a binary tree is O(log(n)). 

   The concept of Binary tree can be extended into a more generalized form,
   which is known as B-tree. Instead of having a single entry for a single
   node, B-tree uses an array of entries for a single node and has references
   to a child node for each of these entries. Below are some time complexity
   comparisons of each pre-described method.
--
B+Tree vs. B-Tree: What’s the Difference?

   B+ tree is another data structure that’s used to store data and looks
   almost the same as the B-tree. The only difference is that B+ tree stores
   data on the leaf nodes. This means that all non-leaf node values are
   duplicated in leaf nodes again. Below is a sample B+tree.

   An illustration of a B+treeAn illustration of a B+tree. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

--

   Leaf nodes include all values and all of the records are in sorted order.
   B+tree allows you to do the same search as B-tree, but it also allows you
   to  travel through all the values in a leaf node if we put a pointer to
   each leaf node as follows.

How Is B-Tree Indexing Used in a Database?

   When B-tree comes to the database indexing, this data structure gets a
   little complicated because it doesn’t just have a key, it also has a value
   associated with the key. This value is a reference to the actual data
--
   each of the given records and converts the relevant rows into a byte
   stream. Then, it stores each of the keys and record byte streams on a
   B+tree. Here, the random index used as the key for indexing. The key and
   record byte stream is altogether known as Payload. The resulting B+tree
   could be represented as follows.

   A B+tree on database pagesA B+tree on database pages. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   Here you can see that all records are stored in the leaf nodes of the
   B+tree and index and are used as the key to create a B+tree. No records
   are stored on non-leaf nodes. Each of the leaf nodes references the next
   record in the tree. A database can perform a binary search by using the
   index or sequential search by searching through every element by only
   traveling through the leaf nodes.
--
   If no indexing is used, then the database reads each of these records to
   find the given record. When indexing is enabled, the database creates
   three B-trees for each of the columns in the table, as follows. Here the
   key is the B-tree key used to index. The index is the reference to the
   actual data record:

   B-tree used as an index to the actual recordB-tree used as an index to the
   actual record. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   When indexing is used first, the database searches a given key in
   correspondence to B-tree and gets the index in O(log(n)) time. Then, it
   performs another search in B+tree by using the already found index in
   O(log(n)) time and gets the record.

   Each of these nodes in B-tree and B+tree is stored inside the pages. Pages
   are fixed in size. Pages have a unique number starting from one. A page
   can be a reference to another page by using a page number. At the

   Databases should have an efficient way to store, read, and modify data.
   B-tree provides an efficient way to insert and read data. In actual
   database implementation, the database uses both B-tree and B+tree together
   to store data. B-tree used for indexing and B+tree used to store the
   actual records. B+tree provides sequential search capabilities in addition
   to the binary search, which gives the database more control to search
   non-index values in a database.

   A linden tree has large, spreading branches.Evergreen trees keep their
   needlelike leaves year-round.Trees are tall, woody plants. They usually
   have a stem called a trunk. Trees are some of the largest and oldest
   living things on Earth. Some trees live for hundreds or even thousands of
   years. There are more than 80,000 species, or types, of tree. Well-known
   trees include birches, firs, maples, palms, and pines.

   Plants called conifers have cones that contain the plant's seeds.Some
   trees have flowers in the spring.The Lawson cypress and the English elm
   look different because they are two different types of tree.…Scientists
   divide trees into groups based on how they reproduce. Some trees reproduce
   with spores, or particles that grow into new plants. They are called tree
   ferns. Most trees reproduce with seeds. Some seed-bearing trees grow their
   seeds in cones. They are called conifers. Most seed-bearing trees grow
   their seeds in fruits or pods. They are known as broad-leaved or flowering
   trees.

   Scientists also group trees based on whether they lose their leaves. Trees
   that keep their leaves year-round are called evergreens. Trees that lose
   their leaves during the autumn and winter are called deciduous trees.

   Coast redwood trees are the tallest trees.Trees are usually more than 10
   feet (3 meters) tall. They have roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves. The
   trunk and branches are made of fibers called wood. These fibers are
   protected by an outer covering called bark. As the tree ages, the trunk
   and branches thicken. In some cases the number of rings in the trunk shows
   the age of the tree.

   The leaves make food for the tree through a process called photosynthesis.
   Veins run through the leaves. They carry water and food to and from the
   branches. Leaves are usually green. The leaves of deciduous trees often
   change colors in autumn before they fall off. New leaves then grow in
   spring.

   to people and other animals. Many animals, including some birds, monkeys,
   apes, sloths, frogs, and squirrels live in trees. They also get their food
   from trees, including leaves, nuts, and fruits. For example, koalas spend
   most of their time in eucalyptus trees and eat only eucalyptus leaves.
   People use tree wood to build homes and furniture. Paper is made from wood
   fibers. Many people burn wood to cook and to heat their homes. Farmers
   plant orchards of trees that grow fruit for humans to eat.

   Many people enjoy hiking and playing in parks and forests.Many cities
   plant trees in parks and along streets to make those areas pleasant to
   look at and to spend time in. Forests and parks are places that protect

   [IMG]A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
   [IMG]It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
   men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
   emanates from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
   spirit. ~ Robert Louis Stevenson [IMG]The earth brought forth vegetation,
   plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit
   in which is their seed, according to its kind. And God saw that it was
   good. ~ Genesis 1:12.

   Trees are plants with elongated stems, or trunks, supporting leaves or
   branches. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always
   been revered and they play a role in much of the world's mythology,
   metaphor and symbolism.

   [IMG]A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
   leaves; the tree species, in fact,it needs and evolves to fight the moose,

       leaves; the tree species, in fact, evolves to fight the moose, to keep
       the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
       twigs. In the final analysis, the merciless hand of natural selection
       will favor the birch genes that make the tree less and less palatable
       to the moose in generation after generation. No plant species could
       survive for long by offering itself as unprotected fodder.

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
--
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
--
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

--
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
--
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

   JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
--
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Other terms used with trees:

   Ordered tree
           A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children
           of each vertex. The book The Art of Computer Programming uses the
           term oriented tree.^[4]

   Size of a tree
           Number of nodes in the tree.

Examples of trees and non-trees[edit]

   [IMG]
   Not a tree: two non-connected parts, A→B and C→D→E. There is more than one
   root.
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: undirected cycle 1-2-4-3. 4 has more than one parent (inbound
   edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle B→C→E→D→B. B has more than one parent (inbound edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle A→A. A is the root but it also has a parent.

   Each linear list is trivially a tree.

Common operations[edit]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
--
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of
--
   tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

   Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example
   with natural numbers.^[5]

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

--
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the
   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
--
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

     A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to
     represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and
     search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has
     a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

     The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it
     are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and
     these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a
--
   the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node,
   structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can
   also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves
   connected with one another.

--
       called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child
       nodes of {B}.
     * Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have
       any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the
       tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly
       one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
     * Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child
       nodes are called leaf nodes. {K, L, M, N, O, P, G} are the leaf nodes
       of the tree.
     * Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to
       that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor
--
     * Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called
       neighbors of that node.
     * Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.

Representation of Tree Data Structure:

     A tree consists of a root, and zero or more subtrees T_1, T_2, … , T_k
     such that there is an edge from the root of the tree to the root of each
     subtree.

   Types of Trees in Data Structure based on the number of children

     * Binary tree: In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two
       children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full
       binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and
       degenerate or pathological binary trees.
     * Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each
       node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”,
       “mid” and “right”.
     * N-ary Tree or Generic Tree: Generic trees are a collection of nodes
       where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a
       list of references to its children(duplicate references are not
--
       multiple nodes.

Basic Operation Of Tree Data Structure:

     * Create – create a tree in the data structure.
     * Insert − Inserts data in a tree.
     * Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is
       present or not.
     * Traversal:
          * Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order
            manner in the data structure.
          * In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order
            manner.
          * Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order
            manner.

Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?

   The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e., they are
   not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or we
   can say it is a hierarchical structure. For this reason, the tree is
   considered to be a non-linear data structure.

     * Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two
       nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is
       only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.
     * Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the
       path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to
       the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the
       path from the root of the tree to the node.
     * Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of
       the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest
       path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is
       called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0.
       The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the
       nodes in the tree.

Need for Tree Data Structure

   1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information
   that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a
   computer: 
--
       files.
     * Data Compression: Huffman coding is a popular technique for data
       compression that involves constructing a binary tree where the leaves
       represent characters and their frequency of occurrence. The resulting
       tree is used to encode the data in a way that minimizes the amount of
       storage required.

Advantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Tree offer Efficient Searching Depending on the type of tree, with
       average search times of O(log n) for balanced trees like AVL. 
     * Trees provide a hierarchical representation of data, making it easy to
       organize and navigate large amounts of information.
     * The recursive nature of trees makes them easy to traverse and
       manipulate using recursive algorithms.

--
Disadvantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Unbalanced Trees, meaning that the height of the tree is skewed
       towards one side, which can lead to inefficient search times.
     * Trees demand more memory space requirements than some other data
       structures like arrays and linked lists, especially if the tree is
       very large.
     * The implementation and manipulation of trees can be complex and
       require a good understanding of the algorithms.

                             Kruskal's tree theorem

   [ ] 7 languages
--
   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   In mathematics, Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees
   over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under
   homeomorphic embedding.
--
   with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion).

   In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the
   Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in
   reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function
--

   The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's
   formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

   Given a tree T with a root, and given vertices v, w, call w a successor of
   v if the unique path from the root to w contains v, and call w an
   immediate successor of v if additionally the path from v to w contains no
   other vertex.

   Take X to be a partially ordered set. If T_1, T_2 are rooted trees with
   vertices labeled in X, we say that T_1 is inf-embeddable in T_2 and write
   T_1 ≤ T_2 if there is an injective map F from the vertices of T_1 to the
--
       path from F(w_1) to F(w_2) in T_2 contains F(v).

   Kruskal's tree theorem then states:

     If X is well-quasi-ordered, then the set of rooted trees with labels in
     X is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above.
     (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T_1, T_2, … of rooted trees
     labeled in X, there is some i &amp;lt; j so that T_i ≤ T_j.)

Friedman's work[edit]

   For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and
   proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or
   the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the

   weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first
   observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the
   then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees
   above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has size
   one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR_0,^[1] thus
--
   impredicative proof.^[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0, but by adding a "gap condition"^[3] to the definition of the
   order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem
   unprovable in this system.^[4]^[5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour
   theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π^1
--
   (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).^[citation needed]

Weak tree function[edit]

   Suppose that P(n) is the statement:

           There is some m such that if T_1, ..., T_m is a finite sequence of
           unlabeled rooted trees where T_i has i + n vertices, then
           T_i ≤ T_j for some i &amp;lt; j.

--
   grows extremely quickly with n.

   Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have
   the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of unlabeled rooted trees, where
           each T_i has at most i + n vertices, such that T_i ≤ T_j does not
           hold for any i &amp;lt; j ≤ m.

   It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960,
   tree(4) &amp;gt; Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument
   specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than {\displaystyle
   \mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree}
   ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{8}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7).}

   To differentiate the two functions, "TREE" with all letters capitalized is
   the big TREE function and "tree" with all letters in lowercase is the weak
   tree function.

TREE function[edit]

   Sequence of trees where each node is colored either green, red, blueA
   sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue &amp;lt; red &amp;lt;
   green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no
   tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is
   defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of rooted trees labelled from a

           T_i ≤ T_j does not hold for any i &amp;lt; j ≤ m.

   this structure, the root is at the top, and its branches are moving in a

   Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.               
                                                                              
     * A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or         
       entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or       
       simulate hierarchy.                                                    
     * A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does   
       not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as    
       elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.                    
     * In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node.  
       Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the      
       above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so   
       the type of data would be a string.

   Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.                              
                                                                              
   Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:                   
                                                                              
   Tree

   shown in the above figure is known as a link between the two nodes.        
                                                                              
     * Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In      
       other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In 
       the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If  
       a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a     
       parent-child relationship.

     * Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.    
     * Leaf Node:- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node,   
       is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the      
       tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. 
       Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.                          
     * Internal nodes: A node has atleast one child node known as an internal 
     * Ancestor node:- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a     
       path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any        
       ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are 
       the ancestors of node 10.

     * Recursive data structure: The tree is also known as a recursive data   
       structure. A tree can be defined as recursively because the            
       distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a root node.   
       The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its      
       subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below   
       figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left      
       subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different    
       colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner.   
       So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented  
       in various applications.

   Based on the properties of the Tree data structure, trees are classified   
   into various categories.

   The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically   
   with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented   
   as shown below:                                                            
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in    
   the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The    
   second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the

   The above structure can only be defined for the binary trees because the   
   binary tree can have utmost two children, and generic trees can have more  
   than two children. The structure of the node for generic trees would be    
   different as compared to the binary tree.                                  
                                                                              
     Applications of trees                                                    
                                                                              
   The following are the applications of trees:                               
                                                                              
     * Storing naturally hierarchical data: Trees are used to store the data  
       in the hierarchical structure. For example, the file system. The file  
       system stored on the disc drive, the file and folder are in the form   
       of the naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees.    
     * Organize data: It is used to organize data for efficient insertion,    
       deletion and searching. For example, a binary tree has a logN time for 
       searching an element.                                                  
     * Trie: It is a special kind of tree that is used to store the           
       dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking. 
     * Heap: It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is 
       used to implement priority queues.                                     
     * B-Tree and B+Tree: B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used 
       to implement indexing in databases.                                    
     * Routing table: The tree data structure is also used to store the data  
       in routing tables in the routers.                                      
                                                                              
     Types of Tree data structure                                             
                                                                              
   The following are the types of a tree data structure:                      
                                                                              
     * General tree: The general tree is one of the types of tree data        
       structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n  
       number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the  
       node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node   
       in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent  
       node are known as subtrees.                                            
       Tree                                                                   
       There can be n number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general    
       tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be 
       ordered.                                                               
       Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are          
       connected to the nodes known as child nodes. The root node is labeled  
       with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as         
       siblings.                                                              
     * Binary tree: Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0    
       and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child 
       nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2    
       nodes.                                                                 
       Tree

     * Binary Search tree: Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure  
       in which one node is connected to n number of nodes. It is a           
       node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary       
       search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and        
       right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in  
       a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child    
       and right child pointer).                                              
       Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the      
       value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right        
       subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.                
                                                                              
   A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as   
--
   right pointer of the node type.

     * AVL tree                                                               
                                                                              
   It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a      
   variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the  
   binary tree as well as of the binary search tree. It is a self-balancing   
   binary search tree that was invented by Adelson Velsky Lindas. Here,       
   self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right  
   subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the balancing factor.      
                                                                              
   We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search  
   tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as 
   the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of    
   the right subtree. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or   
   1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the       
   balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.

   https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree                                        
                                                                              
     * Red-Black Tree                                                         
                                                                              
   The red-Black tree is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the      
   Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a   
   binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the  
   value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater   
   than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary 
   search in the average case is log_2n, the best case is O(1), and the worst 
   case is O(n).                                                              
                                                                              
   When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be        
   balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion,   
   etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time          
   complexity of log_2n.                                                      
                                                                              
   The red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is     
   also a height balancing binary search tree then why do we require a        
   Red-Black tree. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would   
   be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 
   rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that 
   represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing 
   of the tree.                                                               
                                                                              
     * Splay tree                                                             
                                                                              
   The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently 
   accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some 
   rotation operations. Here, splaying means the recently accessed node. It   
   is a self-balancing binary search tree having no explicit balance          
   condition like AVL tree.                                                   
                                                                              
   It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced,   
   i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the           
   operations in splay tree takes order of logN time where n is the number of 
   nodes.                                                                     
                                                                              
   Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height      
   balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which    
   leads to a balanced tree.                                                  
                                                                              
     * Treap

   Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it    
   comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary  
   search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the  
   value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or 
   greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both      
   right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we   
   can say that the root node contains the lowest value.                      
                                                                              
   In treap data structure, each node has both key and priority where key is  
   derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap  
   data structure.

     * Right child of a node&amp;gt;=current node and left child of a node &amp;lt;=current 
       node (binary tree)                                                     
     * Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap)           
     * B-tree                                                                 
                                                                              
   B-tree is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree.     
   Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have  
   more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the       
   sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at      
   different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same    
   level.                                                                     
                                                                              
   If order is m then node has the following properties:                      
                                                                              
     * Each node in a b-tree can have maximum m children                      
     * For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has        
       minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2

   In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices
   are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
   undirected graph.^[1] A forest is an undirected graph in which any two
   vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic
   undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.^[2]

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented
   forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a
   forest.

   The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer
   science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although
   such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be
   directed, called a directed rooted tree,^[8]^[9] either making all its
   edges point away from the root—in which case it is called an
   arborescence^[4]^[10] or out-tree^[11]^[12]—or making all its edges point
   towards the root—in which case it is called an anti-arborescence^[13] or
   in-tree.^[11]^[14] A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors
   as a directed graph.^[15]^[16]^[17] A rooted forest is a disjoint union of
   rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted
   forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each
   rooted tree—in which case it is called a branching or out-forest—or making
   all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree—in which case it
   is called an anti-branching or in-forest.

   The term tree was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur
   Cayley.^[18]

  Tree[edit]

   A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following
   equivalent conditions:

--

   As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no
   vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously
   connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is
   not 0-connected (or even (−1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike
   non-empty trees, and violates the "one more vertex than edges" relation.
   It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.

   An internal vertex (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2.
   Similarly, an external vertex (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf)
   is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree
   at least 3.^[19]

   An irreducible tree (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is
   no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence A000014 in the OEIS).^[20]

--
   A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
   at most one path. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected acyclic graph,
   all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph
   consists of a disjoint union of trees. As special cases, the order-zero
   graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless
   graph, are examples of forests. Since for every tree V − E = 1, we can
   easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting
   the difference between total vertices and total edges. TV − TE = number of
   trees in a forest.

  Polytree[edit]

   Main article: Polytree

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed
   edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both
   connected and acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed tree" to the case where
   the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed
   away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).
--
   branching).

  Rooted tree[edit]

   A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the
   root.^[21] The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural
   orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the
   structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has
   an orientation away from the root, it is called an arborescence^[4] or
   out-tree;^[11] when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called
   an anti-arborescence or in-tree.^[11] The tree-order is the partial
   ordering on the vertices of a tree with u &amp;lt; v if and only if the unique
   path from the root to v passes through u. A rooted tree T that is a
   subgraph of some graph G is a normal tree if the ends of every T-path in G
   are comparable in this tree-order (Diestel 2005, p. 15). Rooted trees,
   often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at
   each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data
   structure.

   In a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any
   designated root is called a free tree.

   A labeled tree is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The
   vertices of a labeled tree on n vertices (for nonnegative integers n) are
   typically given the labels 1, 2, …, n. A recursive tree is a labeled
   rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if u &amp;lt; v
   for two vertices u and v, then the label of u is smaller than the label of
   v).

   In a rooted tree, the parent of a vertex v is the vertex connected to v on
   the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root
   has no parent.^[21] A child of a vertex v is a vertex of which v is the
--
   descendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either a child of v or is
   (recursively) a descendant of a child of v. A sibling to a vertex v is any
   other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with v.^[21] A leaf is a
   vertex with no children.^[21] An internal vertex is a vertex that is not a
   leaf.^[21]

   The height of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest
   downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The height of the tree is the
   height of the root. The depth of a vertex is the length of the path to its
   root (root path). This^[clarification needed (This ___?)] is commonly
   needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees
   in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a
   tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has
   depth^[clarification needed (we've only defined depth of a vertex, not
   also the depth of the tree)] and height zero. Conventionally, an empty
   tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height
   −1.

   A k-ary tree (for nonnegative integers k) is a rooted tree in which each
   vertex has at most k children.^[22] 2-ary trees are often called binary
   trees, while 3-ary trees are sometimes called ternary trees.

  Ordered tree[edit]

   An ordered tree (alternatively, plane tree or positional tree^[23]) is a
   rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each
   vertex.^[21]^[24] This is called a "plane tree" because an ordering of the
   children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the
   root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex.
   Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction
   of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the
   children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing
   the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be
   drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.

Properties[edit]

     * Every tree is a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if
       it contains no cycles of odd length. Since a tree contains no cycles
       at all, it is bipartite.
     * Every tree with only countably many vertices is a planar graph.
     * Every connected graph G admits a spanning tree, which is a tree that
       contains every vertex of G and whose edges are edges of G. More
       specific types spanning trees, existing in every connected finite
       graph, include depth-first search trees and breadth-first search
       trees. Generalizing the existence of depth-first-search trees, every
       connected graph with only countably many vertices has a Trémaux
       tree.^[25] However, some uncountable-order graphs do not have such a
       tree.^[26]
     * Every finite tree with n vertices, with n &amp;gt; 1, has at least two
       terminal vertices (leaves). This minimal number of leaves is
       characteristic of path graphs; the maximal number, n − 1, is attained
       only by star graphs. The number of leaves is at least the maximum
       vertex degree.
     * For any three vertices in a tree, the three paths between them have
       exactly one vertex in common. More generally, a vertex in a graph that
       belongs to three shortest paths among three vertices is called a
       median of these vertices. Because every three vertices in a tree have
       a unique median, every tree is a median graph.
     * Every tree has a center consisting of one vertex or two adjacent
       vertices. The center is the middle vertex or middle two vertices in
       every longest path. Similarly, every n-vertex tree has a centroid
       consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. In the first case
       removal of the vertex splits the tree into subtrees of fewer than n/2
       vertices. In the second case, removal of the edge between the two
       centroidal vertices splits the tree into two subtrees of exactly n/2
       vertices.
     * The maximal cliques of a tree are precisely its edges, implying that
       the class of trees has few cliques.

Enumeration[edit]

  Labeled trees[edit]

   Cayley's formula states that there are n^n−2 trees on n labeled vertices.
   A classic proof uses Prüfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger
   result: the number of trees with vertices 1, 2, …, n of degrees d_1, d_2,
   …, d_n respectively, is the multinomial coefficient

           {\displaystyle {n-2 \choose d_{1}-1,d_{2}-1,\ldots ,d_{n}-1}.}

   A more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph,
   which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem. (Cayley's formula is the
   special case of spanning trees in a complete graph.) The similar problem
   of counting all the subtrees regardless of size is #P-complete in the
   general case (Jerrum (1994)).

  Unlabeled trees[edit]

   Counting the number of unlabeled free trees is a harder problem. No closed
   formula for the number t(n) of trees with n vertices up to graph
   isomorphism is known. The first few values of t(n) are

--

   This is a consequence of his asymptotic estimate for the number r(n) of
   unlabeled rooted trees with n vertices:

           r(n) \sim D\alpha^n n^{-3/2} \quad\text{as } n\to\infty,
--
           (sequence A000081 in the OEIS).

Types of trees[edit]

     * A path graph (or linear graph) consists of n vertices arranged in a
       line, so that vertices i and i + 1 are connected by an edge for i = 1,
       …, n – 1.
     * A starlike tree consists of a central vertex called root and several
       path graphs attached to it. More formally, a tree is starlike if it
       has exactly one vertex of degree greater than 2.
     * A star tree is a tree which consists of a single internal vertex (and
       n – 1 leaves). In other words, a star tree of order n is a tree of
       order n with as many leaves as possible.
     * A caterpillar tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance
       1 of a central path subgraph.
     * A lobster tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 2
       of a central path subgraph.
     * A regular tree of degree d is the infinite tree with d edges at each
       vertex. These arise as the Cayley graphs of free groups, and in the
       theory of Tits buildings.

--
   [Episcopal News Service] The Christian holy day Epiphany, on Jan. 6, is
   also known as the “Feast of Lights,” and some Episcopal congregations
   celebrate this feast quite literally, by burning Christmas trees and
   greens in recognition of Jesus as a light to the world.

   “If you’ve ever seen Christmas trees burn … they go up in a tremendous
   blaze,” the Rev. Hillary Raining told Episcopal News Service in describing
   the annual Epiphany bonfire at St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in

   A similar blaze is planned at All Saints’ Episcopal Church in
   Russellville, Arkansas. The fire, a mix of Christmas trees and ordinary
   firewood, will be followed by a short liturgy and blessing of kits of
   chalk that attendees can use to mark their front doors with the initials

   And at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, the
   congregation will continue a local Epiphany tradition dating back more
   than 50 years when it hosts a Christmas tree bonfire on a nearby beach.

   congregation in the years since Hurricane Katrina destroyed the former

   At All Saints’, the church in Arkansas, the bonfire is scheduled for the

   worshipers gather outdoors around the burning trees. The church is located

   safety, Clements said, while still “bringing some light into the darkness,

   Raining, the rector at St. Christopher’s in suburban Philadelphia, noted
   that Christmas tree burns have ancient roots in Twelfth Night
   celebrations, which marked the end of the Christmas season. And though
   burning trees may not seem like the most environmentally friendly
   practice, Raining said it is preferable to leaving trees on the curb for
   disposal in a landfill. Also, the ashes from the fire will be used to
   fertilize the grounds of the church.

   St. Christopher’s will host its Christmas tree bonfire in the evening Jan.
   7, with the public invited to bring trees and greens from home. Past
   bonfires have been community events, attracting some residents who don’t
   normally attend the church. The church also invites the local fire

   What is a tree? How are trees different from grasses, sunflowers,
   dandelions, and other types of plants? And what do trees have in common
   with shrubs and woody vines? The answers to these questions seem obvious
   at first. But unless you are a botanist you may find that the answers
   don't come easily. Let's look a little closer to find some common
   characteristics of trees, shrubs, and woody vines.

   Trees, shrubs, and vines belong to many different plant families. Some are
   closely related, like ponderosa pine and limber pine. Others are not
   closely related at all, like eastern red cedar and silver maple. However,
   trees, shrubs, and vines all have one thing that separates them from the
   rest of the plant world: a woody stem that is perennial or that lives for
   many years. Grasses and certain other plants may be perennial, but their
--
   Let's look at each of the parts of a woody plant's stem and see how they
   are put together and how they grow larger year after year. If you could
   tunnel into a woody plant's stem, whether the trunk of a tree or a twig on
   a shrub, you would first encounter bark, then cambium, and finally wood or
   xylem. Bark is the outer covering on the trunk, twigs, and woody roots.
--
   New bark is constantly being made on the inside and pushed out. This is
   why older trunks usually have rough outer bark that peels or flakes away.
   Bark is highly variable, though. Young trees of most species have fairly
   smooth bark. To see what a tree's bark looked like when it was young, look
   at the young bark on upper branches and twigs.

   (A) outer bark (dry dead tissue)

   called the cambium. This layer repeatedly divides, first in then out, to
   form all of the new wood and bark. Wood, or xylem, makes up everything
   inside the cambium on tree trunks, branches, twigs, and woody roots. Wood
   is made up of fibers for strength and hollow tubes of different sizes.
   These tubes are like straws that conduct water from the roots to the

   is responsible for all water and mineral movement through the stem.

   Ponderosa PineMost people would agree that this ponderosa pine is a tree,
   but...

   Canyon Maple tree...the canyon maple and Utah junipers in this picture
   might be considered shrubs. Given enough time to grow, all of them should
   meet the definition of a tree.

   So trees, shrubs, and woody vines all have woody, perennial stems. What
   makes them different from one another? The distinction between trees and
   shrubs is not always clear. We all know that a large cottonwood is a tree
   and a creeping juniper is a shrub, but there are many shrub-like trees and
   tree-like shrubs. Though no scientific definition exists to separate trees
   and shrubs, a useful definition for a tree is a woody plant having one
   erect perennial stem (trunk) at least three inches in diameter at a point
   4-1/2 feet above the ground, a definitely formed crown of foliage, and a
   mature height of at least 13 feet. This definition works fine, though some
   trees may have more than one stem and young trees obviously don't meet the
   size criteria. A shrub can then be defined as a woody plant with several
   perennial stems that may be erect or may lay close to the ground. It will

   the trees. This work will also be weather dependent, so if it does end up
   raining or snowing that day we're going to need to bump that work down the
   road a bit."

      What's the oldest tree on Earth—and will it survive climate change?

   U.S. quarters. For decades, bristlecone pines, which can survive for up to
   5,000 years, were thought to be the planet’s oldest living things. Now a
   tree in Chile is posing a challenge.

   little else does. At altitudes near 11,000 feet along Nevada’s rocky Snake
    Range there are no grasses, no brush, few pests, no competition. No
   people to start wildfires. No nearby trees to spread pathogens.

   With nothing around to kill them, these ancient beasts are left alone year

   spread through their groves. But as fires grow bigger and more intense
   with climate change, the infernos pose a greater threat to these
   long-lived trees. 
   Right: Bristlecones grow slowly, which makes their sculpted wood difficult
   for pathogens and insects to penetrate, helping them live long lives.

   scientists. 
   Another strategy that keeps bristlecone pines going is “strip barking.”
   Even when sections of the tree die, the rest may live on as narrow bands
   of living tissue and bark connect roots to high branches. In some cases 95
   percent of the tree may be dead, while this small portion lives on.

   pyramids were erected at Giza. That includes Methuselah, in California’s
   White Mountains, the oldest documented living bristlecone, which, based on
   tree-ring data, is 4,853 years old.

   Scientists have long believed that makes this tree the planet’s oldest
   single living thing. But that argument grew more complicated this month
   after a Chilean researcher used unusual techniques to date a tree of a
   different species, a Patagonian cypress. If correct, his work would make
   that South American conifer the newest oldest thing.

   The claim has tree researchers abuzz but skeptical, at least in part
   because the cypress, growing in a temperate rainforest, appears to live
   such a different life than a bristlecone. Despite their longevity both the
--
   Patagonian cypresses, also known as alerces, are native to Chile and
   Argentina and have long been recognized as the world’s second
   longest-lived tree species. The previous record-setting alerce was
   identified in the early 1990s by counting tree rings on a cut stump; it
   was more than 3,600 years old. (The oldest known giant sequoia, the third
   longest-lived species, was identified the same way and lived to 3,266.)
--
   But earlier this month, a story in Science by Gabriel Popkin revealed that
   environmental scientist Jonathan Barichivich and the researcher who first
   identified that old alerce had been studying another tree in a Chilean
   national park. The researchers used a T-shaped increment borer to drill in
   and remove a core sample from the moss-draped cypress. The boring device
   couldn’t reach the center of the tree, which is more than a dozen feet in
   diameter. But by combining their core sample with tree-ring information
   from other alerces, and using computer modeling, the pair estimated the
   tree was roughly 5,400 years old, with an 80 percent chance it was more
   than 5,000 years old.

   By combining a partial core sample with computer modeling, researchers in
   South America believe they can show that this Patagonian cypress tree,
   also called an alerce, towering out of a ravine in Chile, is at least
   5,000 years old, which would make it Earth’s oldest living tree. Some
   experts are skeptical.

--
   Others, though, are quite skeptical. Peter Brown, founder of Rocky
   Mountain Tree Ring Research, which gathers information on the world’s
   oldest trees, says Barichivich’s approach is too novel to make such a bold
   claim before publication. “There are many assumptions necessary for
   extrapolating total age from that,” Brown says.

   Brown doesn’t doubt the tree is significant. The partial core alone seems
   to show the tree was at least 2,400 years old, which would put it among
   the top 10 oldest trees on Brown’s list. But Brown has other reasons to be
   suspicious. For example, “this new estimated age is over 1,500 years older
   than the oldest known (alerce) tree to date,” Brown says.

   Brown also sees significant differences between the types of environments
   that tend to support the very oldest trees and the surroundings of the
   Patagonian cypress. In an isolated, austere landscape, like the snowy,
   rocky homes of slow-growing bristlecone, trees can just keep on going.
   Mossy rainforests, on the other hand, are full of life—and threats.

   Scientists still argue about why some trees are able to live so long. “My
   contention is that trees don’t necessarily die from old age like mammals,”
   Brown says. “Something has to come along and kill them.”

   Barichivich understands the skepticism. He says his colleague has found
   another alerce stump whose tree rings can all be counted and show it to be
   about 4,100 years old. (That data is also not yet published.) He also
   argues that tree-ring data suggests alerce actually grow more slowly than
   bristlecones, meaning their wood is also very dense.

   And as part of a recent research team that analyzed the relationship
   between the world’s longest-lived trees and climate, Barichivich believes
   the two species’ worlds are similar in the most important ways. The
   Chilean Coast Range is nothing like the American West, he says, “but there
--
   protected from fire and until recently from humans. Barichivich says his
   own Chilean grandfather, who worked as a ranger in the park, discovered
   the tree in the early 1970s and may well have been the first person to
   touch it.

--

   Regardless of which species turns out to be the longevity champ, those who
   study the world’s oldest trees are united by a common concern for how
   their favorite species will make it through rough times ahead.

--

   While the location of the very oldest bristlecones are kept secret,
   Barichivich’s Chilean tree now draws lots of tourists, who stomp around
   its base, potentially damaging roots. Climate change is also drying out
   the region, which could threaten the tree’s water uptake.

   Bristlecones, too, are seeing a changing world. On a cloudless day last
--
   One reason for that is the bristlecone’s capacity to handle stress. As
   soil erosion or root decay and age weaken a bristlecone’s trunk or
   branches, the entire tree does not die—only the portion under direct
   stress. Instead, these majestic beings practice “strip barking,” allowing
   thin bands of living tissue beneath the bark to curl up the tree
   delivering water from healthy roots. On some bristlecones, as little as 5
   percent of what you see may still, in fact, be alive.

   “You won’t usually see a super old tree that has bark all the way around
   it,” Baker says. “It’s just got this one little living part. Whole
   portions of the tree are now just really artistic-looking dead wood.”

   Bristlecones live across a broad altitude range, from about 6,500 feet up
   to more than 11,000 feet. They have survived all kinds of conditions. The
   trees are typically spaced far enough apart that even the occasional
   lightning-sparked fire rarely spreads beyond a few acres.

--

   Warming temperatures, drought, and more explosive fire pose new threats to
   these ancient trees, but mostly at the lower end of their range.
   Bristlecones are also susceptible to blister rust, an imported fungus that
   has killed millions of related trees, including whitebark pines in
   Yellowstone National Park. So far it has not appeared in the wild in Great
   Basin bristlecones.

   Everything you need to know about tree data structures

   When you first learn to code, it’s common to learn arrays as the “main
--
   logical start and a logical end.

   When we start learning about trees and graphs, it can get really
   confusing. We don’t store data in a linear way. Both data structures store
   data in a specific way.
--
   In this article, we will learn:

     * What is a tree
     * Examples of trees
     * Its terminology and how it works
     * How to implement tree structures in code.

   Let’s start this learning journey. :)
--

   When starting out programming, it is common to understand better the
   linear data structures than data structures like trees and graphs.

   Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They don’t store data
--
   What do I mean when I say in a hierarchical way?

   Imagine a family tree with relationships from all generation:
   grandparents, parents, children, siblings, etc. We commonly organize
   family trees hierarchically.

   In HTML, the Document Object Model (DOM) works as a tree.

   1*dLXUdR4NuIZG8GJdu_CinwDocument Object Model (DOM)

  A technical definition

   A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by
   edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a
   child node .
--
   1*3WN7tIQ-kNBQmY9MgvTuOA

   The first node of the tree is called the root. If this root node is
   connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the
   connected node is a child.
--

   All Tree nodes are connected by links called edges. It’s an important part
   of trees, because it’s manages the relationship between nodes.

   1*j5qKwIxKcEjoxy88EOc1Rg

   Leaves are the last nodes on a tree. They are nodes without children. Like
   real trees, we have the root, branches, and finally the leaves.

   1*c9_5uMUsIy4Q3OA7Q8bJiw
--
   Other important concepts to understand are height and depth.

   The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf.

   The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root.
--
  Terminology summary

     * Root is the topmost node of the tree
     * Edge is the link between two nodes
     * Child is a node that has a parent node
     * Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
     * Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
     * Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
     * Depth is the length of the path to its root

  Binary trees

   Now we will discuss a specific type of tree. We call it thebinary tree.

     “In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which
     each node has at the most two children, which are referred to as the
     left child and the right child.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s look at an example of a binary tree.

   1*ofbwuz4inpf2OlB-l9gtHw

  Let’s code a binary tree

   The first thing we need to keep in mind when we implement a binary tree is
   that it is a collection of nodes. Each node has three attributes: value,
   left_child, and right_child.

   How do we implement a simple binary tree that initializes with these three
   properties?

--
         self.right_child = None

   Here it is. Our binary tree class.

   When we instantiate an object, we pass the value (the data of the node) as
--
   Let’s test it:

 tree = BinaryTree('a')
 print(tree.value) # a
 print(tree.left_child) # None
 print(tree.right_child) # None

   That’s it.
--
   But not entirely. We still need to test it.

   Let’s build the followingtree:

   1*V_EUgNXVc8Wy9H1-JoqT3g

   To summarize the illustration of this tree:

     * a node will be the root of our binary Tree
--
     * both e and f nodes do not have children

   So here is the code for the tree:

 a_node = BinaryTree('a')
--
   Insertion is done.

   Now we have to think about tree traversal.

   We have two options here: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First
   Search (BFS).

     * DFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each
       branch before backtracking.” — Wikipedia
     * BFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes first,
       before moving to the next level neighbors.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s dive into each tree traversal type.

    Depth-First Search (DFS)

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result of the post order algorithm for this tree example is
   3–4–2–6–7–5–1.

--
    Breadth-First Search (BFS)

   BFS algorithm traverses the tree level by level and depth by depth.

   1*ZNxp_NkRZLCeak85rreebA
--
       queuehelper.

  Binary Search tree

     “A Binary Search Tree is sometimes called ordered or sorted binary
     trees, and it keeps its values in sorted order, so that lookup and other
     operations can use the principle of binary search” — Wikipedia

--
   Here is a breakdown of the above illustration:

     * A is inverted. The subtree 7–5–8–6 needs to be on the right side, and
       the subtree 2–1–3 needs to be on the left.
     * B is the only correct option. It satisfies the Binary Search Tree
       property.
--

   What will we see here? We will insert new nodes, search for a value,
   delete nodes, and the balance of the tree.

   Let’s start.

    Insertion: adding new nodes to our tree

   Imagine that we have an empty tree and we want to add new nodes with the
   following values in this order: 50, 76, 21, 4, 32, 100, 64, 52.

   The first thing we need to know is if 50 is the root of our tree.

   1*fxSlTwgQSN_DlzfEmcxqQg
--
    1. Is the new node value greater or smaller than the current node?
    2. If the value of the new node is greater than the current node, go to
       the right subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a right child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    3. If the value of the new node is smaller than the current node, go to
       the left subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a left child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    4. We did not handle special cases here. When the value of a new node is
       equal to the current value of the node, use rule number 3. Consider
       inserting equal values to the left side of the subtree.

   Now let’s code it.
--
   not have that value.

   An important item to note is how we defined the tree insertion algorithm.
   First we have our root node. All the left subtree nodes will have smaller
   values than the root node. And all the right subtree nodes will have
   values greater than the root node.

   Let’s take a look at an example.

   Imagine that we have this tree.

   1*LlLDNx7wgJfH6VAGnyAbIQ
--
    1. We start with the root node as our current node. Is the given value
       smaller than the current node value? If yes, then we will search for
       it on the left subtree.
    2. Is the given value greater than the current node value? If yes, then
       we will search for it on the right subtree.
    3. If rules #1 and #2 are both false, we can compare the current node
       value and the given value if they are equal. If the comparison returns
       true, then we can say, “Yeah! Our tree has the given value,”
       otherwise, we say, “Nooo, it hasn’t.”

--

   If the node we want to delete has no children, we simply delete it. The
   algorithm doesn’t need to reorganize the tree.

     * Scenario #2: A node with just one child (left or right child).
--
    3. From line 2 to line 9: We start searching for the node that has the
       valuethat we are looking for. If the value is smaller than the current
       nodevalue , we go to the left subtree, recursively (if, and only if,
       the current node has a left child). If the value is greater, go to the
       right subtree, recursively.
    4. Line 10: We start to think about the remove algorithm.
    5. From line 11 to line 13: We cover the node with no children , and it
--
   Now let’s test it.

   We will use this tree to test our remove_node algorithm.

 #        |15|
--

   Finally, we will remove a node with two children. This is the root of our
   tree.

   What a phylogenetic tree is. How to read phylogenetic trees and determine
   which species are most related.

Key points:

     * A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that represents evolutionary
       relationships among organisms. Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, not
       definitive facts.
     * The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species
       or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors.
     * In trees, two species are more related if they have a more recent
       common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common
       ancestor.
     * Phylogenetic trees can be drawn in various equivalent styles. Rotating
       a tree about its branch points doesn't change the information it
       carries.

--
   in ways that reflect our understanding of how they evolved from their
   common ancestors.
   In this article, we'll take a look at phylogenetic trees, diagrams that
   represent evolutionary relationships among organisms. We'll see exactly
   what we can (and can't!) infer from a phylogenetic tree, as well as what
   it means for organisms to be more or less related in the context of these
   trees.

Anatomy of a phylogenetic tree

   When we draw a phylogenetic tree, we are representing our best hypothesis
   about how a set of species (or other groups) evolved from a common
   ancestor1‍ . As we'll explore further in the article on building trees,
   this hypothesis is based on information we’ve collected about our set of
   species – things like their physical features and the DNA sequences of
   their genes.
   [Are phylogenetic trees only for species?]
   In a phylogenetic tree, the species or groups of interest are found at the
   tips of lines referred to as the tree's branches. For example, the
   phylogenetic tree below represents relationships between five species, A,
   B, C, D, and E, which are positioned at the ends of the branches:
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
--
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The pattern in which the branches connect represents our understanding of
   how the species in the tree evolved from a series of common ancestors.
   Each branch point (also called an internal node) represents a divergence
   event, or splitting apart of a single group into two descendant groups.
--
   giving rise to species A and B, we would find the most recent common
   ancestor of those two species. At the branch point right above the root of
   the tree, we would find the most recent common ancestor of all the species
   in the tree (A, B, C, D, E).
   [Why is this the most recent common ancestor of all the species?]
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, labeled root, which branches (at a branch point) to form species
   E and another line that branches into a pair of double branches. From
   there, the first pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the
   second pair of double branches forms species C and D. The first branch
   point in the tree is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A, B, C, D,
   and E. The point where the tree branches into species A and B is labeled
   Most recent common ancestor of A and B.

   al., CC BY 4.0
   Each horizontal line in our tree represents a series of ancestors, leading
   up to the species at its end. For instance, the line leading up to species
   E represents the species' ancestors since it diverged from the other
   species in the tree. Similarly, the root represents a series of ancestors
   leading up to the most recent common ancestor of all the species in the
   tree.

Which species are more related?

   In a phylogenetic tree, the relatedness of two species has a very specific
   meaning. Two species are more related if they have a more recent common
   ancestor, and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.
--
   ancestor of any pair or group of species. In this method, we start at the
   branch ends carrying the two species of interest and “walk backwards” in
   the tree until we find the point where the species’ lines converge.
   For instance, suppose that we wanted to say whether A and B or B and C are
   more closely related. To do so, we would follow the lines of both pairs of
   species backward in the tree. Since A and B converge at a common ancestor
   first as we move backwards, and B only converges with C after its junction
   point with A, we can say that A and B are more related than B and C.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D. The point where the tree branches
   into species A and B is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A and B. A
   pink line traces from species A back to this point, while a red line
   traces from species B back to this point. The point where the tree
   branches into a pair of double branches is labeled Most recent common
   ancestor of B and C. A red line traces from species B back to this point,
--
   using this method. For instance, we can't say whether A and B are more
   closely related than C and D. That’s because, by default, the horizontal
   axis of the tree doesn't represent time in a direct way. So, we can only
   compare the timing of branching events that occur on the same lineage
   (same direct line from the root of the tree), and not those that occur on
   different lineages.

Some tips for reading phylogenetic trees

   You may see phylogenetic trees drawn in many different formats. Some are
   blocky, like the tree at left below. Others use diagonal lines, like the
   tree at right below. You may also see trees of either kind oriented
   vertically or flipped on their sides, as shown for the blocky tree.
   Three examples of phylogenetic trees. The first tree is horizontal with a
   root on the left and branches forming 90 degree angles before forming
   species on the right hand side. The second tree is similar to the first
   tree, but it is vertical, with the root at the bottom and the species
   listed at the top. The third tree is similar to the second tree, but the
   branches are diagonal.

   al., CC BY 4.0
   The three trees above represent identical relationships among species A,
   B, C, D, and E. You may want to take a moment to convince yourself that
   this is really the case – that is, that no branching patterns or
   recent-ness of common ancestors are different between the two trees. The
   identical information in these different-looking trees reminds us that
   it's the branching pattern (and not the lengths of branches) that's
   meaningful in a typical tree.
   Another critical point about these trees is that if you rotate the
   structures, using one of the branch points as a pivot, you don’t change
   the relationships. So just like the two trees above, which show the same
   relationships even though they are formatted differently, all of the trees
   below show the same relationships among four species:
   A series of vertical phylogenetic trees showing that phylogenetic trees
   can be rotated at a branch, resulting in the same tree. Numbers will be
   assigned to the branches for description, but do not appear in the
   diagram. The first tree begins with a root at the bottom, which splits
   into branches 1 and 2. Branch 1 becomes species W. Branch 2 splits into
   branches 3 and 4. Branch 3 becomes species X. Branch 4 splits into
   branches 5 and 6, which becomes species Y and Z respectively. The species
   are listed from left to right as W, X, Y, and Z. If branch 2 is rotated
   horizontally 180 degrees it results in the same tree, although the species
   are listed from left to right as W, Z, Y, and X. At the bottom of the
   diagram four equal trees are shown, but with rotations occurring at
   different branches.

--
   diagrams. That ordering actually doesn’t give us useful information.
   Instead, it’s the branch structure of each diagram that tells us what we
   need to understand the tree.
   So far, all the trees we've looked at have had nice, clean branching
   patterns, with just two lineages (lines of descent) emerging from each
   branch point. However, you may see trees with a polytomy (poly, many;
   tomy, cuts), meaning a branch point that has three or more different
   species coming off of it2‍ . In general, a polytomy shows where we don't
   have enough information to determine branching order.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. The root branches into a lower branch that
   becomes species U and an upper branch that further splits into two
   branches. The bottom branch splits into two branches, forming species S
--
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   If we later get more information about the species in a tree, we may be
   able to resolve a polytomy using the new information.

Where do these trees come from?

   To generate a phylogenetic tree, scientists often compare and analyze many
   characteristics of the species or other groups involved. These
   characteristics can include external morphology (shape/appearance),
   internal anatomy, behaviors, biochemical pathways, DNA and protein
   sequences, and even the characteristics of fossils.
   To build accurate, meaningful trees, biologists will often use many
   different characteristics (reducing the chances of any one imperfect piece
   of data leading to a wrong tree). Still, phylogenetic trees are
   hypotheses, not definitive answers, and they can only be as good as the
   data available when they're made. Trees are revised and updated over time
--
   particularly true today, as DNA sequencing increases our ability to
   compare genes between species.
   In the next article on building a tree, we’ll see concrete examples of how
   different types of data are used to organize species into phylogenetic
   trees.

       Trees

   A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or
   as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data
   structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections
   between elements, giving a tree graph.

   Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of
   trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices.

   A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends
   containing no closed loops (cycles). In other words, it is a simple,
   undirected, connected, acyclic graph (or, equivalently, a connected
   forest). A tree with n nodes has n-1 graph edges. Conversely, a connected
   graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. All trees are bipartite graphs
   (Skiena 1990, p. 213). Trees with no particular node singled out are
   sometimes called free trees (or unrooted tree), by way of distinguishing
   them from rooted trees (Skiena 1990, Knuth 1997).

   The points of connection are known as forks and the segments as branches.
   Final segments and the nodes at their ends are called tree leaves. A tree
   with two branches at each fork and with one or two tree leaves at the end
   of each branch is called a binary tree.

   A graph can be tested in the Wolfram Language to see if it is a tree using
   TreeGraphQ[g].

--
   Trees are block graphs.

   A tree T has either one node that is a graph center, in which case it is
   called a centered tree, or two adjacent nodes that are graph centers, in
   which case it is called a bicentered tree (Harary 1994, p. 35).

   When a special node is designated to turn a tree into a rooted tree, it is
   called the root (or sometimes "Eve"). In such a tree, each of the nodes
   that is one graph edge further away from a given node is called a child,
   and nodes connected to the same node that are the same distance from the
--

   Note that two branches placed end-to-end are equivalent to a single
   branch, which means for example, that there is only one tree of order 3.
   The number t(n) of nonisomorphic trees of order n=1, 2, ... (where trees
   of orders 1, 2, ..., 6 are illustrated above), are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11,
   23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ... (OEIS A000055).

   The generating functions for the number of rooted trees

                  T(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)T_nx^n                         (1) 
                       =  xexp[sum_(r=1)^(infty)1/rT(x^r)]                (2)

       for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that
   predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules
   inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise
   constant approximation.

   For instance, in the example below, decision trees learn from data to
   approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The
   deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the
   model.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Some advantages of decision trees are:

       * Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.
--
       * Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require
         data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank
         values to be removed. Some tree and algorithm combinations support
         missing values.

       * The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in
         the number of data points used to train the tree.

       * Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the
--
         true model from which the data were generated.

   The disadvantages of decision trees include:

       * Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
         generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms
         such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a
         leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to
         avoid this problem.

       * Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
         might result in a completely different tree being generated. This
         problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.

       * Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but
         piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure.
         Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.

       * The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
         NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple
         concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms
         are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where
         locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms
         cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This
         can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner,
         where the features and samples are randomly sampled with
         replacement.

       * There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do
         not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer
         problems.

       * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
         It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting
         with the decision tree.

1.10.1. Classification¶
--
   (n_samples,), holding the class labels for the training samples:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn import tree
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y = [0, 1]
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

--
   classification.

   Using the Iris dataset, we can construct a tree as follows:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn import tree
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; iris = load_iris()
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X, y = iris.data, iris.target
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)

   Once trained, you can plot the tree with the plot_tree function:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tree.plot_tree(clf)
 [...]

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_iris_dtc_002.png

   Alternative ways to export trees Click for more details

   We can also export the tree in Graphviz format using the export_graphviz
   exporter. If you use the conda package manager, the graphviz binaries and
   the python package can be installed with conda install python-graphviz.
--
   install graphviz.

   Below is an example graphviz export of the above tree trained on the
   entire iris dataset; the results are saved in an output file iris.pdf:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import graphviz
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None)
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; graph.render("iris")
--
   render these plots inline automatically:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None,
 ...                      feature_names=iris.feature_names, 
 ...                      class_names=iris.target_names, 
--
   ../_images/iris.svg ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_iris_dtc_001.png

   Alternatively, the tree can also be exported in textual format with the
   function export_text. This method doesn’t require the installation of
   external libraries and is more compact:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn.tree import export_text
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; iris = load_iris()
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0, max_depth=2)
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decision_tree = decision_tree.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; r = export_text(decision_tree, feature_names=iris['feature_names'])
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(r)

1.10.2. Regression¶

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Decision trees can also be applied to regression problems, using the
   DecisionTreeRegressor class.

--
   point values instead of integer values:

 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn import tree
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X = [[0, 0], [2, 2]]
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = [0.5, 2.5]
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clf.predict([[1, 1]])
--
   estimator may often be increased.

   With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to
   support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes:

--
   This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this
   strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor. If a
   decision tree is fit on an output array Y of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
   then the resulting estimator will:

--
         predict_proba.

   The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in
   Multi-output Decision Tree Regression. In this example, the input X is a
   single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_multioutput_001.png

   The use of multi-output trees for classification is demonstrated in Face
   completion with a multi-output estimators. In this example, the inputs X
   are the pixels of the upper half of faces and the outputs Y are the pixels

         subwindows and multiple output randomized trees, International

1.10.4. Complexity¶

   In general, the run time cost to construct a balanced binary tree is
   \(O(n_{samples}n_{features}\log(n_{samples}))\) and query time
   \(O(\log(n_{samples}))\). Although the tree construction algorithm
   attempts to generate balanced trees, they will not always be balanced.
   Assuming that the subtrees remain approximately balanced, the cost at each
   node consists of searching through \(O(n_{features})\) to find the feature
   that offers the largest reduction in the impurity criterion, e.g. log loss
   (which is equivalent to an information gain). This has a cost of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}\log(n_{samples}))\) at each node, leading to a
   total cost over the entire trees (by summing the cost at each node) of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}^{2}\log(n_{samples}))\).

1.10.5. Tips on practical use¶

       * Decision trees tend to overfit on data with a large number of
         features. Getting the right ratio of samples to number of features
         is important, since a tree with few samples in high dimensional
         space is very likely to overfit.

       * Consider performing dimensionality reduction (PCA, ICA, or Feature
         selection) beforehand to give your tree a better chance of finding
         features that are discriminative.

       * Understanding the decision tree structure will help in gaining more
         insights about how the decision tree makes predictions, which is
         important for understanding the important features in the data.

       * Visualize your tree as you are training by using the export

1.10.6. Tree algorithms: ID3, C4.5, C5.0 and CART¶

   What are all the various decision tree algorithms and how do they differ
   from each other? Which one is implemented in scikit-learn?

   Various decision tree algorithms Click for more details

   ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The
   algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy
   manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information
   gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and
   then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree
   to generalize to unseen data.

--
   must be categorical by dynamically defining a discrete attribute (based on
   numerical variables) that partitions the continuous attribute value into a
   discrete set of intervals. C4.5 converts the trained trees (i.e. the
   output of the ID3 algorithm) into sets of if-then rules. The accuracy of
   each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be
--
   CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is very similar to C4.5, but it
   differs in that it supports numerical target variables (regression) and
   does not compute rule sets. CART constructs binary trees using the feature
   and threshold that yield the largest information gain at each node.

--

   Given training vectors \(x_i \in R^n\), i=1,…, l and a label vector \(y
   \in R^l\), a decision tree recursively partitions the feature space such
   that the samples with the same labels or similar target values are grouped
   together.
--
     classes. It takes the class frequencies of the training data points that
     reached a given leaf \(m\) as their probability. Using the Shannon
     entropy as tree node splitting criterion is equivalent to minimizing the
     log loss (also known as cross-entropy and multinomial deviance) between
     the true labels \(y_i\) and the probabilistic predictions \(T_k(x_i)\)
     of the tree model \(T\) for class \(k\).

     To see this, first recall that the log loss of a tree model \(T\)
     computed on a dataset \(D\) is defined as follows:

--
     where \(D\) is a training dataset of \(n\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\).

     In a classification tree, the predicted class probabilities within leaf
     nodes are constant, that is: for all \((x_i, y_i) \in Q_m\), one has:
     \(T_k(x_i) = p_{mk}\) for each class \(k\).

1.10.9. Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning¶

   Minimal cost-complexity pruning is an algorithm used to prune a tree to
   avoid over-fitting, described in Chapter 3 of [BRE]. This algorithm is
   parameterized by \(\alpha\ge0\) known as the complexity parameter. The
   complexity parameter is used to define the cost-complexity measure,
   \(R_\alpha(T)\) of a given tree \(T\):

   \[R_\alpha(T) = R(T) + \alpha|\widetilde{T}|\]
--
   weighted impurity of the terminal nodes for \(R(T)\). As shown above, the
   impurity of a node depends on the criterion. Minimal cost-complexity
   pruning finds the subtree of \(T\) that minimizes \(R_\alpha(T)\).

   The cost complexity measure of a single node is
   \(R_\alpha(t)=R(t)+\alpha\). The branch, \(T_t\), is defined to be a tree
   where node \(t\) is its root. In general, the impurity of a node is
   greater than the sum of impurities of its terminal nodes, \(R(T_t)&amp;lt;R(t)\).
--
   \(\alpha_{eff}(t)=\frac{R(t)-R(T_t)}{|T|-1}\). A non-terminal node with
   the smallest value of \(\alpha_{eff}\) is the weakest link and will be
   pruned. This process stops when the pruned tree’s minimal \(\alpha_{eff}\)
   is greater than the ccp_alpha parameter.

   Trees grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. Like all plants,
   trees manufacture their food through photosynthesis. Trees are in the
   family of woody plants which have cambium, a special layer of cells that
   allow the tree to increase in girth and are self supporting with a single
   stem. Trees are perennials and can live for many years. The oldest known
   tree species is the Great Basin bristlecone pine, which is believed to
   reach ages of over 5,000 years old!

   Food for trees is produced through a complex system starting with the
   leaves. Leaves produce sugar as a result of photosynthesis which combines
   carbon dioxide and sunlight. The by-product of photosynthesis that Trees
   produce is oxygen—a vital resource for other living organisms. Sugar that
   is produced runs down through the tree, under the bark down the trunk and
   to the roots of the tree. The sugar combines at the roots with minerals
   and water in the ground to move back up the tree trunk and under the bark
   back to the leaves to which starts the cycle of photosynthesis again.
   Along the way, minerals, water and sugar stimulate the growth and
   development of the tree or assist in its reproduction.

Tree Types
--
   Trees can divided into two categories: deciduous and coniferous.

   Deciduous trees are also known as broadleaf trees because the leaves are
   generally larger and wider than those of conifers. The larger leaf size
   means a greater surface area for photosynthesis, but it also means the
   leaf is too fragile to withstand winter conditions. Therefore, most
   deciduous trees drop their leaves in autumn.

   Coniferous trees keep their leaves throughout the year, shedding only the
   oldest leaves. Usually these leaves are lower down on the tree and do not
   receive as much sunlight as newly developed leaves higher up. Some of the
   best-known members of the conifer family are pines, spruces, firs, and
--
   roots

   The crown of the tree is made up of the leaves and branches.

   The trunk of the tree supports the crown and serves as a highway for food
   made in the leaves to travel to the roots and for water and nutrients from
   the roots to travel to the leaves.
--
   The root collar is located at the base of the trunk just above where the
   roots join. Also called the root flare, due to the flared shape on some
   tree species, the root collar must always remain above ground when
   planting and mulching.

   The roots of the tree support the trunk and crown, and also anchor the
   tree in the soil. They serve as a storage facility during the winter for
   the food produced by the leaves during the growing season. The roots also
   absorb water and nutrients from the soil for use by the tree.

   Many wildlife species depend on trees for food, water, cover, or places to
   raise their young. You can help wildlife by planting trees and creating
   habitat in your community!

   tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most
   plants classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing
   woody tissues, and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs,
   called branches.

   To many, the word tree evokes images of such ancient, powerful, and
   majestic structures as oaks and sequoias, the latter being among the most
   massive and longest-living organisms in the world. Although the majority
   of Earth’s terrestrial biomass is represented by trees, the fundamental
   importance of these seemingly ubiquitous plants for the very existence and
   diversity of life on Earth is perhaps not fully appreciated. The biosphere
   is dependent on the metabolism, death, and recycling of plants, especially
   trees. Their vast trunks and root systems store carbon dioxide, move
   water, and produce oxygen that is released into the atmosphere. The
   organic matter of the soil develops primarily from decayed leaves, twigs,
   branches, roots, and fallen trees, all of which recycle nitrogen, carbon,
   oxygen, and other important nutrients. There are few organisms as
   important as trees for maintaining Earth’s ecology.

   This article discusses the historical, popular, and botanical
   classifications of trees, their evolution, their importance to humans, and
   their general structure and patterns of growth. For more information on
   the three botanical groups that include trees, see fern (e.g., the tree
   ferns), gymnosperm (including conifers), and angiosperm (the flowering
   plants). For general information on plants, see plant.

Classification of trees

   The ancient Greeks developed a classification about 300 bce in which
   plants were grouped according to their general form—that is, as trees,
   shrubs, undershrubs, and vines. This classification was used for almost
   1,000 years. Modern classifications of plants attempt to assign a plant to

   include trees and shrubs in 7 extant families and 545 species. Familiar
   representatives are araucarias, cedars, cypresses, Douglas firs, firs,

   Dominating Earth’s present flora are the angiosperms, with about 300,000
   species, among which are the majority of the world’s trees. Angiosperms
   are sometimes divided on the basis of a group of characteristics into two
   major groups: the monocotyledons and the eudicotyledons. The most numerous
   of the monocotyledonous trees are palms; others include agaves, aloes,
   dracaenas, screw pines, and yuccas. By far the greatest number of tree
   species are eudicotyledons; they are represented by such familiar groups
   as birches, elms, hollies, maples, oaks, poplars, ashes, and willows.

Ecological and evolutionary classification

   The tree is not an immutable biological category but rather a human
   concept based on visual criteria. Perhaps a general definition would
   describe a tree as a perennial woody plant that develops along a single
   main trunk to a height of at least 4.5 metres (15 feet) at maturity. This
   may be contrasted with a shrub, which might be loosely defined as a woody
--
   in one area of the world might not necessarily do so in other regions,
   since a variety of stresses shape the habit of the mature plant. Thus, a
   given woody species may be a tree in one set of habitats within its range
   and a shrub elsewhere. For example, the spruce and fir may thrive in the
   tree form at the base of a mountain but assume a shrub form near the
   mountaintop, the variation due principally to stresses exerted by such
   environmental conditions as altitude, temperature, and oxygen tension.

   As seen in the section above, trees are found among many plant families
   that also include shrubs and herbs, so that the concept of tree is not a
   phylogenetic one. Further, there is no clear consensus as to whether the
   tree form is the advanced or primitive condition. Some paleobotanists
   suggest that trees are the most primitive members within these plant
   families. However, tree forms are found in all the vascular plants, from
   the club mosses and ferns to the gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is
   furthermore true that, among the flowering plants, trees are found not
   only among the most primitive members (order Magnoliales) but also among
   the more specialized, or advanced, members, such as the roses (order
--

   Consequently, from both a taxonomic and a phylogenetic perspective, the
   tree is an artificial category. On an ecological basis, however, the tree
   can be recognized as a natural construct, as it represents an adaptive
   strategy by many different taxa to exploit and dominate the habitat above
--
   plant’s form to allow specialization of function. This requires
   physiological and morphological complexity as well as biological
   optimization. If all the tissues of massive tree trunks were alive, for
   example, the physiological cost of maintaining these structures in the
   living state would be enormous and probably unattainable. An elegant

                           What is a Tree? How Does it Work?

   Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, the usually wider
   and thinner-walled layer, called springwood, grows. In the summer, a
   thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
   typical in temperate forest trees.

Tree Physiology

     * A tree is a tall plant with woody tissue. Trees gather light for
       photosynthesis through their leaves; this process creates “food” for
       the tree.
     * Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and serves only to support the
       weight of the tree crown. The outside layers of the tree trunk are the
       only living portion. The cambium produces new wood and new bark.
     * The band of tissue outside of the cambium is the phloem. Phloem
       transports new materials (the sugars created from photosynthesis) from
       the crown to the roots. Dead phloem tissue becomes the bark of a tree.
     * The band of tissue just inside of the cambium is the xylem, which
       transports water from the roots to the crown. Dead xylem tissue forms
       the heartwood, or the wood we use for many different purposes.
     * Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, usually a
       wider and thinner-walled layer called springwood forms. In the summer,
       a thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
       typical in temperate forest trees.

Parts of a Tree

     * Twigs and Branches – support structures for leaves, flowers and
       fruits.
     * Crown – the upper part of the tree composed of leaves, twigs,

   Leaves fall in autumn as part of a tree’s preparation for winter dormancy.
   Because it is too cold for water to remain in the plant tissues (freezing
   water would rupture cells in the tree), and because the water in the soil
   is frozen and cannot be absorbed, trees shut down major processes in the
   cold months. Deciduous trees drop their leaves; conifers have strategies
   to maintain their needles during the winter.

   North East Lincolnshire Council confirmed the road would be closed for
   "most of Monday" to allow debris to be cleared, adding crews worked
