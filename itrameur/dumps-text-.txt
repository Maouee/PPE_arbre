   [IMG]A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia [IMG]The original Encyclopédie (1752) used a tree diagram to
   show the way in which its subjects were ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the
   hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a
   "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree,
   with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are
   listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member
   is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting node. But the
   converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root
   node.

   The names of relationships between nodes model the kinship terminology of
   family relations. The gender-neutral names "parent" and "child" have
   largely displaced the older "father" and "son" terminology. The term
   "uncle" is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the
   parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms like
   "ommer".^[1]

     * A node's "parent" is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e.
       closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
     * "Sibling" ("brother" or "sister") nodes share the same parent node.
     * A node's "uncles" (sometimes "ommers") are siblings of that node's
       parent.
     * A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an
       "ancestor". The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of the
       ancestor node.

   In the example, "encyclopedia" is the parent of "science" and "culture",
   its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children of "culture",
   which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also,
   "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of "science",
   "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and "craft", as
   leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a
   language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example
   being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase,
   with each in turn having other components which have other components),
   the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees
   of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the
   Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any
   other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

   For a formal definition see set theory, and for a generalization in which
   children are not necessarily successors, see prefix order.

Representing trees[edit]

   There are many ways of visually representing tree structures. Almost
   always, these boil down to variations, or combinations, of a few basic
   styles:

  Classical node-link diagrams[edit]

   Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line
   segments:

   encyclopedia
   /         \       
   culture   science 
   /   \     
   art craft 

  Nested sets[edit]

   Nested sets that use enclosure or containment to show parenthood; examples
   include TreeMaps, fractal maps, and Euler diagrams:

   [IMG]   encyclopedia  
   [IMG]                 [IMG]  
   [IMG] culture                
   [IMG]         [IMG] science 
   art   craft         

  Layered "icicle" diagrams[edit]

   Layered "icicle" diagrams that use alignment/adjacency.

   +-----------------------+
   | encyclopedia          |
   |-----------------------|
   | culture     | science |
   |-------------+---------|
   | art | craft |         |
   +-----------------------+

  Outlines and tree views[edit]

   Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called "outlines" or
   "tree views".

   An outline:

           encyclopedia

                        culture

                                     art
                                     craft

                        science

   A tree view:

     * encyclopedia
          * culture
               * art
               * craft
          * science

  Nested parentheses[edit]

   See also: Newick format and Dyck language

   A correspondence to nested parentheses was first noticed by Sir Arthur
   Cayley:

   ((art,craft)culture,science)encyclopedia
   or
   encyclopedia(culture(art,craft),science)

  Radial trees[edit]

   See also: Radial tree

   Trees can also be represented radially:

   art     craft 
         \ /     
   culture 
   |       
   encyclopedia
   |       
   science

   Tree Equity Score
   Ensuring tree cover in cities is equitably distributed
   Photo: Rob Crandall / Shutterstock
   Using Data Tools to Create Tree Equity

   The story is the same in nearly every city across the United States. With
   few exceptions, trees are sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged and
   neighborhoods of color and more prominent in wealthier, whiter
   neighborhoods. Redlining policies, dating back to the 1930s, helped
   lay the groundwork for this inequity.

   American Forests is focused on addressing this inequity by focusing
   resources in neighborhoods of highest need. It’s our moral imperative to
   do so, given how many life-saving and quality of life benefits trees
   provide people. That is why we are working to create Tree Equity, which is
   about ensuring that all people experience the benefits of trees. One of
   the ways we are doing this is with our Tree Equity Score tool. It provides
   a social-equity-focused narrative, goals and a guide path for building
   understanding, commitment and action around Tree Equity. It is also free
   and easy to access.

Where is Tree Equity Score Available?

   Tree Equity Score covers all urban areas in United States, including
   Hawai’i and Alaska. 80% of the population lives in urban areas, which
   means over 260 million people can find a score for their neighborhood.

   See Your City's Tree Equity Score
   What Do the Scores Mean?
   Each score indicates whether there are enough trees in a neighborhood for
   everyone to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that
   trees provide. Scores are based on tree canopy, surface temperature,
   income, employment, race, age, language and health factors. A
   0-to-100-point system makes it easy to understand how a community fares.

Who Can Use Tree Equity Score?

   Tree Equity Score can be used by neighborhood organizations,
   U.S. congressional leaders and everybody in between. And it can be used by
   a variety of sectors, such as urban forestry and public health, given the
   role trees play in slowing climate change and improving health and
   wellbeing. Some of the uses are:

   Advocacy
   Make the case for federal, state and local policies, programs and funding
   related to protecting existing trees and planting new trees. The Tucson
   City Council used the methodology from Tree Equity Score to create a
   mapping tool for making decisions about how to invest in green
   infrastructure, such as tree planting and green stormwater basin
   installations.
   City Planning
   Urban land-use planners and others can use the scores to decide where and
   how to invest in forestry and infrastructure. The Tucson City Council and
   Mayor Regina Romero agreed in April 2021 to adopt the Tucson Tree Equity
   Score as the primary tool to prioritize investments for the city’s urban
   forestry initiative and infrastructure projects.
   Forestry Programs
   Use the scores to take a fresh look at an existing urban forestry program.
   Does the program prioritize planting trees in low-scoring neighborhoods?
   Scores can help track progress related to urban forestry programs and
   initiatives.

   [IMG]An abstract syntax tree for the following code for the Euclidean
   algorithm:

 while b ≠ 0:
     if a @gt; b:
         a := a - b
     else:
         b := b - a
 return a

   An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science
   to represent the structure of a program or code snippet. It is a tree
   representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source
   code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a
   construct occurring in the text. It is sometimes called just a syntax
   tree.

   The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every
   detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or
   content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit
   in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate
   nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then statement
   may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

   This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees,
   traditionally designated parse trees. Parse trees are typically built by a
   parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once
   built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent
   processing, e.g., contextual analysis.

   Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program
   transformation systems.

Application in compilers[edit]

   Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to
   represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of
   the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an
   intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the
   compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the
   compiler.

  Motivation[edit]

   An AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the
   compilation process:

     * An AST can be edited and enhanced with information such as properties
       and annotations for every element it contains. Such editing and
       annotation is impossible with the source code of a program, since it
       would imply changing it.
     * Compared to the source code, an AST does not include inessential
       punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.).
     * An AST usually contains extra information about the program, due to
       the consecutive stages of analysis by the compiler. For example, it
       may store the position of each element in the source code, allowing
       the compiler to print useful error messages.

   ASTs are needed because of the inherent nature of programming languages
   and their documentation. Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order
   to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a
   context-free grammar (CFG). However, there are often aspects of
   programming languages that a CFG can't express, but are part of the
   language and are documented in its specification. These are details that
   require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example,
   if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the
   names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a
   language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually
   requires some context. Another example is duck typing, where the type of
   an element can change depending on context. Operator overloading is yet
   another case where correct usage and final function are context-dependent.

  Design[edit]

   The design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler
   and its expected features.

   Core requirements include the following:

     * Variable types must be preserved, as well as the location of each
       declaration in source code.
     * The order of executable statements must be explicitly represented and
       well defined.
     * Left and right components of binary operations must be stored and
       correctly identified.
     * Identifiers and their assigned values must be stored for assignment
       statements.

   These requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST.

   Some operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms
   for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily
   large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from
   the command shell. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in
   such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition
   of an unknown quantity of children.

   To support compiler verification it should be possible to unparse an AST
   into source code form. The source code produced should be sufficiently
   similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon
   recompilation. The AST is used intensively during semantic analysis, where
   the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and
   the language. The compiler also generates symbol tables based on the AST
   during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows
   verification of the correctness of the program.

   After verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code
   generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate
   representation (IR), sometimes called an intermediate language, for the
   code generation.

Other usages[edit]

  AST differencing[edit]

   AST differencing, or for short tree differencing, consists of computing
   the list of differences between two ASTs.^[1] This list of differences is
   typically called an edit script. The edit script directly refers to the
   AST of the code. For instance, an edit action may result in the addition
   of a new AST node representing a function.

  Clone detection[edit]

   An AST is a powerful abstraction to perform code clone detection.^[2]

   [IMG]Parse tree to SAAB

   A parse tree or parsing tree^[1] or derivation tree or concrete syntax
   tree is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of
   a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree
   itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical
   syntax, the term syntax tree is more common.

   Concrete syntax trees reflect the syntax of the input language, making
   them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming.
   Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse
   trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of
   constituents.

   Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency
   relation of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) or the
   dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated
   for sentences in natural languages (see natural language processing), as
   well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming
   languages.

   A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in
   transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic
   expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the
   form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated
   by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further
   transformational rules.^[2] A set of possible parse trees for a
   syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a "parse forest."^[3]

Nomenclature[edit]

   [IMG]A simple parse tree

   A parse tree is made up of nodes and branches.^[4] In the picture the
   parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of
   the leaf nodes (John, ball, the, hit). In a parse tree, each node is
   either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. In the above example, S
   is a root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, while John, ball, the, and hit
   are all leaf nodes.

   Nodes can also be referred to as parent nodes and child nodes. A parent
   node is one which has at least one other node linked by a branch under it.
   In the example, S is a parent of both NP and VP. A child node is one which
   has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch
   of the tree. Again from our example, hit is a child node of V.

   A nonterminal function is a function (node) which is either a root or a
   branch in that tree whereas a terminal function is a function (node) in a
   parse tree which is a leaf.

   For binary trees (where each parent node has two immediate child nodes),
   the number of possible parse trees for a sentence with n words is given by
   the Catalan number C_{n}.

Constituency-based parse trees[edit]

   The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars (phrase
   structure grammars) distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes.
   The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar,
   while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories. The image below
   represents a constituency-based parse tree; it shows the syntactic
   structure of the English sentence John hit the ball:

   Parse tree PSG

   The parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each
   of the leaf nodes (John, hit, the, ball). The following abbreviations are
   used in the tree:

                           * S for sentence, the top-level structure in this
                             example

                           * NP for noun phrase. The first (leftmost) NP, a
                             single noun "John", serves as the subject of the
                             sentence. The second one is the object of the
                             sentence.

                           * VP for verb phrase, which serves as the
                             predicate

                           * V for verb. In this case, it's a transitive verb
                             hit.

                           * D for determiner, in this instance the definite
                             article "the"

                           * N for noun

   Each node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf
   node.^[5] A root node is a node that does not have any branches on top of
   it. Within a sentence, there is only ever one root node. A branch node is
   a parent node that connects to two or more child nodes. A leaf node,
   however, is a terminal node that does not dominate other nodes in the
   tree. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, and John (N), hit
   (V), the (D), and ball (N) are all leaf nodes. The leaves are the lexical
   tokens of the sentence. A parent node is one that has at least one other
   node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both N
   and VP. A child node is one that has at least one node directly above it
   to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, hit is a
   child node of V. The terms mother and daughter are also sometimes used for
   this relationship.

Dependency-based parse trees[edit]

   The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars^[6] see all nodes
   as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between
   terminal and non-terminal categories. They are simpler on average than
   constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes. The
   dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows:

                                     Parse tree DG

   This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories (S, VP, and NP) seen in the
   constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree,
   constituent structure is acknowledged. Any complete sub-tree of the tree
   is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the
   subject noun John and the object noun phrase the ball as constituents just
   like the constituency-based parse tree does.

   The constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the
   additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse
   trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate.

Phrase markers[edit]

   Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early transformational
   generative grammar, as developed by Noam Chomsky and others. A phrase
   marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by
   applying phrase structure rules. Then, this application may undergo
   further transformations.

   Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees (as in the above
   section on constituency-based parse trees), but are often given instead in
   the form of "bracketed expressions", which occupy less space in the
   memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the
   constituency-based tree given above may be something like :

           {\displaystyle [_{S}\ [_{\mathit {N}}\ {\text{John}}]\ [_{\mathit
           {VP}}\ [_{V}\ {\text{hit}}]\ [_{\mathit {NP}}\ [_{\mathit {D}}\
           {\text{the}}]\ [_{N}\ {\text{ball}}]]]]}

   As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount
   of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points
   that the query author wishes to illustrate.

                              What is Syntax Tree?

   Compiler DesignProgramming LanguagesComputer Programming

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Tree in which each leaf node describes an operand @amp; each interior node an
   operator. The syntax tree is shortened form of the Parse Tree.

   Example1 − Draw Syntax Tree for the string a + b ∗ c − d.

   Rules for constructing a syntax tree

   Each node in a syntax tree can be executed as data with multiple fields.
   In the node for an operator, one field recognizes the operator and the
   remaining field includes a pointer to the nodes for the operands. The
   operator is known as the label of the node. The following functions are
   used to create the nodes of the syntax tree for the expressions with
   binary operators. Each function returns a pointer to the recently
   generated node.

     * mknode (op, left, right) − It generates an operator node with label op
       and two field including pointers to left and right.

     * mkleaf (id, entry) − It generates an identifier node with label id and
       the field including the entry, a pointer to the symbol table entry for
       the identifier.

     * mkleaf (num, val) − It generates a number node with label num and a
       field including val, the value of the number. For example, construct a
       syntax tree for an expression a − 4 + c. In this sequence, p_1, p_2, …
       . . p_5are pointers to the symbol table entries for identifier 'a' and
       'c' respectively.

 p_1− mkleaf (id, entry a);
 p_2− mkleaf (num, 4);
 p_3− mknode ( ′−′, p_1, p_2)
 p_4− mkleaf(id, entry c)
 p_5− mknode(′+′, p_3, p_4);

   The tree is generated in a bottom-up fashion. The function calls mkleaf
   (id, entry a) and mkleaf (num 4) construct the leaves for a and 4. The
   pointers to these nodes are stored using p_1and p_2. The call mknodes
   (′−′, p_1, p_2 ) then make the interior node with the leaves for a and 4
   as children. The syntax tree will be

   Syntax Directed Translation of Syntax Trees

   Production        Semantic Action                              
   E → E^(1) + E^(2) {E. VAL = Node (+, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL)}  
   E → E^(1) ∗ E^(2) {E. VAL = Node (∗, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL)}) 
   E → (E^(1))       {E. VAL = E^(1). VAL}                        
   E → E^(1)         {E. VAL = UNARY (−, E^(1). VAL}              
   E → id            {E. VAL = Leaf (id)}                         

   Node (+, 𝐄^(𝟏), 𝐕𝐀𝐋, 𝐄^(𝟐). 𝐕𝐀𝐋) will create a node labeled +.

   E^(1). VAL @amp;E^(2). VAL are left @amp; right children of this node.

   Similarly, Node (∗, E^(1). VAL, E^(2). VAL) will make the syntax as −

   Function UNARY (−, E^(1). VAL)will make a node – (unary minus) @amp; E^(1).
   VAL will be the only child of it.

   Function LEAF (id) will create a Leaf node with label id.

   Example2 − Construct a syntax tree for the expression.

   a = b ∗ −c + d

   Solution

   Example3 − Construct a syntax tree for a statement.

   If a = b then b = 2 * c

   Solution

   Example4 − Consider the following code. Draw its syntax Tree

   If x @gt; 0 then x = 2 * (a + 1) else x = x + 1.

   Example5 − Draw syntax tree for following arithmetic expression a * (b +
   c) – d /2. Also, write given expression in postfix form.

   Postfix Notation

   a b c + * d 2 / -

   A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart
   representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More
   detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as
   genograms.

Representations of family history[edit]

   Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a
   pedigree or ancestry chart. Family trees are often presented with the
   oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at
   the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an
   individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a
   tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry
   charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear
   to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the
   descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these
   formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular
   surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include
   all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which
   represents the reliance on marriage to link dynasties together.

   The passage of time can also be included to illustrate ancestry and
   descent. A time scale is often used, expanding radially across the center,
   divided into decades. Children of the parent form branches around the
   center and their names are plotted in their birth year on the time scale.
   Spouses' names join children's names and nuclear families of parents and
   children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are
   often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the
   natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there
   can be great great grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living
   relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear
   adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a
   living family tree.^[citation needed]

   The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse
   in medieval art,^[1] used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms
   of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical
   use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely
   patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods
   in Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium ("On the Genealogy of the Gods
   of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.^[2]

Common formats[edit]

   In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as
   a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and
   document ancestry and descent.

  Ahnentafel[edit]

   Main article: Ahnentafel
   [IMG]An ahnentafel family tree displaying an ancestor chart of Sigmund
   Christoph, Graf von Zeil und Trauchburg

   An Ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table") is a genealogical numbering
   system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of
   ascent:

    1. Subject (or proband)
    2. Father
    3. Mother
    4. Paternal grandfather
    5. Paternal grandmother
    6. Maternal grandfather
    7. Maternal grandmother

   and so on, back through the generations. Apart from the subject or
   proband, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male,
   and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this scheme, the number of any
   person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is
   double the person's number plus one. This system can also be displayed as
   a tree:

  Fan chart[edit]

   name cloud gramplet on the bottom

   A fan chart features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the
   subject is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each
   side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth.
   Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

Graph theory[edit]

   While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in
   general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since
   distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor
   on both their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must
   be born before their child, an individual cannot be their own ancestor,
   and thus there are no loops. In this regard, ancestry forms a directed
   acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent
   (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son
   relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry
   chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and
   one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on
   the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a
   person can have any number of children or none at all.

Notable examples[edit]

   [IMG]Family trees are an age-old phenomenon. This example dates from the
   sixteenth century.^[3]

   Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and
   cultures throughout the world.

  Africa[edit]

   In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from King
   Solomon via the Queen of Sheba. Through this claim, the family traced
   their descent back to the House of David.

   The genealogy of Ancient Egyptian ruling dynasties was recorded from the
   beginnings of the Pharaonic era c. 3000 BC to the end of the Ptolomaic
   Kingdom; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family
   lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

   Elsewhere in Africa, oral traditions of genealogical recording
   predominate. Members of the Keita dynasty of Mali, for example, have had
   their pedigrees sung by griots during annual ceremonies since the 14th
   century. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, many ruling clans—most notably those
   descended from Oduduwa—claim descent from the legendary King Kisra. Here
   too, pedigrees are recited by griots attached to the royal courts.^[4]

  The Americas[edit]

   In some pre-contact Native American civilizations, genealogical records of
   ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over
   several centuries or longer.

  East Asia[edit]

   There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but
   these do not form a single, unified family tree. Additionally, it is
   unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become
   mythological.

   In Japan, the ancestry of the Imperial Family is traced back to the
   mythological origins of Japan. The connection to persons from the
   established historical record only begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

   The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher
   and educator Confucius (551–479 BC), who is descended from King Tang
   (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and
   includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving
   more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and
   revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was
   printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation
   Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the
   Chinese thinker. This latest edition was expected to include some 1.3
   million living members who are scattered around the world today.^[5]

  Europe and West Asia[edit]

   Before the Dark Ages, in the Greco-Roman world, some reliable pedigrees
   dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first
   millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further.
   Roman clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure
   of their society and were the basis of their intricate system of personal
   names. However, there was a break in the continuity of record-keeping at
   the end of Classical Antiquity. Records of the lines of succession of the
   Popes and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have
   survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single
   families. Refer to descent from antiquity.

   Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West Asian origin can
   reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first
   millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity
   or mythological ancestors. In Europe, for example, the pedigree of Niall
   Noígíallach would be a contender for the longest, through Conn of the
   Hundred Battles (fl. 123 AD)^[citation needed]; in the legendary history
   of Ireland, he is further descended from Breogán, and ultimately from
   Adam, through the sons of Noah.

   Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which
   includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a
   13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and
   purportedly back to the legendary King David, as documented by Neil
   Rosenstein in his book The Lurie Legacy.^[6] The 1999 edition of the
   Guinness Book of Records recorded the Lurie family in the "longest
   lineage" category as one of the oldest-known living families in the world
   today.^[7]

   Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in
   religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent
   from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In
   the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical
   persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. Also according to
   the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed
   at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common
   Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the
   Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad
   greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new
   dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their
   legitimacy.

  Elsewhere[edit]

   Elsewhere, in many human cultures, clan and tribal associations are based
   on claims of common ancestry, although detailed documentation of those
   origins is often very limited.

  Global[edit]

   Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022,
   scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that
   unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history,
   ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for
   estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked
   trees along the genome, a tree-sequence,^[clarification needed] which has
   been described as the largest "human family tree".^[8]^[9]^[10]

Other uses[edit]

   The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced "family trees" of
   rock bands. In this instance, the entries represent a membership of
   certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family
   relationships. Several books have been produced with his family
   trees,^[11] which in turn have led to a BBC television series about them,
   including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.^[12]

   Another common use is in the creation of episcopal trees in Christian
   traditions that believe in apostolic succession. In this case, the
   connection is not made through blood, but through the order of succession
   of bishops.

   Christmas tree decorated with lights, stars and glass balls. Wrapped
   presents are under treeChristmas tree decorated with lights, stars, and
   glass balls [IMG]Glade jul by Viggo Johansen (1891) [IMG]Typical North
   American family decorating Christmas tree (c. 1970s)

   A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such
   as a spruce, pine or fir, or an artificial tree of similar appearance,
   associated with the celebration of Christmas.^[1]

   The custom was developed in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia), where Protestant
   Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.^[2]^[3]^[4] The tree
   was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples,
   wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".^[2] Moravian Christians began to
   illuminate Christmas trees with candles,^[5] which were often replaced by
   Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.^[6] Today, there is
   a wide variety of traditional and modern ornaments, such as garlands,
   baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or star might be placed at the
   top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem,
   respectively, from the Nativity.^[7]^[8] Edible items such as gingerbread,
   chocolate, and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from
   the tree's branches with ribbons. The Christmas tree has been historically
   regarded as a custom of the Lutheran Churches and only in 1982 did the
   Catholic Church erect the Vatican Christmas Tree.^[9]

   In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected
   on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve
   depending on the country;^[10] customs of the same faith hold that the two
   traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree,
   are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day,
   Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some
   denominations.^[10]^[11]

   The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the "Yule-tree", especially
   in discussions of its folkloric origins.^[12]^[13]^[14]

History[edit]

  Origin of the modern Christmas tree[edit]

   [IMG]Martin Luther is depicted with his family and friends in front of a
   Christmas tree on Christmas Eve

   Modern Christmas trees originated in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia) during the
   Renaissance in early modern Europe.^[2]^[3] Its 16th-century origins are
   sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who
   is said to have first added lighted candles to an evergreen
   tree.^[15]^[16]^[17] The Christmas tree was first recorded to be used by
   German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a
   Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1539, under
   the leadership of the Protestant Reformer Martin Bucer.^[18]^[19] The
   Moravian Christians put lighted candles on those trees."^[5]^[20] The
   earliest known firmly dated representation of a Christmas tree is on the
   keystone sculpture of a private home in Turckheim, Alsace (then part of
   the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, today France), with the date
   1576.^[21]

  Possible predecessors[edit]

   Modern Christmas trees have been related to the "tree of paradise" of
   medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration
   and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree
   decorated with apples (representing fruit from the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil and thus to the original sin that Christ took away) and
   round white wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as
   a setting for the play.^[6] Like the Christmas crib, the Paradise tree was
   later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as
   shiny red balls.^[13]^[14]^[22]^[23]^[24]^[25]

     Fir trees decorated with apples served as the central prop for the
     paradise play, a kind of folk religious drama often performed on
     December 24 These props were called paradise trees, and some researchers
     believe they were the forerunners of the Christmas tree

   ^[26]

   At the end of the Middle Ages, an early predecessor appears referred in
   the 15th century Regiment of the Cistercian Alcobaça Monastery in
   Portugal. The Regiment of the local high-Sacristans of the Cistercian
   Order refers to what may be considered the oldest references to the
   Christmas tree: "Note on how to put the Christmas branch, scilicet: On the
   Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you
   shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of
   the laurel, specifically as you have seen, and in every orange you shall
   put a candle, and hang the Branch by a rope in the pole, which shall be by
   the candle of the high altar."^[27]

   [IMG]Yggdrasil, in Norse cosmology, is an immense and central sacred tree.

   Other sources have offered a connection between the symbolism of the first
   documented Christmas trees in Germany around 1600 and the trees of
   pre-Christian traditions, though this claim has been disputed.^[28]
   According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, "The use of evergreen trees,
   wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the
   ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the
   pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the
   Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at
   the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the
   birds during Christmas time."^[29]

   It is commonly believed that ancient Romans used to decorate their houses
   with evergreen trees to celebrate Saturnalia,^[30] although there are no
   historical records of that.^[31] In the poem Epithalamium by Catullus, he
   tells of the gods decorating the home of Peleus with trees, including
   laurel and cypress. Later Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom speak of
   the use of evergreen trees to adorn Christian houses.^[32]

   The Vikings and Saxons worshiped trees.^[30] The story of Saint Boniface
   cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century
   among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that
   an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how
   its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to
   heaven.^[33]^[a]

  Historical practices by region[edit]

    Estonia, Latvia, and Germany[edit]

   Tallinn Christmas Market in Estonia

   Left: Tallinn Christmas Market in Estonia; Right: Christmas tree with
   Hanukkah Menorah next to it in Pariser Platz

   Customs of erecting decorated trees in winter time can be traced to
   Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era guilds in Northern Germany and
   Livonia. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas
   Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the
   apprentices and children. In Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia), in
   1441, 1442, 1510, and 1514, the Brotherhood of Blackheads erected a tree
   for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now Tallinn) and Riga. On
   the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree
   was taken to the Town Hall Square, where the members of the brotherhood
   danced around it.^[34]

   A Bremen guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with
   "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels, and paper flowers" was erected in the
   guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected
   the dainties on Christmas Day.^[35] In 1584, the pastor and chronicler
   Balthasar Russow in his Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt (1584) wrote of an
   established tradition of setting up a decorated spruce at the market
   square, where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first
   sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

   After the Protestant Reformation, such trees are seen in the houses of
   upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic Christmas
   cribs. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes
   in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern
   tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the
   present-day, the churches and homes of Protestants and Catholics feature
   both Christmas cribs and Christmas trees.^[36]

    Poland[edit]

   Main article: Podłaźniczka
   [IMG]The hanging of a podłaźniczka during Christmastide is an old Polish
   folk custom (2020).

   In Poland, there is a folk tradition dating back to an old Slavic
   pre-Christian custom of suspending a branch of fir, spruce, or pine from
   the ceiling rafters, called podłaźniczka, during the time of the Koliada
   winter festival.^[37] The branches were decorated with apples, nuts,
   acorns, and stars made of straw. In more recent times, the decorations
   also included colored paper cutouts (wycinanki), wafers, cookies, and
   Christmas baubles. According to old pagan beliefs, the branch's powers
   were linked to good harvest and prosperity.^[38]

   The custom was practiced by the peasants until the early 20th century,
   particularly in the regions of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia.^[39] Most
   often the branches were hung above the wigilia dinner table on Christmas
   Eve. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the tradition over time was almost
   completely replaced by the later German practice of decorating a standing
   Christmas tree.^[40]

  18th to early 20th centuries[edit]

    Adoption by European nobility[edit]

   [IMG]German Christmas tree, book illustration (1888)

   In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility
   and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Introduced by Fanny von
   Arnstein and popularized by Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg the
   Christmas tree reached Vienna in 1814 during the Congress of Vienna, and
   the custom spread across Austria in the following years.^[41] In France,
   the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchesse d'Orléans.
   In Denmark, a newspaper company claims that the first attested Christmas
   tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the
   aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to
   the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1865. He had published a
   fairy tale called The Fir-Tree in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir tree
   being used as a Christmas tree.^[42]

    Adoption by country or region[edit]

      Germany[edit]

   [IMG]A German Christmas tree in a room at Versailles turned into a
   military hospital

   By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the
   upper Rhineland, but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles,
   expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th
   century.

   Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas
   tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained
   confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The
   custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way
   of Prussian officials who emigrated there following the Congress of
   Vienna.

   In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of
   German culture and of Gemütlichkeit, especially among emigrants
   overseas.^[43]

   A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's
   decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals
   during the Franco-Prussian War. Only at the start of the 20th century did
   Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit
   form.^[44]

      Slovenia[edit]

   Early Slovenian custom dating back to around the 17th century was to
   suspend the tree either upright or upside-down above the well, a corner of
   the dinner table, in the backyard, or from the fences, modestly decorated
   with fruits or not decorated at all. German brewer Peter Luelsdorf brought
   the first Christmas tree of the current tradition to Slovenia in 1845. He
   set it up in his small brewery inn in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital.
   German officials, craftsmen and merchants quickly spread the tradition
   among the bourgeois population. The trees were typically decorated with
   walnuts, golden apples, carobs, and candles. At first the Catholic
   majority rejected this custom because they considered it a typical
   Protestant tradition. The first decorated Christmas Market was organized
   in Ljubljana already in 1859. However, this tradition was almost unknown
   to the rural population until World War I, after which everyone started
   decorating trees. Spruce trees have a centuries-long tradition in
   Slovenia. After World War II during Yugoslavia period, trees set in the
   public places (towns, squares, and markets) were politically replaced with
   fir trees, a symbol of socialism and Slavic mythology strongly associated
   with loyalty, courage, and dignity. However, spruce retained its
   popularity in Slovenian homes during those years and came back to public
   places after independence.^[45]^[46]^[47]^[48]

      Britain[edit]

   [IMG]An engraving published in the 1840s of Queen Victoria and Prince
   Albert created a craze for Christmas trees.^[49]

   Although the tradition of decorating churches and homes with evergreens at
   Christmas was long established,^[50] the custom of decorating an entire
   small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. The
   German-born Queen Charlotte introduced a Christmas tree at a party she
   gave for children in 1800.^[51] The custom did not at first spread much
   beyond the royal family.^[b] Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with
   it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. In her journal for
   Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote:^[53]

     After dinner [...] we then went into the drawing room near the dining
     room [...] There were two large round tables on which were placed two
     trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being
     placed round the trees [...]

   After Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the
   custom became even more widespread^[54] as wealthier middle-class families
   followed the fashion. In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes
   clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and
   gift-giving.^[55] An illustrated book, The Christmas Tree, describing
   their use and origins in detail, was on sale in December 1844.^[56] On
   2 January 1846 Elizabeth Fielding (née Fox Strangways) wrote from Lacock
   Abbey to William Henry Fox-Talbot: "Constance is extremely busy preparing
   the Bohemian Xmas Tree. It is made from Caroline's^[57] description of
   those she saw in Germany".^[58] In 1847 Prince Albert wrote: "I must now
   seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in
   the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the
   Christmas trees is not less than ours used to be".^[59] A boost to the
   trend was given in 1848^[60] when The Illustrated London News,^[61] in a
   report picked up by other papers,^[62] described the trees in Windsor
   Castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family,
   on its cover. In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was
   widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert
   alluding casually to them,^[63] as well as reporting the accidental death
   of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas
   tree.^[64] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a
   report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every
   family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still
   the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".^[65]

   Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made
   them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up
   specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums "who had never
   seen a Christmas tree" would enjoy one that year.^[66] Anti-German
   sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity^[67] but the
   effect was short-lived,^[68] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas
   trees had spread to all classes.^[69] In 1933 a restriction on the
   importation of foreign trees led to the "rapid growth of a new industry"
   as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially
   viable due to the size of demand.^[70] By 2013 the number of trees grown
   in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately eight million^[71]
   and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the
   Christmas season.

      Georgia[edit]

   [IMG]Decorated Chichilaki at the Orbeliani Palace

   Georgians have their own traditional Christmas tree called Chichilaki,
   made from dried up hazelnut or walnut branches that are shaped to form a
   small coniferous tree.^[72] These pale-colored ornaments differ in height
   from 20 cm (7.9 in) to 3 meters (9.8 ft). Chichilakis are most common in
   the Guria and Samegrelo regions of Georgia near the Black Sea, but they
   can also be found in some stores around the capital of Tbilisi.^[73]
   Georgians believe that Chichilaki resembles the famous beard of St. Basil
   the Great, because Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates St. Basil on 1
   January.

      The Bahamas[edit]

   The earliest reference of Christmas trees being used in The Bahamas dates
   to January 1864 and is associated with the Anglican Sunday Schools in
   Nassau, New Providence: "After prayers and a sermon from the Rev. R.
   Swann, the teachers and children of St. Agnes', accompanied by those of
   St. Mary's, marched to the Parsonage of Rev. J. H. Fisher, in front of
   which a large Christmas tree had been planted for their gratification. The
   delighted little ones formed a circle around it singing "Come follow me to
   the Christmas tree"."^[74] The gifts decorated the trees as ornaments and
   the children were given tickets with numbers that matched the gifts. This
   appears to be the typical way of decorating the trees in the 1860s
   Bahamas. In the Christmas of 1864, there was a Christmas tree put up in
   the Ladies Saloon in the Royal Victoria Hotel for the respectable children
   of the neighbourhood. The tree was ornamented with gifts for the children
   who formed a circle about it and sung the song "Oats and Beans". The gifts
   were later given to the children in the name of Santa Claus.^[75]

      North America[edit]

   [IMG]General and Mrs. Riedesel celebrating Christmas.

   The tradition was introduced to North America in the winter of 1781 by
   Hessian soldiers stationed in the Province of Québec (1763–1791) to
   garrison the colony against American attack. General Friedrich Adolf
   Riedesel and his wife, the Baroness von Riedesel, held a Christmas party
   for the officers at Sorel, Quebec, delighting their guests with a fir tree
   decorated with candles and fruits.^[76]

   The Christmas tree became very common in the United States of America in
   the early nineteenth century. Dating from late 1812 or early 1813, the
   watercolor sketchbooks of John Lewis Krimmel contain perhaps the earliest
   depictions of a Christmas tree in American art, representing a family
   celebrating Christmas Eve in the Moravian tradition.^[77] The first
   published image of a Christmas tree appeared in 1836 as the frontispiece
   to The Stranger's Gift by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the
   Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition
   of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, titled "New Year's Day", by Catherine
   Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her
   mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British royal family with their
   Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in The Illustrated
   London News December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas
   1850, in Godey's Lady's Book. Godey's copied it exactly, except for the
   removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's moustache, to remake the
   engraving into an American scene.^[78] The republished Godey's image
   became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen
   Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince
   Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, "the first
   influential American Christmas tree".^[79] Folk-culture historian Alfred
   Lewis Shoemaker states, "In all of America there was no more important
   medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than Godey's
   Lady's Book". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting
   up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.^[78]

   House Christmas tree in 1889.^[80]

   Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to
   that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims
   that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at
   the Noden-Reed House,^[81] while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is
   also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly
   erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of Lancaster,
   Pennsylvania, recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading
   Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.^[82]
   Other accounts credit Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston, for
   being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a
   Christmas tree.^[83] In 1847, August Imgard, a German immigrant living in
   Wooster, Ohio cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the
   Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his
   house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.^[84]
   German immigrant Charles Minnigerode accepted a position as a professor of
   humanities at the College of William @amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in
   1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of
   the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of
   decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St.
   George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted
   Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.^[85] An 1853 article
   on Christmas customs in Pennsylvania defines them as mostly "German in
   origin", including the Christmas tree, which is "planted in a flower pot
   filled with earth, and its branches are covered with presents, chiefly of
   confectionary, for the younger members of the family." The article
   distinguishes between customs in different states however, claiming that
   in New England generally "Christmas is not much celebrated", whereas in
   Pennsylvania and New York it is.^[86]

   When Edward H. Johnson was vice president of the Edison Electric Light
   Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known
   electrically illuminated Christmas tree at his home in New York City in
   1882. Johnson became the "Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights".^[87]

   The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune O Tannenbaum begin
   "O Christmas tree...", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the German
   word Tannenbaum (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for
   which is instead Weihnachtsbaum.

  1935 to present[edit]

   Under the state atheism of the Soviet Union, the Christmas tree, along
   with the entire celebration of the Christian holiday, was banned in that
   country after the October Revolution. However, the government then
   introduced a New-year spruce (Russian: Новогодняя ёлка,
   romanized: Novogodnyaya yolka) in 1935 for the New Year
   holiday.^[88]^[89]^[90] It became a fully secular icon of the New Year
   holiday: for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of
   Bethlehem Star, but as the Red star. Decorations, such as figurines of
   airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, cosmonauts, and characters of Russian
   fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the
   USSR, with the New Year holiday outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for
   a wide majority of Russian people.^[91]

   The Peanuts TV special A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) was influential on
   the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. Aluminum Christmas trees
   were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the
   TV special and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of
   Christmas. The term Charlie Brown Christmas tree, describing any
   poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV
   special, based on the appearance of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.^[92]

    Public Christmas trees[edit]

   [IMG]An early example of public Christmas tree for the children of
   unemployed parents in Prague (Czech Republic), 1931

   Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns,
   and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as
   the Macy's Great Tree in Atlanta (since 1948), the Rockefeller Center
   Christmas Tree in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at Victoria
   Square in Adelaide.

   The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real
   trees and be compliant with code. Licensed applicants of fire retardant
   solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for
   inspection.

   The United States' National Christmas Tree has been lit each year since
   1923 on the South Lawn of the White House, becoming part of what evolved
   into a major holiday event at the White House. President Jimmy Carter lit
   only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans
   being held hostage in Iran.^[93] The same was true in 1980, except the
   tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages
   had been in captivity.^[93]

   During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree
   in the world was put up every year on the property of the National
   Enquirer in Lantana, Florida. This tradition grew into one of the most
   spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but
   was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late
   1980s.^[94]

   In some cities, a charity event called the Festival of Trees is organized,
   in which multiple trees are decorated and displayed.

   The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end
   of hostilities. After the signing of the Armistice in 1918 the city of
   Manchester sent a tree, and £500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the
   children of the much-bombarded town of Lille in northern France.^[95] In
   some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in
   Trafalgar Square in London, where the City of Oslo, Norway presents a tree
   to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support
   of Norwegian resistance during the Second World War; in Boston, where the
   tree is a gift from the province of Nova Scotia, in thanks for rapid
   deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 ammunition ship explosion
   that leveled the city of Halifax; and in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the
   main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of Bergen, in
   thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen
   from Nazi occupation.^[96] Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to
   Washington, D.C. as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and
   as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the
   US during World War II.^[97]

Customs and traditions[edit]

  Setting up and taking down[edit]

   [IMG]Adding decorations to tree

   Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with
   specific dates; liturgically, this is done through the hanging of the
   greens ceremony.^[98] In many areas, it has become customary to set up
   one's Christmas tree on Advent Sunday, the first day of the Advent
   season.^[99]^[100] Traditionally, however, Christmas trees were not
   brought in and decorated until the evening of Christmas Eve (24 December),
   the end of the Advent season and the start of the twelve days of
   Christmastide.^[101] It is customary for Christians in many localities to
   remove their Christmas decorations on the last day of the twelve days of
   Christmastide that falls on 5 January—Epiphany Eve (Twelfth Night),^[102]
   although those in other Christian countries remove them on Candlemas, the
   conclusion of the extended Christmas-Epiphany season
   (Epiphanytide).^[103]^[104] According to the first tradition, those who
   fail to remember to remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve
   must leave them untouched until Candlemas, the second opportunity to
   remove them; failure to observe this custom is considered
   inauspicious.^[105]^[106]

   [IMG]Christmas ornaments at the Christmas market, Strasbourg

   Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood,
   or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first
   decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries
   in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made
   in Lauscha, Germany, and also garlands of glass beads and tin figures that
   could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations fueled the
   production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay
   molds.

   Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used as
   Christmas tree decorations. Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced
   later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments
   were a specialty of the glass factories in the Thuringian Forest,
   especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a
   large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another
   common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres
   coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further
   coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
   Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom,
   fairy lights) is commonly done. A tree-topper, sometimes an angel but more
   frequently a star, completes the decoration.

   In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping
   strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance
   of a snow-laden tree.

   In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,
   flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There
   were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the
   1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

Symbolism and interpretations[edit]

   The earliest legend of the origin of a fir tree becoming a Christian
   symbol dates back to 723 AD, involving Saint Boniface as he was
   evangelizing Germany.^[107] It is said that at a pagan gathering in
   Geismar where a group of people dancing under a decorated oak tree were
   about to sacrifice a baby in the name of Thor, Saint Boniface took an axe
   and called on the name of Jesus.^[107] In one swipe, he managed to take
   down the entire oak tree, to the crowd's astonishment.^[107] Behind the
   fallen tree was a baby fir tree.^[107] Boniface said, "let this tree be
   the symbol of the true God, its leaves are ever green and will not die."
   The tree's needles pointed to heaven and it was shaped triangularly to
   represent the Holy Trinity.^[107]

   When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the
   top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem.^[7]^[108] It became
   popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order
   to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of
   Jesus.^[8] Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of
   Christmas, the evergreen Christmas tree symbolizes eternal life; the
   candles or lights on the tree represent Christ as the light of the
   world.^[6]^[109]

   Wenzel Zajicek (1908)

   Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and
   50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000
   growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same
   year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas
   trees.^[110] By 2016 that had climbed to $2.04 billion for natural trees
   and a further $1.86 billion for artificial trees. In Europe, 75 million
   trees worth €2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) are harvested annually.^[111]

  Natural trees[edit]

   See also: Christmas tree cultivation

   The most commonly used species are fir (Abies), which have the benefit of
   not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good
   foliage color and scent; but species in other genera are also used.

   In northern Europe most commonly used are:

     * Norway spruce Picea abies (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
     * Silver fir Abies alba
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana
     * Noble fir Abies procera
     * Serbian spruce Picea omorika
     * Scots pine Pinus sylvestris
     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Swiss pine Pinus cembra

   In North America, Central America, South America and Australia most
   commonly used are:

     * Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii
     * Balsam fir Abies balsamea
     * Fraser Fir Abies fraseri
     * Grand fir Abies grandis
     * Guatemalan fir Abies guatemalensis
     * Noble fir Abies procera
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana
     * Red fir Abies magnifica
     * White fir Abies concolor
     * Pinyon pine Pinus edulis
     * Jeffrey pine Pinus jeffreyi
     * Scots pine Pinus sylvestris
     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Norfolk Island pine Araucaria heterophylla
     * Paraná pine Araucaria angustifolia (when young, resembles a Pine tree)

   Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional
   conifers are sometimes used, such as giant sequoia, Leyland cypress,
   Monterey cypress, and eastern juniper. Various types of spruce tree are
   also used for Christmas trees (including the blue spruce and, less
   commonly, the white spruce); but spruces begin to lose their needles
   rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making
   decorating uncomfortable. Virginia pine is still available on some tree
   farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is
   faded. The long-needled eastern white pine is also used there, though it
   is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to
   its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult
   with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes
   used, particularly in Oceania, and in Australia, some species of the
   genera Casuarina and Allocasuarina are also occasionally used as Christmas
   trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata Monterey
   pine. Adenanthos sericeus or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in
   southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. Hemlock species are
   generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor
   needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and
   ornaments.

   Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold
   live with roots and soil, often from a plant nursery, to be stored at
   nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often
   decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and
   sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly,
   the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment
   of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's
   health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree
   out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put
   back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a
   large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the
   survival rate of these trees is low.^[112] However, when done properly,
   replanting provides higher survival rates.^[113]

   European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared
   trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often
   wild-harvested on public lands)^[114] there is a preference for
   close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang
   decorations.

   In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but
   now almost all are commercially grown on tree farms. Almost all Christmas
   trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they
   are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According
   to the United States Department of Agriculture's agriculture census for
   2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree
   market in America, 5,717.09 square kilometres (1,412,724 acres) were
   planted in Christmas trees.^[115]

   The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a 2-metre (7 ft) tree
   takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between eight
   and twelve years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from
   older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold
   to Christmas tree farms at an age of three to four years. The remaining
   development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as
   well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree
   farmer.^[116]

  Artificial trees[edit]

   Main article: Artificial Christmas tree
   [IMG]An artificial Christmas tree

   The first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the
   19th century,^[117]^[118]^[self-published source?] though earlier examples
   exist.^[119] These "trees" were made using goose feathers that were dyed
   green,^[117] as one response by Germans to continued deforestation.^[118]
   Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 5-centimeter
   (2 in) tree to a large 2.5-meter (98 in) tree sold in department stores
   during the 1920s.^[120] Often, the tree branches were tipped with
   artificial red berries which acted as candle holders.^[121]

   Over the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved
   and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created
   the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.^[122]
   Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree,^[118]
   first manufactured in Chicago in 1958,^[123] and later in Manitowoc,
   Wisconsin, where the majority of the trees were produced.^[124] Most
   modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used
   packaging materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC).^[118] Approximately
   10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin;
   despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or
   biodegradable.^[125]

   Other trends developed also in the early 2000s. Optical fiber Christmas
   trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas
   tree.^[126] One Dallas-based company offers "holographic mylar" trees in
   many hues.^[119] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as
   cardboard,^[127] glass,^[128] ceramic or other materials can be found in
   use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became
   popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing
   gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in
   retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.^[129]

   Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th
   century.^[118] Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are
   more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their
   natural alternative.^[118] They are also considered much safer,^[130] as
   natural trees can be a significant fire hazard. Between 2001 and 2007,
   artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to
   17.4 million.^[131] Currently, it is estimated that around 58% of
   Christmas trees used in the United States are artificial, while numbers in
   the United Kingdom are indicated to be around 66%.^[132]

Environmental issues[edit]

   The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing.
   Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more
   environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.^[131] However,
   trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, claim that
   the PVC used in Christmas trees is chemically and mechanically stable and
   does not affect human health and has excellent recyclable
   properties.^[133] Live trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted
   in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for
   wildlife.^[134] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock
   farmers who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are
   excellent fodder.^[135] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops
   can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of
   pesticides.^[136] Concerns have been raised by arborists about people
   cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana for
   Christmas trees.^[137]

   Real or cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and
   used as mulch, wildlife habitat, or used to prevent
   erosion.^[138]^[139]^[140] Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no
   more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb
   while growing.^[141] However, emissions can occur from farming activities
   and transportation. An independent life-cycle assessment study, conducted
   by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural
   tree will generate 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) of greenhouse gases every year (based
   on purchasing 5 km (3.1 mi) from home) whereas the artificial tree will
   produce 48.3 kg (106 lb) over its lifetime.^[142] Some people use living
   Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life
   cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented
   from local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while
   purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local
   tree adoption or urban reforestation services.^[143] Smaller and younger
   trees may be replanted after each season, with the following year running
   up to the next Christmas allowing the tree to carry out further growth.

   The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of
   concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study
   found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from
   lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major
   health risks to young children exist.^[144] A 2008 United States
   Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial
   Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.^[145] The report determined that
   of the fifty million artificial trees in the United States approximately
   twenty million were nine or more years old, the point where dangerous lead
   contamination levels are reached.^[145] A professional study on the
   life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed
   that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least twenty years to
   leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas
   tree.^[142]

Religious issues[edit]

   Under the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union,
   after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other
   religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet
   anti-religious campaign.^[146]^[147]^[88] The League of Militant Atheists
   encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among
   them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays,
   including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be
   the 31st of each month as a replacement.^[148] With the Christmas tree
   being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation,
   people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's
   trees.^[88]^[149] In 1935, the tree was brought back as New Year tree and
   became a secular, not a religious holiday.

   Pope John Paul II introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in
   1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the
   centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican Christmas Tree has become
   an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,^[150] and in 2005
   Pope Benedict XVI spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations
   in Catholic homes.^[151] In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree
   a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of
   life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and
   it reminds Christians of the "tree of life",^[152] an image of Christ, the
   supreme gift of God to humanity.^[153] In the previous year he said:
   "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds
   us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the
   desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand
   down in time the true meaning of Christmas."^[154] The Catholic Church's
   official Book of Blessings has a service for the blessing of the Christmas
   tree in a home.^[155] The Episcopal Church in The Anglican Family Prayer
   Book, which has the imprimatur of The Rt. Rev. Catherine S. Roskam of the
   Anglican Communion, has long had a ritual titled Blessing of a Christmas
   Tree, as well as Blessing of a Crèche, for use in the church and the home;
   family services and public liturgies for the blessing of Christmas trees
   are common in other Christian denominations as well.^[156]^[157]

   Chrismon trees, which find their origin in the Lutheran Christian
   tradition though now used in many Christian denominations such as the
   Catholic Church and Methodist Church, are used to decorate churches during
   the liturgical season of Advent; during the period of Christmastide,
   Christian churches display the traditional Christmas tree in their
   sanctuaries.^[158]

   In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the
   Boston Common a "Holiday Tree" rather than a "Christmas Tree".^[159] The
   name change was reversed after the city was threatened with several
   lawsuits.^[160]

       took away so that the return to Eden-symbolized by the Christmas
       tree-is again possible for humanity.

       Christmas tree [...] originated in western Germany. The main prop of a
       popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with
       apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans
       set up a paradise tree in their homes on 24 December, the religious
       feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung round white discs on it
       (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of Christ's body in the
       Eucharist); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies
       of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of
       Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the
       Christmas pyramid, a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to
       hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a
       star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had
       merged, becoming the Christmas tree.

       locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree
       dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared
       Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a
       young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree
       was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the
       Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the

        December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic
        campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them
        with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve. At the
        beginning, stringent measures were put in place to see off any
        holdover of the old days: Christmas trees, introduced to Russia by
        Tsar Peter The Great in the 17th century, were banned in 1916 by the
        Holy Synod as too German. The Bolsheviks kept the tree ban in place.

        this putative religious revival. Antireligioznik obliged with so many
        articles that it devoted an entire section of its annual index for
        1928 to anti-religious training in the schools. More such material
        followed in 1929, and a flood of it the next year. It recommended
        what Lenin and others earlier had explicitly condemned—carnivals,
        farces, and games to intimidate and purge the youth of religious
        belief. It suggested that pupils campaign against customs associated
        with Christmas (including Christmas trees) and Easter. Some schools,
        the League approvingly reported, staged an anti-religious day on the
        31st of each month. Not teachers but the League's local set the
        programme for this special occasion.

        Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era. To
        keep the custom alive, people decorated New Year's trees instead.

        begun the tradition of using a Chrismon tree in the sanctuary as part
        of the Advent and Christmas celebration. It is important, especially
        for children, that the distinction between this tree and the family
        Christmas tree be clearly made. The Chrismon tree is decorated only
        with clear lights and Chrismons made from white and gold material.
        White, the color of Christmas, is the color of purity and perfection,
        while gold is the color for majesty and glory. The Chrismons are
        ancient symbols for Christ or some part of Christ's ministry: the
        crow, descending down, fish, Celtic cross, Jerusalem cross,
        shepherd's crook, chalice, shell, and others.

   The history of Christmas trees has many roots, ranging from the use of
   evergreens in ancient Egypt and Rome to the German traditions of candlelit
   trees that made its way to America in the 1800s. Discover the history of
   the Christmas tree, from the earliest winter solstice celebrations to
   Queen Victoria’s decorating habits and the annual lighting of the
   Rockefeller Center tree in New York City.

How Did Christmas Trees Start?

   Long before the advent of Christianity, plants and trees that remained
   green all year had a special meaning for people in the winter. Just as
   people today decorate their homes during the festive season with pine,
   spruce, and fir trees, many ancient peoples hung evergreen boughs over
   their doors and windows. In many countries it was believed that evergreens
   would keep away witches, ghosts, evil spirits, and illness.

   History of Christmas Trees

   In the Northern hemisphere, the shortest day and longest night of the year
   falls on December 21 or December 22 and is called the winter solstice.
   Many ancient people believed that the sun was a god and that winter came
   every year because the sun god had become sick and weak. They celebrated
   the solstice because it meant that at last the sun god would begin to get
   well. Evergreen boughs reminded them of all the green plants that would
   grow again when the sun god was strong and summer would return.

   The ancient Egyptians worshipped a god called Ra, who had the head of a
   hawk and wore the sun as a blazing disk in his crown. At the solstice,
   when Ra began to recover from his illness, the Egyptians filled their
   homes with green palms and papyrus reeds, which symbolized for them the
   triumph of life over death.

     Did you know? Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including
     Hawaii and Alaska.

   Early Romans marked the solstice with a feast called Saturnalia in honor
   of Saturn, the god of agriculture. The Romans knew that the solstice meant
   that soon, farms and orchards would be green and fruitful. To mark the
   occasion, they decorated their homes and temples with evergreen boughs.

   In Northern Europe the Druids, the priests of the ancient Celts, also
   decorated their temples with evergreen boughs as a symbol of everlasting
   life. The Vikings in Scandinavia honored the evergreen mistletoe for its
   role in the death of the Balder, a god of light.

Christmas Trees From Germany

   Germany is credited with starting the Christmas tree tradition—as we now
   know it—by the 16th century  when sources record devout Christians
   bringing decorated trees into their homes. Some built Christmas pyramids
   of wood and decorated them with evergreens and candles if wood was scarce.

   It is a widely held belief that Martin Luther, the 16th-century Protestant
   reformer, first added lighted candles to a tree. According to a common
   version of the story, walking home one winter evening, Luther was awed by
   the stars twinkling amidst evergreens. To recapture the scene for his
   family, he erected a tree in the main room and wired its branches with
   lighted candles.

Who Brought Christmas Trees to America?

   Most 19th-century Americans found Christmas trees an oddity. The first
   records of Christmas trees being cut for display comes from the 1820s in
   Pennsylvania’s German community, although trees may have been a tradition
   there even earlier. As early as 1747, Moravian Germans in Pennsylvania had
   a community tree in the form of a wooden pyramid decorated with candles.
   But, as late as the 1840s, Christmas trees were seen as pagan symbols and
   not accepted by most Americans.

   It is not surprising that, like many other festive Christmas customs, the
   tree was adopted so late in America. New England’s first Puritan leaders
   viewed Christmas celebrations as unholy. The pilgrims’s second governor,
   William Bradford, wrote that he tried hard to stamp out “pagan mockery” of
   the observance, penalizing any frivolity.

   In 1659, the General Court of Massachusetts enacted a law making any
   observance of December 25 a penal offense; people were fined for hanging
   decorations. That stern solemnity continued until the influx of German and
   Irish immigrants in the 19th century undermined the Puritan legacy.

   Queen Victoria's Christmas TreeQueen Victoria's Christmas TreeBettmann

   An illustration from a December 1848 edition of the Illustrated London
   News shows Queen Victoria and her family surrounding a Christmas tree.

   In 1846, the popular royals, Queen Victoria and her German Prince, Albert,
   were sketched in the Illustrated London News standing with their children
   around a Christmas tree. Unlike the previous royal family, Victoria was
   very popular with her subjects, and what was done at court immediately
   became fashionable—not only in Britain, but with fashion-conscious East
   Coast American Society. The Christmas tree had arrived.

   By the 1890s Christmas ornaments were arriving from Germany and Christmas
   tree popularity was on the rise around the U.S. It was noted that
   Europeans used small trees about four feet in height, while Americans
   liked their Christmas trees to extend from floor to ceiling.

   The early 20th century saw Americans decorating their trees mainly with
   homemade ornaments, while many German Americans continued to use apples,
   nuts and marzipan cookies. Stringed popcorn was added to trees' decoration
   after being dyed bright colors and interlaced with berries and nuts.
   Electricity brought about Christmas lights, making it possible for
   Christmas trees to glow for days on end. With this, Christmas trees began
   to appear in town squares across the country and having a Christmas tree
   in the home became an American tradition.

   The Invention of Christmas Lights

Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree

   The Rockefeller Center tree is located at Rockefeller Center, west of
   Fifth Avenue from 47th through 51st Streets in New York City.

   The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree dates back to the Depression era,
   with the first tree placed in 1931. It was a small unadorned tree set up
   by construction workers at the center of the construction site. Two years
   later, another tree was placed there, this time with lights.

   These days, the giant Rockefeller Center tree is laden with over 50,000
   Christmas lights. The tallest tree displayed at Rockefeller Center arrived
   in 1999. It was a Norway Spruce that measured 100 feet tall and hailed
   from Killingworth, Connecticut.

Christmas Trees Around the World

   Christmas Trees in Canada
   German settlers began migrating to Canada from the United States in the
   1700s. They brought Canada’s first Christmas trees and, in later
   generations, gingerbread houses and Advent calendars. When Queen
   Victoria’s German husband, Prince Albert, put up a Christmas tree at
   Windsor Castle in 1848, Christmas trees became a widely popular tradition
   throughout England, the United States and Canada.

   Christmas Trees in Mexico
   In most Mexican homes the principal holiday adornment is el Nacimiento
   (Nativity scene). However, a decorated Christmas tree may be incorporated
   in the Nacimiento or set up elsewhere in the home. As purchase of a
   natural pine represents a luxury commodity to most Mexican families, the
   typical arbolito (little tree) is often an artificial one, a bare branch
   cut from a copal tree (Bursera microphylla) or some type of shrub
   collected from the countryside.

   Christmas Trees in Great Britain
   The Norway spruce is the traditional species used to decorate homes in
   Britain. The Norway spruce was a native species in the British Isles
   before the last Ice Age, and was reintroduced here before the 1500s.

   Christmas Trees in Greenland
   Since icy Greenland lacks large native forests, most Christmas trees are
   imported. They are decorated with candles and bright ornaments.

   Christmas Trees in Guatemala
   The Christmas tree has joined the Nacimiento as a popular ornament because
   of the large German population in Guatemala.

   Christmas Trees in Brazil
   Although Christmas falls during the summer in most of Brazil, sometimes
   pine trees are decorated with little pieces of cotton that represent
   falling snow.

   Christmas Trees in Ireland
   Christmas trees are bought anytime in December and decorated with colored
   lights, tinsel, and baubles. Some people favor the angel on top of the
   tree, others the star. The house is decorated with garlands, candles,
   holly, and ivy. Wreaths and mistletoe are hung on the door.

   Christmas Trees in Sweden
   Most people buy Christmas trees well before Christmas Eve, but it’s not
   common to take the tree inside and decorate it until just a few days
   before. Evergreen trees are decorated with stars, sunbursts and snowflakes
   made from straw. Other decorations include colorful wooden animals and
   straw centerpieces.

   Christmas Trees in Norway
   Norwegians often take a trip to the woods to select a Christmas tree, a
   trip that their grandfathers probably did not make. The Christmas tree was
   not introduced into Norway from Germany until the latter half of the 19th
   century; to the country districts it came even later. Many families
   decorate their trees on ‘Little Christmas Eve’—December 23. A Norwegian
   ritual known as “circling the Christmas tree” follows, where everyone
   joins hands to form a ring around the tree and then walks around it
   singing carols.

   Christmas Trees in Ukraine
   Celebrated on December 25th by Catholics and on January 7th by Orthodox
   Christians, Christmas is the most popular holiday in the Ukraine. During
   the Christmas season, which also includes New Year’s Day, people decorate
   fir trees and have parties.

   Christmas Trees in Spain
   A popular Christmas custom in Catalonia is the Caga Tió, a decorated log
   that children “feed” scraps of food during the days before Christmas. On
   Christmas, the log is covered with a blanket and the children hit it with
   a stick. Then the blanket is removed to reveal the treats like toffee and
   hazelnuts that Caga Tió has “defecated.

   Christmas Trees in Italy
   In one Italian tradition, the presepio (manger or crib) represents in
   miniature the Holy Family in the stable and is the center of Christmas for
   families. Guests kneel before it and musicians sing before it. The
   presepio figures are usually hand-carved and very detailed in features and
   dress. The scene is often set out in the shape of a triangle. It provides
   the base of a pyramid-like structure called the ceppo. This is a wooden
   frame arranged to make a pyramid several feet high. Several tiers of thin
   shelves are supported by this frame. It is entirely decorated with colored
   paper, gilt pine cones, and miniature colored pennants. Small candles are
   fastened to the tapering sides. A star or small doll is hung at the apex
   of the triangular sides. The shelves above the manger scene have small
   gifts of fruit, candy, and presents. The ceppo is likely related to older
   ‘tree of light’ traditions linked to Christmas trees in other countries.
   Some houses even have a ceppo for each child in the family.

   Christmas Trees in Germany
   Many Christmas traditions practiced around the world today started in
   Germany.

   As mentioned above, some Lutheran traditions credit Martin Luther with
   placing the first lighted candles on a Christmas tree.

   Another legend says that in the early 16th century, people in Germany
   combined two customs that had been practiced in different countries around
   the globe. The Paradise tree (a fir tree decorated with apples)
   represented the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. The Christmas
   Light, a small, pyramid-like frame, usually decorated with glass balls,
   tinsel and a candle on top, was a symbol of the birth of Christ as the
   Light of the World. Changing the tree’s apples to tinsel balls and cookies
   and combining this new tree with the light placed on top, the Germans
   created the tree that many of us know today.

   The modern Tannenbaum (Christmas trees) is traditionally decorated in
   secret with lights, tinsel and ornaments by parents and then lit and
   revealed on Christmas Eve with cookies, nuts and gifts under its branches.

   Christmas Trees in South Africa
   Christmas is a summer holiday in South Africa. Although Christmas trees
   are not common, windows are often draped with sparkling cotton wool and
   tinsel.

   Christmas Trees in Saudi Arabia
   Christian Americans, Europeans, Indians, Filipinos, and others living in
   Saudia Arabia have to celebrate Christmas privately in their homes.
   Christmas lights are generally not tolerated. Most families place their
   Christmas trees somewhere inconspicuous.

   Christmas Trees in Philippines
   Fresh pine trees are too expensive for many Filipinos, so handmade trees
   in an array of colors and sizes are often used. Star lanterns, or parol,
   appear everywhere in December. They are made from bamboo sticks, covered
   with brightly colored rice paper or cellophane, and usually feature a
   tassel on each point. There is usually one in every window, each
   representing the Star of Bethlehem.

   Christmas Trees in China
   More than 80 percent of the world’s artificial Christmas trees are made in
   China, but a much smaller portion of Chinese people celebrate Christmas as
   a religious holiday. Those who do often put up artificial trees—“trees of
   light” decorated with paper chains and lanterns.

   Christmas Trees in Japan
   For most of the Japanese who celebrate Christmas, it’s purely a secular
   holiday devoted to the love of their children. Christmas trees are
   decorated with small toys, dolls, paper ornaments, gold paper fans and
   lanterns, and wind chimes. Miniature candles are also put among the tree
   branches. One of the most popular ornaments is the origami crane. Japanese
   children have exchanged thousands of folded paper “birds of peace” with
   young people all over the world as a pledge that war must not happen
   again.

Christmas Tree Trivia and Facts

   Christmas trees have been sold commercially in the United States since
   about 1850.

   In 1979, the National Christmas Tree was not lighted except for the top
   ornament. This was done in honor of the American hostages in Iran.

   Between 1887-1933 a fishing schooner called the Christmas Ship would tie
   up at the Clark Street bridge and sell spruce and pine trees from Michigan
   to Chicagoans.

   The much-disputed title for the tallest living Christmas tree likely goes
   to an allegedly 160-foot Sitka Spruce in Ferndale, California.

   Franklin Pierce, the 14th president, is often credited with bringing the
   Christmas tree tradition to the White House in the early 1850s.

   In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge started the National Christmas Tree
   Lighting Ceremony now held every year on the White House lawn.

   Since 1966, the National Christmas Tree Association has given a Christmas
   tree to the President and first family.

   Most Christmas trees are cut weeks before they get to a retail outlet.

   In 1912, what were likely the first major community Christmas trees in the
   United States were erected in Boston, New York City and Hartford, Conn.

   Christmas trees generally take six to eight years to mature.

   Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including Hawaii and Alaska.

   Ninety-eight percent of all natural Christmas trees are grown on farms.

   More than 1,000,000 acres of land have been planted with Christmas trees.

   On average, as many as 1,500 Christmas trees are planted per acre.

   You should never burn your Christmas tree in the fireplace. It can
   contribute to creosote buildup.

   Other types of trees such as cherry and hawthorns were used as Christmas
   trees in the past.

   Thomas Edison’s assistants came up with the idea of electric lights for
   Christmas trees.

   In 1963, the National Christmas Tree was not lit until December 22nd
   because of a national 30-day period of mourning following the
   assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

   Teddy Roosevelt banned the Christmas tree from the White House, possibly
   for environmental reasons—but his young son snuck a tree into the house
   anyway.

   In the first week, a tree in your home will consume as much as three
   quarts of water per day.

   Tinsel used to be made with lead foil, but in the early 1970s the U.S.
   Food and Drug Administration convinced manufacturers to switch to plastic
   tinsel.

   The best-selling Christmas trees include the Scotch Pine, Douglas Fir,
   Fraser Fir, Balsam Fir and Blue Spruce.

HISTORY Vault: The Christmas Truce

   By December 1914, all thoughts of a quick World War I victory had faded.
   But on Christmas Eve, an astonishing event took place: Up and down the
   Western Front, Allied and German soldiers met peacefully in No Man's Land.

   Eucalyptus are one of the state’s most controversial trees. A Monterey Bay
                reserve may be a model for how to replace them.

The Elkhorn Slough Reserve is pioneering methods to restore native habitats

   Fresh tree stumps the size of dining tables line the road at the Elkhorn
   Slough Reserve, the remains of hulking eucalyptus trees that blanketed the
   ground in a thick layer of aromatic wood chips. Nothing grows in the
   wreckage, but about 40 yards away, a grove of young oak trees flourishes.

   Mary Paul, a stewardship associate at the reserve just east of Moss
   Landing at the heart of the Monterey Bay, revels in the contrast. Where
   the oaks now stand, staff removed a 13-acre grove of eucalyptus in the
   1990s and planted well over 10,000 acorns. In a few decades, the roadside
   site where eucalyptus trees were cut down this summer should match the
   restored oak savanna beside it.

   Paul hopes the restoration efforts at Elkhorn Slough will help quell
   public opposition to the removal of the eucalyptus — an invasive tree
   native to Australia that has become a California icon, and a shelter for
   migrating birds and Monarch butterflies, but must be removed because they
   crowd out native species, increase fire risk and guzzle the state’s scarce
   water.

   “It’s not just about clear-cutting all the eucalyptus within the
   watershed, or even within the reserve — it’s about creating healthy
   ecosystems and healthy balance,” Paul said. “We are trying to balance
   everything.”

   Returning eucalyptus-choked landscapes to their original glory is a long
   and arduous process. It involves coaxing the barren earth back to life and
   dealing with thousands of tons of highly flammable wood.

   Also called blue gum, eucalyptus is a fast-growing tree native to
   Tasmania, an island state south of the Australian mainland. During the
   California Gold Rush of the 1800s, they were planted for windbreaks, fuel
   and timber. But when logs came out of the mill, the lumber was of poor
   quality, and many plantations were abandoned. Thousands of acres are left
   standing today.

   At the Elkhorn Slough Reserve — home to a vast array of birds, marine
   mammals, amphibians and fish — thirsty eucalyptus trees leave the wetlands
   more vulnerable to drought and problems with water quality. To save this
   vital habitat, the reserve has made removing the trees a priority in areas
   where they are doing harm.

   But some community members have objected. In 2015, when the Elkhorn Slough
   Reserve proposed chopping down more than 1,200 trees across 50 acres by
   2025, staff received angry comments from locals, many concerned that
   important Monarch butterfly and bird habitat would disappear.

   Similar objections have erupted around felling other eucalyptus groves,
   such as the removal of 31 trees on private land around Rodeo Creek in
   Santa Cruz, which was just completed. “I had no idea how much wildlife
   lived in the eucalyptus before I moved here,” said Santa Cruz resident
   Rebecca Wyatt, who opposed the move. “In the evening time before the sun
   goes down, it’s just magical — hundreds and hundreds of birds are diving
   in and out … but now, they’re homeless. It’s just heartbreaking.”

   Monarch butterflies migrating from the Rocky Mountains to California’s
   Central Coast every winter huddle in some eucalyptus groves for warmth.
   The reserve is also an important spot along the Pacific Flyway, a major
   bird migration route, where seabirds nest in eucalyptus groves and fatten
   up in the rich estuary habitat.

   “One of the ways that we addressed that concern was pointing out that we
   were going to leave active bird nesting and butterfly nesting habitat
   intact, in a part of the reserve where there’s a huge grove of eucalyptus
   trees,” Paul said, pointing to a dense stand in the distance, beside two
   stacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant. “We’re not going to remove that at
   all, ever.”

   At another restoration site where eucalyptus trees were downed in August
   2022, native plants sprout from holes in a foot-thick layer of eucalyptus
   wood chips. The scene challenges a common belief that eucalyptus is
   “allelopathic,” meaning it releases chemicals in the soil that make it
   difficult for other plants to grow. Scientists disagree on this, however,
   and no previous studies have looked at planting in eucalyptus mulch as
   Paul is doing on the reserve’s restoration sites.

   The thick layer of mulch blocks sunlight from reaching seeds of invasive
   weeds such as Italian thistle, poison hemlock and Cape ivy that would
   otherwise quickly take over.

   “Our personal experience on the reserve was that we did not see any
   effects of allelopathy on our native plants when we planted them with wood
   chips,” Paul said.

   To encourage only native plants to grow, Paul and her team dug pits into
   the eucalyptus mulch down to the soil layer and planted species grown in
   the reserve’s native nursery, including California goldenrod and creeping
   wild rye. The reserve plans to create a pond at the end of the catchment
   for endangered California red-legged frogs and California tiger
   salamanders, which rely on bodies of freshwater in the winter to breed.

   “There was a historic stream that was present on this site that hadn’t
   really been seen very much when the eucalyptus were here,” Paul said.
   After the trees were felled, the stream resurfaced during last winter’s
   storms.

   Even after creating wood chip mulch to help with restoration projects,
   thousands of tons of wood can be left behind after a eucalyptus grove is
   cut down. So Paul and her team have experimented with turning it into
   charcoal.

   After felling their first grove in 2018, Elkhorn Slough Reserve staff and
   volunteers chopped up the trunks and larger branches and built dozens of
   4-foot diameter burn piles, lighting them from the top-down to slowly
   “pyrolize” the wood into charcoal or “biochar”  — rather than burning it
   from the bottom-up into ash, which would release much more carbon into the
   air. They then buried some of the charcoal as part of an effort to restore
   a salt marsh, locking up the carbon the eucalyptus trees had sucked from
   the air over their lifetime.

   But this manual approach to making charcoal proved impractical. “That was
   such a labor-intensive process that we ended up stopping because we just
   didn’t have the capacity to do it anymore,” Paul said.

   The Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with the reserve,
   decided to automate the process after chopping down 8,000 tons of
   eucalyptus on 7 acres in 2021. Land acquisitions coordinator Kevin
   Contreras persuaded a contractor, Ventana Forestry, to buy a $500,000
   carbonator — a huge kiln the size of a shipping container that heats wood
   at temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Fahrenheit. After the carbonator
   went to work, the foundation was left with 215 tons of charcoal and a tiny
   pile of ash.

   This winter, Contreras is partnering with Arun Jani, assistant professor
   of crop management at CSU Monterey Bay, and Javier Zamora, an organic
   farmer at Triple M Ranch, to study whether charcoal mixed with compost
   will enhance crop growth. Since charcoal is porous and absorbent, it’s
   expected to hold moisture and create habitat for microbes in the soil that
   help plants grow.

   If the experiment is a success, selling charcoal to farmers could provide
   a stream of income to help offset the cost of eucalyptus removal. The
   Elkhorn Slough Foundation wants to remove another 100 acres of eucalyptus
   on its land, an undertaking Contreras says will cost upwards of $2
   million.

   “If we’re going to tackle eucalyptus on a statewide basis, we need to be
   able to drive the cost of these projects down,” he said.

   Some important tree species native to the northwestern states in the U.S.
   are no longer growing well because of climate change.

   As conditions change in states such as Washington, Oregon and California,
   trees such as the Douglas fir, Western red cedar, giant sequoia and
   redwood may need to move -- with the help of humans.

   Some of the trees do not do well when temperatures rise. Others suffer
   during times of drought. The goal is to move the trees to areas where the
   climate might more suitable.

   Forest scientists are generally in favor of moving the trees so they do
   not die out. However, not all of the scientists agree on the best way to
   do it.

   There are three ways to move trees: assisted population migration,
   assisted species migration and range expansion.

   Canyon Nation Park Fire Service, looks for an opening in the burned-out
   sequoias from the Redwood Mountain Grove. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian, File)

   sequoias from the Redwood Mountain Grove. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian, File)

   Assisted population migration involves scientists moving a tree’s seeds
   within its current growing range. Assisted species migration involves
   scientists moving a species far from its existing area. In this case, that
   would include moving redwoods and sequoias from California to Washington.

   The third way, range expansion, moves trees just outside their current
   growing range. Each way has different results for the trees and other
   animals and insects that depend on the trees.

   Michael Case is a forest ecologist at the Nature Conservancy in Virginia.
   He said “there is a huge difference” among the different migration
   methods.

   He said the risk of failure increases “whenever you plant something in an
   area where it is not locally found.” He said the risk is not only to the
   trees. There is also the risk of causing problems in the ecosystem.

   Case is working on an assisted population migration program with Douglas
   fir and Western hemlock trees. He is testing whether the trees, originally
   from drier parts of the northwest, can do well in western Washington where
   there is a drought. His organization believes that assisted population
   migration has fewer risks.

   The U.S. Forest Service also takes part in assisted population migration
   programs. Dr. David Lytle is the agency’s deputy chief for research and
   development. He said the agency is “very very cautious” about moving
   plants outside of their “historic range.”

   Douglas Tallamy is a professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the
   University of Delaware. He said one worry about species migration is that
   local caterpillars might not eat the leaves of trees that are new to the
   area. The caterpillars serve as food for birds and other animals, so they
   must have a good food source.

   Although the concerns are documented, the city of Portland, Oregon, is
   working on a species migration project for 11 tree species. The project
   includes three oak trees: California black oak, canyon live oak and
   interior live oak. Tallamy said oak trees are among the most important in
   North America. “When you move them out of range,” he said, “the things
   that are adapted to eating them no longer have access to them.”

   The city responded to questions from the Associated Press, and said it is
   using guidelines “from universities, state and federal sources” and more,
   in its project.

   Another group working on species migration projects in the northwest is
   called PropagationNation. To propagate means to produce a new plant
   through the use of seeds or parts of another plant.

   That organization is planting non-local trees around the Seattle,
   Washington area in hopes that they will start growing in places where
   Western red cedar, Western hemlock and big leaf maple are having trouble.

   David Milarch is the leader of a group in Michigan that supports keeping
   old trees alive. It is called Archangel Ancient Tree Archive. Milarch said
   the hope is to permit redwoods and sequoias to grow in areas to the north.
   The hope is not to replace native trees.

   He said his group hopes the trees “will still be here in 100 to 200 years
   and not join the list of trees that are going extinct.”

   The organizations that are not practicing widely accepted methods for
   moving species feel like the risks are worth it.

   But Robert Slesak is not sure about either practice. He oversees
   population migration sites run by the U.S. Forest Service in California,
   Oregon and Washington.

   He said he has concerns about assisted species migrations and assisted
   population migrations that lack experimental rigor. Rigor describes an
   activity that has been tested with high standards.

   He said all of the ideas about how to move trees should follow experiments
   that have already produced strong results.

   “Everyone knows we need to do some kind of action related to climate, but
   there’s a real risk of making it worse.”

   (angiosperm) tree [IMG]European larch (Larix decidua), a coniferous tree
   which is also deciduous

   In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
   usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of
   a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
   plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
   wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
   also trees.

   Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety
   of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
   way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of
   tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are
   gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching
   several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million
   years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees
   in the world.

   A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground
   by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and
   vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
   For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a
   protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out
   widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients
   from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and
   shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
   convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the
   tree's growth and development.

   Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but
   some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
   Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce
   spores instead.

   Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the
   climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large
   quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat
   for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the
   most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter,
   timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food
   as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests are
   shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available
   for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have
   always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play
   a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Definition

   [IMG]Diagram of secondary growth in a eudicot or coniferous tree showing
   idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added
   in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots.

   Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally
   recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in
   common language.^[1]^[2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with
   the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the
   photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.^[3]
   Trees are also typically defined by height,^[4] with smaller plants from
   0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,^[5] so the minimum
   height of a tree is only loosely defined.^[4] Large herbaceous plants such
   as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.^[2]^[6]

   A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk
   formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by
   growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the
   growing tip.^[4]^[7] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as
   palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their
   height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered
   trees under a slightly looser definition;^[8] while the Joshua tree,
   bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood
   with growth rings,^[9]^[10] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying
   cells formed by primary growth.^[11] Tree species in the genus Dracaena,
   despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem
   in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in
   dicotyledonous trees.^[12]

   Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for
   instance, as those plants which yield lumber.^[13]

Overview

   "Saplings" redirects here. For the novel, see Saplings (novel). For the
   film, see The Saplings. For the episode, see Saplings (Weeds).

   The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different
   groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for
   sunlight.^[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,^[15] some reaching
   several thousand years old.^[16] Several trees are among the oldest
   organisms now living.^[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker
   stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and
   durability, allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to
   spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar
   growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;^[5]
   but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,^[18]
   made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under
   harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
   The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in
   response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example
   of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the
   number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living
   plant species.^[19]^[20] The greatest number of these grow in tropical
   regions; many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by
   botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.^[21]

   [IMG]Tall herbaceous monocotyledonous plants such as banana lack secondary
   growth, but are trees under the broadest definition.

   The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods. Of the rest,
   many are gymnosperms or softwood trees;^[22] these include conifers,
   cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales, which produce seeds which are not
   enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many
   have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.^[23] Most angiosperm trees
   are eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain
   two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old
   lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots;
   these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,^[24] while trees
   such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

   Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this
   supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows
   water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant,
   and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees,
   as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the
   xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the
   leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.^[25] The
   three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are
   integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living
   cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium
   allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
   Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also
   have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives
   rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and
   reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork
   are forms of secondary growth.^[26]

   Trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green
   throughout the year,^[27] or deciduous, shedding their leaves at the end
   of the growing season and then having a dormant period without
   foliage.^[28] Most conifers are evergreens, but larches (Larix and
   Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some
   species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small
   leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.^[5] The crown is
   the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,^[29] while
   the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is
   known as the canopy.^[30] A sapling is a young tree.^[31]

   Many tall palms are herbaceous^[32] monocots, which do not undergo
   secondary growth and never produce wood.^[9]^[10] In many tall palms, the
   terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have
   unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree
   ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20
   metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which
   grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.^[33]

Distribution

   Further information: Forest
   [IMG]The Daintree Rainforest

   The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04
   trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics,
   0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the
   coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than
   previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over
   400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least
   because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate
   suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5
   billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human
   agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by
   46%.^[34]^[35]^[36]^[37] There are approximately 64,100 known tree species
   in the world. With 43% of all tree species, South America has the highest
   biodiversity, followed by Eurasia (22%), Africa (16%), North America
   (15%), and Oceania (11%).^[38]

   In suitable environments, such as the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland,
   or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand,
   forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end of
   a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by
   taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a
   forest canopy.^[39]^[40]

   [IMG]Conifers in the Swabian alps

   In cool temperate regions, conifers often predominate; a widely
   distributed climax community in the far north of the northern hemisphere
   is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal
   forest).^[41]^[42] Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of
   the world's forest cover.^[43] The long cold winter of the far north is
   unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short
   summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is
   very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on
   the forest floor, although fungi may abound.^[44] Similar woodland is
   found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be
   lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.^[45]

   Where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate
   regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like
   oak, beech, birch and maple is found.^[46] Temperate forest is also found
   in the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia
   temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia
   woodland.^[47]

   In tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier
   part of the year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest,
   different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them
   being deciduous.^[48] In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and
   insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed,
   and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and
   scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.^[49]

Parts and function

  Roots

   [IMG]A young red pine (Pinus resinosa) with spread of roots visible, as a
   result of soil erosion
   Main article: Root

   The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and
   nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for
   reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.
   The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge
   from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a
   taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots
   branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper
   layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and
   the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are
   single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil
   particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in
   solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such
   as mangroves and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in
   permanently waterlogged soil.^[50]

   In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are
   known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree
   roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish
   in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and
   associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus
   from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of
   photosynthesis from the tree.^[51] The hyphae of the fungus can link
   different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and
   signals from one place to another.^[52] The fungus promotes growth of the
   roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can
   also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate
   heavy metals within its tissues.^[53] Fossil evidence shows that roots
   have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic,
   four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised
   dry land.^[54]

   [IMG]Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)

   Some trees such as Alder (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship
   with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from
   the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules
   on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree
   to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to
   thrive.^[55] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule
   formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.^[56]

   It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their
   root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the
   inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal
   tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by
   injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking
   for its presence in neighbouring trees.^[57]

   The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree
   species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial
   roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of
   the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical
   stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that
   loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the
   mud.^[58] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.^[59] Many
   large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the
   trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide
   stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in
   tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the
   surface.^[60]

   Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in
   order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of
   excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are
   present, among others, in black mangrove and pond cypress.^[58]

  Trunk

   [IMG]Northern beech (Fagus sylvatica) trunk in autumn
   Main article: Trunk (botany)

   The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground,
   enabling the tree to overtop other plants and outcompete them for
   light.^[61] It also transports water and nutrients from the roots to the
   aerial parts of the tree, and distributes the food produced by the leaves
   to all other parts, including the roots.^[62]

   In the case of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the
   trunk is the bark, mostly composed of dead cells of phellem (cork).^[63]
   It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It
   protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire.
   It is perforated by a large number of fine breathing pores called
   lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by
   a living layer of cells called the cork cambium or phellogen.^[63] The
   London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large
   flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off
   in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in
   circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In
   some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin
   which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is
   a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis)
   contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.^[62] Large
   tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales,
   Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos
   have different structures and outer coverings.^[64]

   [IMG]A section of yew (Taxus baccata) showing 27 annual growth rings, pale
   sapwood and dark heartwood

   Although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked
   by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and
   the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery
   of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the
   tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried
   from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the
   growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards
   and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of
   nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were
   killed by this disease.^[65]

   The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in
   the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to
   other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some
   of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by
   parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for
   strengthening the tissue.^[66] Inside the phloem is a layer of
   undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer.
   The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside
   and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.^[67]

   The newly created xylem is the sapwood. It is composed of water-conducting
   cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in
   colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts
   of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively
   converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The
   conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species. Heartwood
   is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core
   of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the
   xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin,
   a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a
   horizontal core will show concentric circles of lighter or darker wood –
   tree rings.^[68] These rings are the annual growth rings^[69]^[70] There
   may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are
   vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the
   wood.^[68] Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright
   for many years.^[71]

  Buds and growth

   Main article: Bud
   [IMG]Dormant Magnolia bud

   Trees do not usually grow continuously throughout the year but mostly have
   spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This pattern of
   growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when
   conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive
   period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active
   growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the
   tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and
   enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is
   a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand
   when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the
   leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the
   eucalyptus, have "naked buds" with no protective scales and some conifers,
   such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets
   of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.^[72]

   When growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and
   the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts
   again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the
   process. These leave behind scars on the surface of the twig. The whole
   year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is
   unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms)
   have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.^[72] In some
   tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas
   growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss
   of early foliage to insect predators.^[73]

   Primary growth is the elongation of the stems and roots. Secondary growth
   consists of a progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as
   the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium
   layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.^[74]
   Eventually the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no
   taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.^[75]

  Leaves

   Main article: Leaf

   Leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on
   the tree in such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without
   shading each other.^[76] They are an important investment by the tree and
   may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to
   discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes
   and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and
   predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or
   entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The
   needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to
   those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments
   where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water
   availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher
   altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such
   as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling
   them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions
   deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get
   shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make
   new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the
   blades become apparent.^[76] Synthesis in the leaf of a plant hormone
   called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the
   petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats
   to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their
   leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be
   replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other
   tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves
   annually, such as at the start of the dry season.^[77] Many deciduous
   trees flower before the new leaves emerge.^[78] A few trees do not have
   true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance
   such as Phylloclades – modified stem structures^[79] – as seen in the
   genus Phyllocladus.^[80]

  Reproduction

   Further information: Plant reproduction, Pollination, and Seed dispersal

   Trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects. Many
   angiosperm trees are insect pollinated. Wind pollination may take
   advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground.^[81] Trees use a
   variety of methods of seed dispersal. Some rely on wind, with winged or
   plumed seeds. Others rely on animals, for example with edible fruits.
   Others again eject their seeds (ballistic dispersal), or use gravity so
   that seeds fall and sometimes roll.^[82]

  Seeds

   Main article: Seed

   Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary
   greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but
   the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest
   tree seeds.^[83] The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the
   many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their
   offspring.

   [IMG]Wind dispersed seed of elm (Ulmus), ash (Fraxinus) and maple (Acer)

   For a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light. If seeds
   only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated
   saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from
   flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to
   aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with
   blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The
   kapok tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.^[84]

   The seeds of conifers, the largest group of gymnosperms, are enclosed in a
   cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be
   blown considerable distances once free from the cone.^[85] Sometimes the
   seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate
   it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and
   also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing
   vegetation.^[86] Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia
   cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure
   to high temperatures.^[87]

   The flame tree Delonix regia does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds
   through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart
   explosively on drying.^[84] The miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees
   produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the
   seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some
   species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start
   germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.^[88]^[89] These
   float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and
   successfully take root.^[84]

   [IMG]Cracked thorny skin of a Aesculus tree seed

   Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy receptacles
   and smaller fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue;
   animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the
   seeds, or swallow them so they pass through the gut to be deposited in the
   animal's droppings well away from the parent tree. The germination of some
   seeds is improved when they are processed in this way.^[90] Nuts may be
   gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately
   consumed.^[91] Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing
   softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring.^[92]
   Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears
   may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.^[93]

   The single extant species of Ginkgophyta (Ginkgo biloba) has fleshy seeds
   produced at the ends of short branches on female trees,^[94] and Gnetum, a
   tropical and subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of
   a shoot axis.^[95]

Evolutionary history

   [IMG]Lepidodendron, an extinct lycophyte tree [IMG]Palms and cycads as
   they might have appeared in the middle Tertiary
   Further information: Evolutionary history of plants

   The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew
   in forests in the Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been
   Wattieza, fossils of which have been found in New York state in 2007
   dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to
   this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.^[96] Both of
   these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be
   links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic
   period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and
   these may have appeared as a result of a whole genome duplication event
   which took place about 319 million years ago.^[97] Ginkgophyta was once a
   widespread diverse group^[98] of which the only survivor is the maidenhair
   tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is
   virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic
   deposits.^[99]

   During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the conifers flourished
   and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats.
   Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the
   Cretaceous period. These began to displace the conifers during the
   Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the
   globe.^[100] When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first
   of four glacial periods occurred, the forests retreated as the ice
   advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been
   covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next glacial
   period.^[100]

Ecology

   Further information: Forest

   Trees are an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem,^[101] providing
   essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of
   organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts,
   orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from
   branches;^[102] these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi
   provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including
   animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the
   ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth,
   leaf litter, and decaying wood that provide other habitat.^[103]^[104]
   Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help
   prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the
   maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.^[105]

   Many species of tree support their own specialised invertebrates. In their
   natural habitats, 284 different species of insect have been found on the
   English oak (Quercus robur)^[106] and 306 species of invertebrate on the
   Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua).^[107] Non-native tree species provide
   a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the
   sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has
   few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports a wide range
   of lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.^[108] Trees differ
   ecologically in the ease with which they can be found by herbivores. Tree
   apparency varies with a tree's size and semiochemical content, and with
   the extent to which it is concealed by nonhost neighbours from its insect
   pests.^[109]

   In ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the
   habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of
   tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and
   creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus
   mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations.^[110]
   Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging
   effects of cyclones and tsunamis.^[111]

Uses

  Food

   Further information: nut (fruit) and fruit

   Trees are the source of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits.
   Apples, pears, plums, cherries and citrus are all grown commercially in
   temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the
   tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and
   olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to
   make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica
   and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many
   rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for
   consumption.^[112] Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be
   described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These
   include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa),
   pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus
   dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many
   others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein,
   vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre.^[113] A variety of nut
   oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut,
   pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but
   they tend to spoil quickly.^[114]

   [IMG]Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) tapped to collect sap for maple syrup

   In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of sap at the end of the
   winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of
   the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a
   sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining
   10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is
   harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the
   liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse
   where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. Similarly in
   northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula
   pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented
   into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula
   lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap
   is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one
   litre of birch syrup.^[115]

   Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include cinnamon, made
   from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice,
   the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a
   seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and
   cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium
   aromaticum).^[116]

   Many trees have flowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees. The
   production of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the
   developing world where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using
   traditional methods.^[117] The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to
   make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be
   candied.^[118] Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark
   from the roots of the sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).

   The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some
   can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes
   them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those
   of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (in Thai food)^[119] and Ailanthus (in
   Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus
   nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used
   for flavouring food.^[116] Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a
   small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to
   make picking the leaves easier.^[120]

   Wood smoke can be used to preserve food. In the hot smoking process the
   food is exposed to smoke and heat in a controlled environment. The food is
   ready to eat when the process is complete, having been tenderised and
   flavoured by the smoke it has absorbed. In the cold process, the
   temperature is not allowed to rise above 100 °F (38 °C). The flavour of
   the food is enhanced but raw food requires further cooking. If it is to be
   preserved, meat should be cured before cold smoking.^[121]

  Fuel

   Main article: Wood fuel
   [IMG]Selling firewood at a market

   Wood has traditionally been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In
   less developed nations it may be the only fuel available and collecting
   firewood is often a time-consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel
   further and further afield in the search for fuel.^[122] It is often
   burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other
   fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity.
   Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such
   as wood pellets are available to burn.^[123]

   Charcoal can be made by slow pyrolysis of wood by heating it in the
   absence of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are
   burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them
   into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in
   barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.^[124]

  Timber

   Main articles: Wood and Timber
   [IMG]Roof trusses made from softwood

   Timber, "trees that are grown in order to produce wood"^[125] is cut into
   lumber (sawn wood) for use in construction. Wood has been an important,
   easily available material for construction since humans started building
   shelters. Engineered wood products are available which bind the particles,
   fibres or veneers of wood together with adhesives to form composite
   materials. Plastics have taken over from wood for some traditional
   uses.^[126]

   Wood is used in the construction of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles,
   poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers,
   fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets.
   In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses,
   roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor
   boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.^[127]

   [IMG]Trees in art: Weeping Willow, Claude Monet, 1918

   Wood is used to construct carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and
   in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes,
   ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs,
   brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs,
   wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs,
   oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.^[127]

   Wood is pulped for paper and used in the manufacture of cardboard and made
   into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard,
   hardboard, chipboard and plywood.^[127] The wood of conifers is known as
   softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.^[128]

  Art

   Besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have been used to
   create art. Living trees have been used in bonsai and in tree shaping, and
   both living and dead specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic
   shapes.^[129]

    Bonsai

   [IMG]Informal upright style of bonsai on a juniper tree
   Main article: Bonsai

   Bonsai (盆栽, lit. "Tray planting")^[130] is the practice of hòn non bộ
   originated in China and spread to Japan more than a thousand years ago,
   there are similar practices in other cultures like the living miniature
   landscapes of Vietnam hòn non bộ. The word bonsai is often used in English
   as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.^[131]

   The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and
   the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).^[132]
   Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or
   more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting,
   seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development.
   Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or
   shrub species^[133] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to
   remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some
   species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics,
   such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the
   compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even
   be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or
   hornbeam.^[134]

    Tree shaping

   Main article: Tree shaping
   [IMG]People trees, by Pooktre

   Tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees and other woody
   plants into man made shapes for art and useful structures. There are a few
   different methods^[135] of shaping a tree. There is a gradual method and
   there is an instant method. The gradual method slowly guides the growing
   tip along predetermined pathways over time whereas the instant method
   bends and weaves saplings 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft) long into a shape that
   becomes more rigid as they thicken up.^[136] Most artists use grafting of
   living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or functional structures and
   there are plans to grow "living houses" with the branches of trees
   knitting together to give a solid, weatherproof exterior combined with an
   interior application of straw and clay to provide a stucco-like inner
   surface.^[136]

   Tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the
   oldest known examples being the living root bridges built and maintained
   by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using the roots of the rubber tree
   (Ficus elastica).^[137]^[138]

  Bark

   [IMG]Recently stripped cork oak (Quercus suber)
   Further information: Bark (botany)

   Cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It
   is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an
   environmentally sustainable industry.^[139] More than half the world's
   cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine
   bottles.^[140] Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls,
   footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind
   instruments.^[140]

   The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe
   for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been
   used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after
   various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats
   containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the
   hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to
   bacterial attack.^[141]

   At least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of
   trees.^[142] Quinine originates from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was
   for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.^[143]
   Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the
   bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects.^[144] The
   anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in
   the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia).^[145] Other tree based
   drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the
   cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and
   the downy birch (Betula pubescens).^[142]

   The papery bark of the white birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used
   extensively by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes
   were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and
   fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges.^[146] Nowadays,
   bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and
   as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free
   compost.^[147]

  Ornamental trees

   Main article: Ornamental trees

   Trees create a visual impact in the same way as do other landscape
   features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden.
   They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers,
   fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a
   landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings
   of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living
   things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to
   year.^[148]

   Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as
   street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through
   evapotranspiration, absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept
   rainfall, and reduce the risk of flooding. Scientific studies show that
   street trees help cities be more sustainable, and improve the physical and
   mental wellbeing of the citizens.^[149] It has been shown that they are
   beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing
   stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.^[150] In
   London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street
   trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to
   one tree for every resident.^[151]

  Other uses

   [IMG]Latex collecting from a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)
   Further information: Resin, Latex, and Camphor

   Latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against
   herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the
   latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea
   brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the
   waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for
   which synthetic materials have proved less durable.^[152] The latex exuded
   by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is
   similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the "getah perca" tree
   Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea
   cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely
   been replaced by synthetic materials.^[153]

   Resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a
   viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile terpenes and is produced mostly
   by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings
   and in ten-pin bowling balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and
   the remaining product is called "rosin" and is used by stringed
   instrumentalists on their bows. Some resins contain essential oils and are
   used in incense and aromatherapy. Fossilised resin is known as amber and
   was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more
   recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or
   spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.^[154]

   The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil^[116] and
   the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus
   oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.^[155]

Threats

  Individual trees

   Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe
   storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the
   presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and
   reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce
   building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water
   stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and
   insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating
   trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and
   death.^[156]

  Conservation

   About a third of all tree species, some twenty thousand, are included in
   the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Of those, over eight thousand are
   globally threatened, including at least 1400 which are classed as
   "critically endangered".^[157]

Mythology

   Main article: Trees in mythology
   [IMG]Yggdrasil, the World Ash of Norse mythology

   Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts,
   certain trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special
   significance^[158] as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental
   objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often
   linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as
   oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs who
   inhabited trees.

   The Oubangui people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As
   the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive,
   the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time
   for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the
   individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.^[159]

   Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended
   towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as
   a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens.
   In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and
   branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it.^[160] In
   India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that
   emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be
   worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the
   devout who tie threads round the trunk.^[161] Democracy started in North
   America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy,
   inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their
   weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus
   strobus).^[162] In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and
   the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of
   Eden.^[163]

   Sacred groves exist in China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They are places
   where the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred
   or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural
   penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the
   felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves may be
   the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater
   than the surrounding area.^[164] Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as
   Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or
   Kadambariyamman, associated with the cadamba tree, were seen as
   manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in
   abundance.^[165]

Superlative trees

   [IMG]The General Sherman Tree, thought to be the world's largest by volume
   Main article: List of superlative trees

   Trees have a theoretical maximum height of 130 m (430 ft),^[166] but the
   tallest known specimen on earth is believed to be a coast redwood (Sequoia
   sempervirens) at Redwood National Park, California. It has been named
   Hyperion and is 115.85 m (380.1 ft) tall.^[167] In 2006, it was reported
   to be 379.1 ft (115.5 m) tall.^[168] The tallest known broad-leaved tree
   is a mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) growing in Tasmania with a height
   of 99.8 m (327 ft).^[169]

   The largest tree by volume is believed to be a giant sequoia
   (Sequoiadendron giganteum) known as the General Sherman Tree in the
   Sequoia National Park in Tulare County, California. Only the trunk is used
   in the calculation and the volume is estimated to be 1,487 m^3
   (52,500 cu ft).^[170]

   The oldest living tree with a verified age is also in California. It is a
   Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) growing in the White
   Mountains. It has been dated by drilling a core sample and counting the
   annual rings. It is estimated to currently be 5,078 years old.^[a]^[171]

   A little farther south, at Santa Maria del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the
   tree with the broadest trunk. It is a Montezuma cypress (Taxodium
   mucronatum) known as Árbol del Tule and its diameter at breast height is
   11.62 m (38.1 ft) giving it a girth of 36.2 m (119 ft). The tree's trunk
   is far from round and the exact dimensions may be misleading as the
   circumference includes much empty space between the large buttress
   roots.^[172]

       The diversity of tree species in the boreal forest is quite low, with
       black spruce (Picea mariana), larch or tamarack (Larix laricina), and
       white spruce (P. glauca) the most common species. The former two
       species generally occupy wet sites with poorly drained mineral or
       organic soils, while white spruce is the climatic climax species on
       sites that are drier and higher in nutrient content. Balsam fir (Abies
       balsamea) is a dominant tree species in the eastern half of the biome.

               Want To Cool Down Honolulu? Plant A Lot More Trees

   There are a multitude of “heat islands” across Oahu that harm humans and
   increase economic costs.

   There are a multitude of “heat islands” across Oahu that harm humans and
   increase economic costs.

   Al Gore once said, “The best available technology for pulling carbon
   dioxide from the air is something called a tree.”

   [IMG][IMG]

   True, Mr. Gore. Trees provide cooling at a global scale by sequestering
   carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming.
   Trees are also the smartest available technology at the local level for
   cooling our homes, schools, and parks through evaporation and shading.

   Yet Honolulu is losing trees. Why? It’s a loss of a tree here, a tree
   there. In short, lots of little things that collectively add up to a big
   problem. 

   This is what the youth, in a Trees for Honolulu’s Future initiative called
   “Heat Island Investigators,” discovered over the past year. Heat islands
   are locales often associated with urban development that experience higher
   temperatures than surrounding areas.

   Honolulu has many such locations where buildings and roads absorb and
   reemit the sun’s heat. Urban areas, where human-built infrastructure like
   this is concentrated and greenery is limited, become “islands” of higher
   temperatures relative to outlying areas.

   Why are trees so good at mitigating heat islands?

     * Trees act like pumps as roots gather water from the soil and release
       it to the atmosphere where it evaporates, cooling the air in a process
       called transpiration.
     * Trees act like umbrellas as leaves in the canopy intercept and reflect
       solar radiation keeping surfaces below cooler because they are
       shielded from direct sun.

   Groups of trees are most impactful. Isolated trees provide some, but
   limited cooling as wind passes warmer air from adjacent areas beneath the
   canopy in a process called advection. Quite simply, more trees equals more
   cooling.

   The Heat Island Investigators initiative included two sites, both of which
   are underserved areas that are heat islands: Aiea Intermediate School and
   Makalapa Neighborhood Park (via Parents and Children Together program at
   Puuwai Momi public housing).

Taking The Temperature

   At each site student scientists developed maps of current conditions,
   including measuring and plotting trees and temperatures, and identified
   solutions by applying experiential place-based learning using an array of
   sophisticated equipment and a rigorous testing regime.

   Temperature, light, and canopy conditions were measured under and adjacent
   to a number of trees at several local parks. Measurements in the shade and
   sun were taken simultaneously at cardinal directions to account for
   differences in canopy density as well as time of day and year.

   Measurements of temperature and light from canopy shade and in the
   adjacent sunlight show the difference that shade can make. A partial gap
   in the canopy shows intermediate temperature and brightness. Sunlight
   explains 99% difference in temperature. (Courtesy Daniel Dinell)

   Now here’s where findings got interesting. Measurements of surface
   temperature and light associated with sun and shade under and around a
   Monkeypod tree illustrate the relationship of sun exposure to surface
   temperature. Sensors in the sun were about 12 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
   and it was about 20 times brighter whereas under a partial gap in the
   canopy light and temperature were intermediate.

   It’s no big surprise that shaded surface temperatures were cooler, yet the
   ambient air temperature, measured in a solar radiation shield, showed only
   a 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit difference between sun and shade.

   The conclusion? Air isn’t necessarily cooler in the shade, but surfaces
   that are in the shade stay cooler.

   Even without trees, in areas getting the same amount of solar radiation,
   such as a grassy field versus on an outdoor basketball court, it will feel
   cooler on the grass. There are other factors such as wind and humidity as
   well — the takeaway here is air temperature isn’t the only factor in how
   hot, or cool, one feels.

   It’s not just the youth who have figured this out. The City and County of
   Honolulu Climate Change Commission has identified heat impact as both a
   stress through urban heat islands and as a shock through heat waves.

   Honolulu has a multitude of heat islands that cause serious human impacts
   such as heat-related mortality and morbidity, as well as economic costs
   such as increased peak electricity demand. Trees aren’t the only answer to
   this situation, but they sure are a smart, cost-effective, response.

   Fortunately, change at Makalapa Neighborhood Park, featured in a May 2023
   Civil Beat story, is underway. In September 2023, after Noah Kindaro, a
   10-year-old youth, testified at the Honolulu City Council Committee on
   Parks, the park’s lights were turned on the next evening.

   A Friends of Makalapa Park community group is in the process of being
   established. And the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation is
   exploring planting shade trees. Read on to discover why trees are an
   excellent way to help this, and other areas of Honolulu, reduce how hot it
   feels.

How To Help

   How can you make a difference in reducing the urban heat island effect?

   Plant a tree in your own yard. Myriad resources for advice abound,
   including at TreesForHonolululu.org, local nurseries, and certified
   arborists to help you select the right tree in the right place and provide
   the right care.

   Volunteer! Numerous organizations actively plant and maintain trees. Where
   to start? The Events listing at TreesForHonolululu.org is a good place.

   Request a street tree. Call the City’s Division of Urban Forestry at (808)
   971-7151 or email DUF@honolulu.gov. Keep in mind that not all requests
   will be approved as the location must meet various standards, however,
   staff will review and consider your request. If approved, the city will
   plant and prune the tree, but you will need to commit to watering the
   trees to help get it established.

   Advocate for urban trees as if your life depends on it, because it does.

   See Haleiwa_Dad below...Lollipopped trees seem to be a spreading cancer.
   It takes work to maintain landscaped parks and parking lots, etc. "Too
   much humbug" to rake leaves and seedpods from all over.Root of problem
   (pun intended) is landscape designers seem clueless about what to plant
   where. That is tied to the fact that nurseries seem not to be able to
   invest in longterm housing of appropriate trees to get them up to size.
   Then, when a contract is had to plant parking medians, designers scramble
   and end up with Enny Kine Stuffs. Lots of beautiful quick-growing kou with
   their abundant deadly spherical seed pods, kamani that grow way too big,
   loulu from Fiji rather than one of our HawaiÊ»i ones, and the usual
   quick-turnover natives: hibiscuses , pÅhinahina, Ê»Äkia, Ê»ukiÊ»uki,
   etc. Often overlooked are Ê»aÊ»aliÊ»i, pili, wiliwili, alaheÊ»e, lama, and
   of course our beloved Ê»ÅhiÊ»a. Why? No moÊ». No can get. Too expensive.
   Just think: If Ê»ÅhiÊ»a were planted all over in new and old
   developments, along with their friends to form kÄ«puka, weÊ»d perhaps
   ensure its survival against ROD. But to do that, we need to invest in
   their cultivation. Same too with loulu. And, educate everyone.

   Saw some interesting studies out of warming European cities; they studied
   foot traffic in downtowns where large sail-like canopies had been
   installed over the streets and groups of trees were planted in frequent
   pocket parks. Surface heat was greatly reduced in the resulting shade and
   shoppers returned to the community because they werenât broiling in sun.
   The shade was available immediately and maintenance costs minimal.

   There is zero enforcement of building codes that require trees and shrubs
   planted in new or expanded parking lots and landscaped street-facing
   planters. Typically the construction contractor installs per plans, then
   the owners/maintainers let 'em die, improperly prune by stunting and
   'lollypop' rounding over, or actually remove and not replace. I've seen a
   maintenance guy torture trees, at a gas station along Kam Hwy, by
   literally plucking off the leaves, from a ladder, repeatedly, until it
   died. No one ever comes back and makes 'em replant the trees. Better
   solution would be groups of trees or a large tree, allowed to grow large,
   on a corner or edge and not try to spot lollypop trees every so many
   stalls like you see. The key is actual shaded areas on the parking lot,
   not how many shadeless lolly pops you have.

  Convicted tree thief’s ‘right to survive’ trumps Iowa law, his lawyer argues

        By: Jared Strong - January 2, 2024 6:56 pm

   trees from state land. DNR officials said his property, shown here, had

   A northwest Iowa man had the right to cut down and take trees from a
   public wildlife management area because he needed the wood for shelter and
   heat, his attorney argues.

   That argument is part of Jason Lavant Ferguson’s repeated efforts to
   overrule a jury’s unanimous decision in November that found him guilty of
   felony theft and 50 timber violations.

   [IMG] Jason Levant Ferguson, 41, of Rolfe (Booking photo courtesy of
   Pocahontas County jail)

   The 41-year-old rural Rolfe man was accused of taking more than 100 trees
   from the Stoddard Wildlife Management Area in Pocahontas County without
   permission, including a slow-growing bur oak that was about six feet in
   diameter at its base.

   He is set to be sentenced Jan. 26 and faces up to five years in prison for
   the theft charge and one year apiece for each of the timber violations.

   A district court judge last month rejected Ferguson’s claims that an
   800-year-old English charter empowers him to take trees from public land
   and that he deserves a new trial. Subsequently, his attorney expanded on
   that claim and filed a motion in arrest of judgment, which asks a judge
   not to impose the jury’s verdict because it was made in error.

   “The defendant’s activities can be summarized as cutting wood to rebuild
   his home and heat his home so he didn’t die from hypothermia,” wrote
   Ferguson’s attorney, Kevin Fors, of Harcourt. “These are the very acts
   protected by the (Charter of the Forest) when given in 1215 and reaffirmed
   in the third version released in 1217 and ratified by later kings.”

   Ferguson told state conservation officers that he had planned to use some
   of the timber to build a house. In seeking a new trial, Ferguson had
   argued that the English charter’s provisions — which established rights of
   commoners to use public lands — are part of the United States’ unwritten
   “common law” that the country retained when it broke from England.

   But District Court Judge Derek Johnson decided last month that the charter
   applies to the forests of England, not the United States.

   Nevertheless, Ferguson’s attorney continues to insist that Americans have
   a fundamental right to harvest lumber and firewood from public land. He
   pointed to federal provisions that allow people to take trees from
   national parks under certain circumstances.

   “I am arguing in this time and in this place it is morally wrong and
   legally wrong to prosecute an individual for subsisting on forest products
   owned by the sovereign,” Fors wrote in his recent motion. “As a human
   right you have a right to survive even if it doesn’t conform to state
   imposed restrictions.”

   Ferguson was successful last year in defending himself against numerous
   felony drug and weapons charges that stemmed from the tree theft
   investigation. The judge decided that search warrants that uncovered
   evidence of marijuana and methamphetamine production at Ferguson’s
   property were improperly approved, and that the evidence could not be used
   to prosecute Ferguson.

   It’s unclear when the judge will rule on Fors’ recent arrested-judgment
   motion.

 As tree species face decline, ‘assisted migration’ gains popularity in Pacific
                                   Northwest

   By NATHAN GILLES, Columbia Insight
   PORTLAND, Oregon Jan. 2, 2024 2 p.m.

‘Assisted migration’ means humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could migrate on
their own

   Douglas fir trees that died as a result of insect damage following heat
   stress are visible in the Willamette National Forest, Ore., Friday, Oct.
   27, 2023. As native trees in the Pacific Northwest die off due to climate
   change, the U.S. Forest Service and others are turning to a strategy
   called "assisted migration."

   As native trees in the Pacific Northwest die off due to climate changes,
   the U.S. Forest Service in Portland, Oregon, and citizen groups around
   Puget Sound, Washington, are turning to a deceptively simple climate
   adaptation strategy called “assisted migration.”

   THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

   As the world’s climate warms, tree-growing ranges in the Northern
   Hemisphere are predicted to move farther north and higher in elevation.

   Trees, of course, can’t get up and walk to their new climatic homes. This
   is where assisted migration is supposed to lend a hand.

   The idea is that humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
   moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could
   migrate on their own.

   Yet not everyone agrees on what type of assisted migration the region
   needs — or that it’s always a good thing.

   In the Pacific Northwest, a divide has emerged between groups advocating
   for assisted migration that would help struggling native trees, and one
   that could instead see native species replaced on the landscape by trees
   from the south, including coast redwoods and giant sequoias.

   “There is a huge difference between assisted population migration and
   assisted species migration,” said Michael Case, forest ecologist at the
   Virginia-based Nature Conservancy.

   Related: Extreme heat represents a new threat to trees and plants in the
   Pacific Northwest

   Case currently runs an assisted population migration experiment at the
   Conservancy’s Ellsworth Creek Preserve in western Washington.

   Assisted population migration involves moving a native species' seeds, and
   by extension its genes, within its current growing range.

   By contrast, assisted species migration involves moving a species well
   outside its existing range, such as introducing redwoods and sequoias to
   Washington.

   A third form of assisted migration, called “range expansion,” amounts to
   moving a species just beyond its current growing range.

   Case’s project involves testing whether breeds of native Douglas fir and
   western hemlock from drier parts of the Pacific Northwest can be used to
   help western Washington forests adapt to climate change. He says the
   Nature Conservancy is focusing on population migration because it has
   fewer ecological risks.

   “Whenever you plant something in an area where it is not locally found you
   increase the risk of failure,” Case said. “You increase the risk of
   disturbing potential ecosystem functions and processes.”

   Population migration is the only form of assisted migration currently
   practiced nationwide by the Forest Service, according to David Lytle, the
   agency’s deputy chief for research and development.

   “We are very, very cautious and do not engage in the long-distance
   movement and establishment of plant material outside and disjunct from the
   historic range of a species,” said Lytle.

   The Forest Service is pursing assisted population migration because it’s
   likely to have few if any “negative consequences” to ecosystems, he said.

   Douglas Tallamy, professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the
   University of Delaware, said one potential negative consequence of species
   migration is the possibility that native caterpillars might not eat the
   leaves of migrated nonnative tree species. Because caterpillars feed birds
   and other animals, this could lead to disruptions to the food web.

   This could happen if the city of Portland migrates oak species from places
   to the south, Tallamy noted. “Oaks are the most important plant for
   supporting wildlife that we have in North America,” he said, “but when you
   move them out of range, the things that are adapted to eating them no
   longer have access to them.”

Portland’s experimentation with assisted migration of trees

   The city of Portland’s Urban Forestry program is currently experimenting
   with the assisted migration of 11 tree species, including three oak
   species to the south: California black oak, canyon live oak and interior
   live oak.

   Asked via email about potential ecological disruptions Portland’s City
   Forester @amp; Urban Forestry Manager Jenn Cairo responded: “We use research
   from universities, state and federal sources, and local and regional field
   practitioner experience.”

   Another advocate for species migration is the Puget Sound-based,
   citizen-led PropagationNation. The organization has planted trees in
   several parks in the Seattle area and has the ambitious goal of “bringing
   a million coast redwoods and giant sequoias to the Northwest,” according
   to its website.

   The PropagationNation website also recommends planting redwoods in areas
   where native western red cedar, western hemlock, Sitka spruce and big leaf
   maple already grow.

   Western red cedar, western hemlock and big leaf maple have all seen
   die-offs and growth declines in recent years tied to climate.

   Philip Stielstra, PropagationNation’s founder and president, and a retired
   Boeing employee, declined to comment for this story.

   David Milarch, founder of the Michigan-based Archangel Ancient Tree
   Archive, which has supplied PropagationNation with redwoods and sequoias,
   says his trees aren’t intended to replace Pacific Northwest native
   species.

   “All we are doing is extending the range (of redwoods and sequoias) north
   in the hopes that they will still be here in 100 to 200 years and not join
   the list of trees that are going extinct,” said Milarch.

Widespread assisted migration may be risky, Forest Service says

   Robert Slesak, research forester at the Pacific Northwest Research
   Station, runs the Forest Service’s Experimental Network for Assisted
   Migration and Establishment Silviculture, or ENAMES project, which
   oversees population migration sites in Washington, Oregon and California.

   Slesak called moving redwoods north a “risky proposition.” He said he has
   serious concerns about both assisted species migration and assisted
   migration efforts that lack experimental rigor.

   “Widespread assisted species migration without a lot of experimental
   results to guide it is risky,” said Slesak. “Everyone knows we need to do
   some kind of action related to climate, but there’s a real risk of making
   it worse.”

   Nevertheless, with the effects of climate change increasing, it’s a risk
   increasingly being assumed by public and private groups around the Pacific
   Northwest.

                    Compiler vs. Interpreter in Programming

   Compilers and interpreters are used to convert a high-level language into
   machine code. However, there are differences between how and when they
   work.

   I still remember a discussion with a colleague in which I said, “That’s
   the transpiler,” and he replied, “The…what?”

   If you’ve never heard that name, you’re not alone. As developers, we all
   get used to writing code in a high-level language that humans can
   understand. However, computers can only understand a program written in a
   binary system known as machine code.

   To speak to a computer in its non-human language, we came up with two
   solutions: interpreters and compilers. Ironically, most of us know very
   little about them, although they’re a part of our daily coding life.

Compilers vs. Interpreters Explained

     * Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming
       language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the
       program runs.
     * Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level
       programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. 

   In this post, I’ll dive into the journey of translating a high-level
   language into a machine code ready for execution. I’ll focus on the inner
   workings of the two key players in this game, the compiler and the
   interpreter, and break down the related concepts.

    

Compilers vs. Interpreters: How Do They Work?

   Compilers and interpreters have long been used as computer programs to
   transform code. But they work in different ways:

     * A compiler translates code written in a high-level programming
       language into a lower-level language like assembly language, object
       code and  machine code (binary 1 and 0 bits). It converts the code
       ahead of time before the program runs.
     * An interpreter translates the code line-by-line when the program is
       running. You’ve likely used interpreters unknowingly at some point in
       your work career.

Compilers vs. Interpreters: Advantages and Disadvantages

   Both compilers and interpreters have pros and cons:

     * A compiler takes in the entire program and requires a lot of time to
       analyze the source code. Whereas the interpreter takes a single line
       of code and very little time to analyze it.
     * Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.
     * A compiler displays all errors after compilation. If your code has
       mistakes, it will not compile. But the interpreter displays errors of
       each line one by one.
     * Interpretation does not replace compilation completely.
     * Compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons like
       faster performance and smaller memory footprint.

   A high-level programming language is usually referred to as “compiled
   language” or “interpreted language.” However, in practice, they can have
   both compiled and interpreted implementations. C, for example, is called a
   compiled language, despite the existence of C interpreters. The first
   JavaScript engines were simple interpreters, but all modern engines use
   just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance reasons.

    

4 Common Types of Interpreters to Know

   Interpreters were used as early as 1952 to ease programming and also
   translate between low-level machine languages. The first interpreted
   high-level language was Lisp. Python, Ruby, Perl and PHP are other
   examples of programming languages that use interpreters.

   Below is a list of interpreter’s types:

4 Types of Interpreters

    1. Bytecode interpreter
    2. Threaded code interpreter
    3. Abstract syntax tree interpreter
    4. Justin-in-time compilation

    

  1. Bytecode Interpreter

   The trend toward bytecode interpretation and just-in-time compilation
   blurs the distinction between compilers and interpreters. Bytecode
   interpreters can process up to 256 instructions, with each instruction
   starting with a byte. 

    

  2. Threaded Code Interpreter

   Unlike bytecode interpreters, threaded code interpreters use pointers
   instead of bytes. Each instruction is a word pointing to a function or an
   instruction sequence, possibly followed by a parameter. The number of
   different instructions is limited by the available memory and address
   space.

   Forth code, which is used in Open Firmware systems, is a classical example
   of threaded code. The source code is compiled into a bytecode known as “F
   code,” which a virtual machine then interprets.

    

  3. Abstract Syntax Tree Interpreter

   If you’re a TypeScript developer with some familiarity of the TypeScript
   architecture, you may have heard about the abstract syntax tree (AST).

   AST is an approach to transform the source code into an optimized abstract
   syntax tree, then execute the program following this tree structure, or
   use it to generate native code just-in-time.

   AST keeps the global program structure and relations between statements.
   This allows the system to perform better analysis during runtime and makes
   AST a better intermediate format for just-in-time compilers than bytecode
   representation.

   However, for interpreters, AST causes more overhead. Interpreters walking
   the abstract syntax tree are slower than those generating bytecode.

    

  4. Just-in-Time Compilation

   Just-in-time compilation (JIT) is a technique in which the intermediate
   representation is compiled to native machine code at runtime.

    

10 Common Types of Compilers to Know

   Below are the common types of compilers you should know.

10 Types of Compilers

    1. Cross-compiler
    2. Native compiler
    3. Bootstrap compiler
    4. Decompiler
    5. Source-to-source compiler
    6. Language rewriter
    7. Bytecode compiler
    8. Just-in-time compiler
    9. AOT compilation
   10. Assembler

    

  1. Cross-compiler

   A cross-compiler is one that runs on a computer whose CPU or operating
   system differs from the one on which the code it produces will run.

    

  2. Native Compiler

   A native compiler produces an output that would run on the same type of
   computer and operating system as the compiler itself.

    

  3. Bootstrap Compiler

   Bootstrap compiler is a compiler written in the language that it intends
   to compile.

    

  4. Decompiler

   A decompiler translates code from a low-level language to a higher level
   one.

    

  5. Source-to-Source Compiler (Transpiler)

   A source-to-source compiler is a program that translates between
   high-level languages. This type of compiler is also known as a
   transcompiler or transpiler.

   Some examples of a transpiler include:

     * Emscripten: This transpiles C/C++ to JavaScript.
     * Babel: This transpiles JavaScript code from ES6+ to ES5.
     * Cfront: The original compiler for C++ (from around 1983). It used C as
       its target language and created C code with no indent style and no
       pretty C intermediate code, since the generated code was not usually
       intended to be readable by humans.

    

  6. A Language Rewriter

   This is usually a program translating form of expressions without a change
   of language.

    

  7. Bytecode Compiler

   A compiler that translates a high-level language into an intermediate
   simple language that a bytecode interpreter or virtual machine can
   interpret. Examples include: Bytecode compilers for Java and Python.

    

  8. Just-in-Time Compiler (JIT Compiler)

   A JIT compiler defers compilation until runtime. It generally runs inside
   an interpreter.

   Examples of a JIT compiler include:

     * The earliest published JIT compiler is attributed to LISP in 1960.
     * The latter technique appeared in languages such as Smalltalk in the
       1980s.
     * Since then, JIT compilation has gained mainstream attention amongst
       modern languages like Java, .NET Framework, Python and most modern
       JavaScript implementations.

   In Java, source files are first compiled and converted into .class files
   that contain Java bytecode, a highly optimized set of instructions, then a
   bytecode interpreter executes the bytecode, and later the JIT compiler
   translates the bytecode to machine code.

   Java bytecode can either be interpreted at runtime by a virtual machine,
   or compiled at load time or runtime into native code. Modern JVM
   implementations use the compilation approach, so after the initial startup
   time the performance is equivalent to native code.

    

  9. AOT Compilation

   Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation is the approach of compiling a
   higher-level programming language, or an intermediate representation such
   as Java bytecode, before the runtime.

   An example of this is the Angular framework. This uses an ahead-of-time
   (AOT) compiler to transform HTML and TypeScript code into JavaScript code
   during the build time to provide a faster rendering later on the browser
   when the code is running.

    

  10. Assembler

   An assembler translates human-readable assembly language into machine
   code. This compilation process is called assembly. The inverse program
   that converts machine code to assembly language is called a disassembler.

   An assembly language (ASM) is a low-level programming language in which
   there is a dependence on the machine code instructions. That’s why every
   assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer
   architecture.

Why Compilers and Interpreters Are Important

   Both compilers and interpreters are computer programs that convert a code
   written in a high-level language into a lower-level or machine code
   understood by computers. However, there are differences in how they work
   and when to use them.

   Even if you’re not going to implement the next compiler or interpreter,
   these insights should help to improve your knowledge of the tools you use
   as a developer every day.

                      How to Parse and Generate HTML in Go

   By Ukeje Chukwuemeriwo Goodness (Goodnessuc)
   Published Feb 1, 2023

   Parsing and generating HTML is a no-brainer with the help of Golang's html
   and html/template package.

   random green symbols.

   Parsing is analyzing and interpreting a document's structure. The parsing
   process may include extracting specific elements, attributes, or data from
   the document and verifying that the document is well-formatted while
   following specific standards or rules. Parsing is mainly used for
   extracting data from web pages or manipulating the structure of web pages
   before displaying them to users.

   Go provides packages for working with documents, including the HTML and
   XML formats popularly used in webpages. The html package provides
   functions for tokenizing and parsing HTML.

The HTML Package

   The html package provides an HTML5-compliant tokenizer and parser for
   parsing and manipulating HTML documents, traversing the parse tree, and
   manipulating the tree structure. The html package is a built-in package of
   Go’s standard library.

   One of the main features of the html package is the Parse function that
   can parse HTML documents and return the root node of the parse tree, from
   where you can use functions like the FirstChild and NextSibling to
   navigate the tree and extract information from the document. The package
   also provides the ParseFragment function for parsing fragments of HTML
   documents.

   The EscapeString function is handy for escaping special characters in
   strings for safer inclusion in HTML; you can use this function to prevent
   cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by converting special characters to
   their corresponding HTML entities.

   To get started with the html package, you can import the package into your
   Go project files.

  import "golang.org/x/net/html"
 

   The html package doesn't provide any functions for generating HTML.
   Instead, you can use html/template package, which offers a set of
   functions for generating HTML templates. The html/template package
   provides a function template.HTMLEscape for writing escaped versions of
   HTML to a response writer.

   The html/template package is also part of the standard library, and here’s
   how you can import the package.

  import "html/template"
 

   The html package is the most popularly used templating package in the Go
   ecosystem and supports various operations and data types.

Parsing HTML in Go

   The Parse function of the html package helps with parsing HTML text and
   documents. The Parse function takes in an io.Reader instance as it’s a
   first argument containing the file document and an *html.Node instance,
   which is the root node of the HTML document

   Here’s how you can use the Parse function to parse a webpage and return
   all the URLs on the web page.

  import (
     "fmt"
     "golang.org/x/net/html"
     "net/http"
 )

 func main() {
     // Send an HTTP GET request to the example.com web page
     resp, err := http.Get("https://www.example.com")
     if err != nil {
         fmt.Println("Error:", err)
         return
     }
     defer resp.Body.Close()

     // Use the html package to parse the response body from the request
     doc, err := html.Parse(resp.Body)
     if err != nil {
         fmt.Println("Error:", err)
         return
     }

     
     // Find and print all links on the web page
     var links []string
     var link func(*html.Node)
     link = func(n *html.Node) {
         if n.Type == html.ElementNode @amp;@amp; n.Data == "a" {
             for _, a := range n.Attr {
                 if a.Key == "href" {
                     // adds a new link entry when the attribute matches
                     links = append(links, a.Val)
                 }
             }
         }

         // traverses the HTML of the webpage from the first child node
         for c := n.FirstChild; c != nil; c = c.NextSibling {
             link(c)
         }
     }
     link(doc)

     // loops through the links slice
     for _, l := range links {
         fmt.Println("Link:", l)
     }
 }
 

   The main function sends an HTTP GET request to the website with the Get
   function of the http package and retrieves the page response body. The
   Parse function of the html package parses the response body and returns
   the HTML document.

   The links variable is the slice of strings that will hold the URLs from
   the webpage. The link function takes in the pointer reference to the Node
   method for the html package, and the Key method of the attribute instance
   from the node returns data contained in a specified attribute (in this
   case, href). The function traverses the document with the NextSibling
   method from the FirstChild node to print every URL on the webpage.
   Finally, the for loop prints all the URLs from the links slice.

   Here’s the result of the operation.

   result of retrieving links from a webpage

Generating HTML in Go

   The html/template package provides a set of functions for the safe and
   efficient parsing and execution of HTML templates. The package is designed
   for use in conjunction with the html package, which provides functions for
   parsing and manipulating HTML.

   You can generate HTML for server-side rendering with the html/template
   package. Generating HTML is handy for many use cases like sending emails,
   server-side frontend rendering, and many more. You get to use built-in Go
   data types like maps and structs to interact and manipulate the HTML of
   your webpage.

   You’ll need to understand Go HTML templating syntax to successfully
   generate HTML with the html/template package.

  import (
     "html/template"
     "os"
 )

 type webPage struct {
     Title string
     Heading string
     Text string
 }

 func main() {
     // Define the template
     tmpl := `
 @lt;!DOCTYPE html@gt;
 @lt;html@gt;
 @lt;head@gt;
     @lt;title@gt;{{.Title}}@lt;/title@gt;
 @lt;/head@gt;
 @lt;body@gt;
     @lt;h1@gt;{{.Heading}}@lt;/h1@gt;
     @lt;p@gt;{{.Text}}@lt;/p@gt;
 @lt;/body@gt;
 @lt;/html@gt;`

     // Define the data to be used in the template
     web := webPage{
         Title: "An Example Page",
         Heading: "Welcome to my website!",
         Text: "This is the home page of my website.",
     }

     // Create a new template and parse the template string
     t, err := template.New("webpage").Parse(tmpl)
     if err != nil {
         panic(err)
     }

     // Execute the template and write the result to stdout
     err = t.Execute(os.Stdout, web )
     if err != nil {
         panic(err)
     }
 }
 

   The tmpl variable holds the HTML string. The HTML string uses Go
   templating syntax to define the page title, an h1 header, and a paragraph
   of text. The webPage struct defines the data fields for the webpage with
   the Title, Heading, and Text fields.

   The Parse method of the New function of the template package creates and
   parses a new template with the template string. The Execute function of
   the new template instance executes the template with the data from your
   struct instance and returns the result to the standard output (in this
   case, it prints the result to the console).

Build Web Applications With Go

   Learning about parsing and generating HTML with Go is one step in the
   right direction toward building more sophisticated web applications with
   Go. You can use frameworks like Gin and Echo and routers like Gorilla Mux
   and the Chi Router to build the server side of your web application.

   These packages are built on the net/http package (the built-in package for
   interacting with HTTP in Go) and abstract the complexities of setting up
   servers and routers in Go.

                      How Database B-Tree Indexing Works 

   B-tree is used for indexing and is a data structure that provides sorted
   data and allows searches, sequential access, attachments and removals in
   sorted order.

   When we think about the performance of a database, indexing is the first
   thing that comes to the mind. Here, we’re going to look into how database
   indexing works on a database. 

B-Tree Indexing Explained

   B-tree indexing is the process of sorting large blocks of data to make
   searching through that data faster and easier. A B-tree stores data such
   that each node contains keys in ascending order. Each of these keys has
   two references to another two child nodes. The left side child node keys
   are less than the current keys, and the right side child node keys are
   more than the current keys. Its search time is O(log(n)). 

   The architectural details described below are for the SQLite 2.x database
   architecture. You can find out the back end implementation of SQLite 2.5.0
   with tests.

    

What Is B-tree?

   A B-tree is a data structure that provides sorted data and allows
   searches, sequential access, attachments and removals in sorted order. The
   B-tree is highly capable of storing systems that write large blocks of
   data. The B-tree simplifies the binary search tree by allowing nodes with
   more than two children. Below is a B-tree example.

   Madushan

   B-tree stores data such that each node contains keys in ascending order.
   Each of these keys has two references to another two child nodes. The left
   side child node keys are less than the current keys, and the right side
   child node keys are more than the current keys. If a single node has “n”
   number of keys, then it can have maximum “n+1” child nodes.

Why B-Tree Indexing Is Necessary

   Imagine that you need to store a list of numbers in a file and search a
   given number on that list. The simplest solution is to store data in an
   array and append values when new values come in. But if you need to check
   if a given value exists in the array, then you need to search through each
   of the array elements one by one and check whether the given value
   exists. 

   If you’re lucky, you might find the given value in the first element. But
   in the worst case scenario, the value could be the last element in the
   array. We denote this worst case as O(n) in asymptotic notation. This
   means if your array size is “n,” at most, you need to complete “n” number
   of searches to find a given value in an array.

   How could you improve this time? The easiest solution is to sort the array
   and use binary search to find the value. Whenever you insert a value into
   the array, it should maintain order. The search starts by selecting a
   value from the middle of the array. Then it compares the selected value
   with the search value. If the selected value is greater than the search
   value, then it ignores the left side of the array and searches the value
   on the right side, and vice versa.

   Illustration of a binary searchIllustration of a binary search. | Image:
   Dhanushka Madushan

   Here, we try to search key 15 from the array 3,6,8,11,15 and 18, which is
   already in sorted order. If you do a normal search, then it will take five
   units of time, since the element is in the fifth position. But in a binary
   search, it will only take three searches.

   If we apply this binary search to all of the elements in the array, then
   it would be as follows.

   Illustration of a binary search to all elementsIllustration of a binary
   search to all elements. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   Look familiar? It’s a binary tree. This is the simplest form of the
   B-tree. For a binary tree, we can use pointers instead of keeping data in
   a sorted array. Mathematically, we can prove that the worst case search
   time for a binary tree is O(log(n)). 

   The concept of Binary tree can be extended into a more generalized form,
   which is known as B-tree. Instead of having a single entry for a single
   node, B-tree uses an array of entries for a single node and has references
   to a child node for each of these entries. Below are some time complexity
   comparisons of each pre-described method.

   structures. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

    

B+Tree vs. B-Tree: What’s the Difference?

   B+ tree is another data structure that’s used to store data and looks
   almost the same as the B-tree. The only difference is that B+ tree stores
   data on the leaf nodes. This means that all non-leaf node values are
   duplicated in leaf nodes again. Below is a sample B+tree.

   An illustration of a B+treeAn illustration of a B+tree. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

    The 13, 30, 9, 11, 16 and 38 non-leaf values are again repeated in leaf
   nodes. 

   Leaf nodes include all values and all of the records are in sorted order.
   B+tree allows you to do the same search as B-tree, but it also allows you
   to  travel through all the values in a leaf node if we put a pointer to
   each leaf node as follows.

   B+tree with leaf node referencing. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

    

How Is B-Tree Indexing Used in a Database?

   When B-tree comes to the database indexing, this data structure gets a
   little complicated because it doesn’t just have a key, it also has a value
   associated with the key. This value is a reference to the actual data
   record. The key and value together are called a payload.

   Assume the following three-column table needs to be stored on a database:

   three column data tableA three-column data record. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   First, the database creates a unique random index (or primary key) for
   each of the given records and converts the relevant rows into a byte
   stream. Then, it stores each of the keys and record byte streams on a
   B+tree. Here, the random index used as the key for indexing. The key and
   record byte stream is altogether known as Payload. The resulting B+tree
   could be represented as follows.

   A B+tree on database pagesA B+tree on database pages. | Image: Dhanushka
   Madushan

   Here you can see that all records are stored in the leaf nodes of the
   B+tree and index and are used as the key to create a B+tree. No records
   are stored on non-leaf nodes. Each of the leaf nodes references the next
   record in the tree. A database can perform a binary search by using the
   index or sequential search by searching through every element by only
   traveling through the leaf nodes.

   If no indexing is used, then the database reads each of these records to
   find the given record. When indexing is enabled, the database creates
   three B-trees for each of the columns in the table, as follows. Here the
   key is the B-tree key used to index. The index is the reference to the
   actual data record:

   B-tree used as an index to the actual recordB-tree used as an index to the
   actual record. | Image: Dhanushka Madushan

   When indexing is used first, the database searches a given key in
   correspondence to B-tree and gets the index in O(log(n)) time. Then, it
   performs another search in B+tree by using the already found index in
   O(log(n)) time and gets the record.

   Each of these nodes in B-tree and B+tree is stored inside the pages. Pages
   are fixed in size. Pages have a unique number starting from one. A page
   can be a reference to another page by using a page number. At the
   beginning of the page, page meta details such as the rightmost child page
   number, first free cell offset and the first cell offset stored. There can
   be two types of pages in a database:

    1. Pages for indexing: These pages store only an index and a reference to
       another page.
    2. Pages to store records: These pages store the actual data and the page
       should be a leaf page.

    

Using SQLite B-Tree Indexing

   The basic syntax to create a B-tree index as follows:

 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;

   There are three kinds of indexing methods used in SQLite.

    

  1. Single Column Index

   Here, indexes are created based on one table column. Only a single B-tree
   is created for indexes. The syntax is as follows.

 CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

    

  2. Unique Index

   Unique indexes aren’t allowed to store duplicate values for the column
   that uses indexing. The syntax can be written as follows:

 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name on table_name (column_name);

    

  3. Composite Index

   This type of index can have multiple indexes. For each of the index
   columns, There exists a Btree. The following is the syntax for composite
   index:

 CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (column1, column2);

Advantages of B-Tree Indexing

   Databases should have an efficient way to store, read, and modify data.
   B-tree provides an efficient way to insert and read data. In actual
   database implementation, the database uses both B-tree and B+tree together
   to store data. B-tree used for indexing and B+tree used to store the
   actual records. B+tree provides sequential search capabilities in addition
   to the binary search, which gives the database more control to search
   non-index values in a database.

   A linden tree has large, spreading branches.Evergreen trees keep their
   needlelike leaves year-round.Trees are tall, woody plants. They usually
   have a stem called a trunk. Trees are some of the largest and oldest
   living things on Earth. Some trees live for hundreds or even thousands of
   years. There are more than 80,000 species, or types, of tree. Well-known
   trees include birches, firs, maples, palms, and pines.

   Plants called conifers have cones that contain the plant's seeds.Some
   trees have flowers in the spring.The Lawson cypress and the English elm
   look different because they are two different types of tree.…Scientists
   divide trees into groups based on how they reproduce. Some trees reproduce
   with spores, or particles that grow into new plants. They are called tree
   ferns. Most trees reproduce with seeds. Some seed-bearing trees grow their
   seeds in cones. They are called conifers. Most seed-bearing trees grow
   their seeds in fruits or pods. They are known as broad-leaved or flowering
   trees.

   Scientists also group trees based on whether they lose their leaves. Trees
   that keep their leaves year-round are called evergreens. Trees that lose
   their leaves during the autumn and winter are called deciduous trees.

    Physical Features

   Coast redwood trees are the tallest trees.Trees are usually more than 10
   feet (3 meters) tall. They have roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves. The
   trunk and branches are made of fibers called wood. These fibers are
   protected by an outer covering called bark. As the tree ages, the trunk
   and branches thicken. In some cases the number of rings in the trunk shows
   the age of the tree.

   The leaves make food for the tree through a process called photosynthesis.
   Veins run through the leaves. They carry water and food to and from the
   branches. Leaves are usually green. The leaves of deciduous trees often
   change colors in autumn before they fall off. New leaves then grow in
   spring.

   Trees are home to many animals, including koalas.Trees are very important
   to people and other animals. Many animals, including some birds, monkeys,
   apes, sloths, frogs, and squirrels live in trees. They also get their food
   from trees, including leaves, nuts, and fruits. For example, koalas spend
   most of their time in eucalyptus trees and eat only eucalyptus leaves.
   People use tree wood to build homes and furniture. Paper is made from wood
   fibers. Many people burn wood to cook and to heat their homes. Farmers
   plant orchards of trees that grow fruit for humans to eat.

   Many people enjoy hiking and playing in parks and forests.Many cities
   plant trees in parks and along streets to make those areas pleasant to
   look at and to spend time in. Forests and parks are places that protect
   trees and other plants for everyone to enjoy.

   Trees also help keep the air clean. They release oxygen for animals,
   including humans, to breathe. They take in the carbon dioxide that animals
   breathe out. Dead twigs and leaves release nutrients into the soil. Tree
   roots help to prevent soil erosion

   Because of the importance of trees, many governments around the world have
   tried to stop people from cutting down trees in the wilderness. But
   deforestation is still a problem in many parts of the world.

   [IMG]A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
   [IMG]It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
   men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
   emanates from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
   spirit. ~ Robert Louis Stevenson [IMG]The earth brought forth vegetation,
   plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit
   in which is their seed, according to its kind. And God saw that it was
   good. ~ Genesis 1:12.

   Trees are plants with elongated stems, or trunks, supporting leaves or
   branches. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always
   been revered and they play a role in much of the world's mythology,
   metaphor and symbolism.

Quotes[edit]

  General[edit]

   [IMG]A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
   leaves; the tree species, in fact,it needs and evolves to fight the moose,
   to keep the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
   twigs. - Robert T. Bakker
     * He who saves an ancient tree does better even than he who plants a new
       one.
          * Alfred Austin, In Veronica's Garden (London: Macmillan and Co.,
            1895), p. 70.
     * A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
       leaves; the tree species, in fact, evolves to fight the moose, to keep
       the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
       twigs. In the final analysis, the merciless hand of natural selection
       will favor the birch genes that make the tree less and less palatable
       to the moose in generation after generation. No plant species could
       survive for long by offering itself as unprotected fodder.
          * Robert T. Bakker, The Dinosaur Heresies: A Revolutionary View of
            Dinosaurs (1986), Longman Scientific @amp; Technical, p. 179.
     * A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
          * William Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790–1793).
     * The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others
       only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see Nature all
       ridicule and deformity, and some scarce see Nature at all. But to the
       eyes of the man of imagination, Nature is Imagination itself.
          * William Blake, The Letters (1799).
     * Lo que soñó la tierra/es visible en el árbol.
          * What the earth dreamt/is written in the tree.
          * The selected poems of Rosario Castellanos (1989)
     * I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to
       live than other things do.
          * Willa Cather, O Pioneers (1913).
     * As by the way of innuendo
       Lucus is made a non lucendo.
          * Charles Churchill, The Ghost (1763), Book II. V. 257. "Lucus a
            non lucendo.—Lucus (a grove), from non lucendo (not admitting
            light)." A derivation given by Quintilian I. 16, and by others.
     * No tree in all the grove but has its charms,
       Though each its hue peculiar.
          * William Cowper, The Task (1785), Book I, line 307.
     * Some boundless contiguity of shade.
          * William Cowper, The Task (1785), Book II.
     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves —
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       *****
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view —
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Pull of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.
          * Dinah Craik, The Mulberry-Tree, reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia
            Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 634.
     * He that planteth a tree is the servant of God,
       He provideth a kindness for many generations,
       And faces that he hath not seen shall bless him.
          * Henry van Dyke, The Friendly Trees.
     * All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All
       these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it
       from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual
       towards freedom.
          * Albert Einstein, in "Moral Decay" (1937); later published in Out
            of My Later Years (1950).
     * Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they
       had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which
       do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three
       years till the new comes.
          * The Book of Enoch ch.3 [1]
     * When iron was found, the trees began to tremble, but the iron
       reassured them: 'Let no handle made from you enter into anything made
       from me, and I shall be powerless to injure you.'
          * Genesis Rabbah 5, Tales and Maxims from the Midrash by Rev.
            Samuel Rapaport, (1907), p. 61
     * If you love me, be patient. Look at the trees. Are they in a hurry to
       ripen their fruit?
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Last Temptation of Christ (1951)
     * The entire Earth, with her trees and her waters, with her animals,
       with her men and her gods, calls from within your breast.
       Earth rises up in your brains and sees her entire body for the first
       time.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "Fourth Step :
            The Earth"
     * Every man has his own circle composed of trees, animals, men, ideas,
       and he is in duty bound to save this circle. He, and no one else. If
       he does not save it, he cannot be saved.
       These are the labors each man is given and is in duty bound to
       complete before he dies. He may not otherwise be saved. For his own
       soul is scattered and enslaved in these things about him, in trees, in
       animals, in men, in ideas, and it is his own soul he saves by
       completing these labors.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "The Action :
            The Relationship between Man and Nature"
     * From the acorn, quickly sprouting,
       Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy, Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,
       Pressed compactly all the grasses, From the ground enriched by ashes,
       That the maidens had been raking, Newly raked by water-maidens;
       When a fire within them kindles, Spread the oak-tree's many branches,
       And the flames shot up to heaven, Rounds itself a broad corona,
       Till the windrows burned to ashes, Raises it above the storm-clouds;
       Only ashes now remaining
       Far it stretches out its branches,
       Of the grasses raked together. Stops the white-clouds in their
       courses,
       In the ashes of the windrows, With its branches hides the sunlight,
       Tender leaves the giant places, With its many leaves, the moonbeams,
       In the leaves he plants an acorn, And the starlight dies in heaven.
          * Kalevala, Rune II. translated by John Martin Crawford (1888). [2]
     * Trees — especially old trees — have a strong and definite
       individuality, well worthy the name of a soul. This soul, though
       temporary, in the sense that it is not yet a reincarnating entity, is
       nevertheless possessed of considerable power and intelligence along
       its own lines. It has decided likes and dislikes, and to clairvoyant
       sight it shows quite clearly by a vivid rosy flush an emphatic
       enjoyment of the sunlight and the rain, and distinct pleasure also in
       the presence of those whom it has learnt to like, or with whom it has
       sympathetic vibrations. Emerson appears to have realised this, for he
       is quoted in Hutton’s Reminiscences as saying of his trees:

           "I am sure they miss me ; they seem to droop when I go away, and I
           know they brighten and bloom when I go back to them and shake
           hands with their lower branches.”

     * Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,
       A sylvan scene, and as the ranks ascend
       Shade above shade, a woody theatre
       Of stateliest view.

     * It's interesting, isn't it? There are many stories about trees giving
       curses (Tatari) in the Western part of Japan. Such folklore, or
       something that goes back to our distant memories, remains strongly in
       Japanese culture. People on Yakushima Island didn't cut the trees.
       They thought that cutting trees would bring about a curse. Trees are
       beings that make us feel that way. I learned it when I went to
       Yakushima. When they decided to cut and sell trees because they were
       too poor to eat, there was a monk who recommended cutting the trees.
       It was not the case that they started cutting tress because a certain
       person happened to be on the island and said so, but rather to do with
       the changes in the society itself.

     * I think that I shall never see
       A billboard lovely as a tree.
       Perhaps, unless the billboards fall,
       I'll never see a tree at all.
          * Ogden Nash, Song of the Open Road (1933).
     * Perhaps you see big trees and little trees and think that big trees
       are older than little trees. You also might notice that there are more
       little trees than big trees, and so not every little tree grows up to
       be a big tree – most die young. But the little trees must come from
       somewhere, namely seeds produced and shed by the bigger trees. These
       are the core ideas of population ecology.

     * Trees perspire profusely, condense largely, and check evaporation so
       much, that woods are always moist: no wonder therefore that they
       contribute much to pools and streams.
       That trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well
       known fact in North-America; for, since the woods and forests have
       been grubbed and cleared, all bodies of water have much diminished; so
       that some streams, that were very considerable a century ago, will not
       now drive a common mill.

    Almond (Prunus dulcis)[edit]

   [IMG]I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God"
   and the almond tree blossomed. ~ Nikos Kazantzakis [IMG]Here was an almond
   tree in bloom before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. ~
   Nikos Kazantzakis
     * I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God."
       and the almond tree blossomed.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Fratricides (1964)
     * I heard the bells from the future churches, the children playing and
       laughing in the schoolyards … and here was an almond tree in bloom
       before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. For, by
       believing passionately in something which still does not exist, we
       create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently
       desired, whatever we have not irrigated with our blood to such a
       degree that it becomes strong enough to stride across the somber
       threshold of nonexistence.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in Report to Greco (1965)

    Ash (Fraxinus)[edit]

     * The ash her purple drops forgivingly
       And sadly, breaking not the general hush;
       The maple swamps glow like a sunset sea,
       Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
       All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze,

    Aspen (Populus Tremuloides)[edit]

     * THE quiet of the evening hour
       Was laid on every summer leaf;
       That purple shade was on each flower,
       At once so beautiful, so brief,
       Only the aspen knew not rest,
       But still, with an unquiet song,
       Kept murmuring to the gentle west,
       And cast a changeful shade along.

            August, 1830, 'The Aspen Tree', also published in The Vow of the

     * What whispers so strange at the hour of midnight,
       From the aspen leaves trembling so wildly?
       Why in the lone wood sings it sad, when the bright
       Full moon beams upon it so mildly?
          * B. S. Ingemann, The Aspen.
     * At that awful hour of the Passion, when the Saviour of the world felt
       deserted in His agony, when—
       "The sympathizing sun his light withdrew,
       And wonder'd how the stars their dying Lord could view"—
       when earth, shaking with horror, rung the passing bell for Deity, and
       universal nature groaned, then from the loftiest tree to the lowliest
       flower all felt a sudden thrill, and trembling, bowed their heads, all
       save the proud and obdurate aspen, which said, "Why should we weep and
       tremble? we trees, and plants, and flowers are pure and never sinned!"
       Ere it ceased to speak, an involuntary trembling seized its very leaf,
       and the word went forth that it should never rest, but tremble on
       until the day of judgment.
          * Legend, from Notes and Queries, first series, Volume VI, No. 161.

    Mulberry Tree (Morus)[edit]

     * Retracing our steps to the garden we see two trees which are redolent
       of the past - a medlar and a mulberry. This last is not a beautiful
       tree. It covers itself with such dense masses of heavy foliage; its
       form has neither grace nor dignity - and yet we love it.

     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves—
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       * * * * *
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view—
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Full of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.

     * Ancient Pines,
       Ye bear no record of the years of man.
       Spring is your sole historian.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.
     * Stately Pines,
       But few more years around the promontory
       Your chant will meet the thunders of the sea.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.

    Poplar (Populus Fastigiata)[edit]

     * We knew it would rain, for the poplars showed
       The white of their leaves, the amber grain
       Shrunk in the wind,—and the lightning now
       Is tangled in tremulous skeins of rain.
          * Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Before the Rain, reported in Hoyt's New
            Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 655.
     * Trees that, like the poplar, hit upward all their boughs, give no
       shade and no shelter, whatever their height. Trees the most lovingly
       shelter and shade us, when, like the willow, the higher soar their
       summits, the lowlier droop their boughs.
          * Edward Bulwer-Lytton, What Will He Do With It? (1858), Book XI,
            Chapter X, introductory lines.

    Tulip-Tree (Liriodendron Tulipifera)[edit]

     * Heed not the night; a summer lodge amid the wild is mine—
       'Tis shadowed by the tulip-tree, 'tis mantled by the vine.
          * William Cullen Bryant, A Strange Lady, Stanza 6; reported in
            Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.
     * The tulip-tree, high up,
       Opened, in airs of June, her multitude
       Of golden chalices to humming birds
       And silken-winged insects of the sky.
          * William Cullen Bryant, The Fountain, Stanza 3; reported in Hoyt's
            New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.

    Umbellularia[edit]

     * The Spice-Tree lives in the garden green,
       Beside it the fountain flows;
       And a fair Bird sits the boughs between,
       And sings his melodious woes.
       * * * * * *
       That out-bound stem has branches three;
       On each a thousand blossoms grow;
       And old as aught of time can be,
       The root stands fast in the rocks below.
          * John Sterling, The Spice-Tree, Stanzas 1 and 3.

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   The abstract data type (ADT) can be represented in a number of ways,
   including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children
   with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of
   parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list).
   Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes
   or ancestor lists for performance.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

Applications[edit]

   Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in
   applications such as:

     * File systems for:
          * Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files
            (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links
            to the same file or directory)
          * The mechanism used to allocate and link blocks of data on the
            storage device
     * Class hierarchy or "inheritance tree" showing the relationships among
       classes in object-oriented programming; multiple inheritance produces
       non-tree graphs
     * Abstract syntax trees for computer languages
     * Natural language processing:
          * Parse trees
          * Modeling utterances in a generative grammar
          * Dialogue tree for generating conversations
     * Document Object Models ("DOM tree") of XML and HTML documents
     * Search trees store data in a way that makes an efficient search
       algorithm possible via tree traversal
          * A binary search tree is a type of binary tree
     * Representing sorted lists of data
     * Computer-generated imagery:
          * Space partitioning, including binary space partitioning
          * Digital compositing
     * Storing Barnes–Hut trees used to simulate galaxies
     * Implementing heaps
     * Nested set collections
     * Hierarchical taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification with
       sections of increasing specificity.
     * Hierarchical temporal memory
     * Genetic programming
     * Hierarchical clustering

   Trees can be used to represent and manipulate various mathematical
   structures, such as:

     * Paths through an arbitrary node-and-edge graph (including
       multigraphs), by making multiple nodes in the tree for each graph node
       used in multiple paths
     * Any mathematical hierarchy

   Tree structures are often used for mapping the relationships between
   things, such as:

     * Components and subcomponents which can be visualized in an
       exploded-view drawing
     * Subroutine calls used to identify which subroutines in a program call
       other subroutines non recursively
     * Inheritance of DNA among species by evolution, of source code by
       software projects (e.g. Linux distribution timeline), of designs in
       various types of cars, etc.
     * The contents of hierarchical namespaces

   JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically
   represented by nested lists and dictionaries.

Terminology[edit]

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
   except the topmost root node, which has none. A node might have many
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Other terms used with trees:

   Neighbor
           Parent or child.

   Ancestor
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

   Descendant
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also
           known as subchild.

   Degree
           For a given node, its number of children. A leaf, by definition,
           has degree zero.

   Degree of tree
           The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node in the tree.

   Distance
           The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.

   Level
           The level of a node is the number of edges along the unique path
           between it and the root node.^[3] This is the same as depth.

   Width
           The number of nodes in a level.

   Breadth
           The number of leaves.

   Forest
           A set of one or more disjoint trees.

   Ordered tree
           A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children
           of each vertex. The book The Art of Computer Programming uses the
           term oriented tree.^[4]

   Size of a tree
           Number of nodes in the tree.

Examples of trees and non-trees[edit]

   [IMG]
   Not a tree: two non-connected parts, A→B and C→D→E. There is more than one
   root.
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: undirected cycle 1-2-4-3. 4 has more than one parent (inbound
   edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle B→C→E→D→B. B has more than one parent (inbound edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle A→A. A is the root but it also has a parent.
   [IMG]
   Each linear list is trivially a tree.

Common operations[edit]

     * Enumerating all the items
     * Enumerating a section of a tree
     * Searching for an item
     * Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
     * Deleting an item
     * Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
     * Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
     * Finding the root for any node
     * Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes

  Traversal and search methods[edit]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
   fixed size, the nodes might be stored in a list. Nodes and relationships
   between nodes might be stored in a separate special type of adjacency
   list. In relational databases, nodes are typically represented as table
   rows, with indexed row IDs facilitating pointers between parents and
   children.

   Nodes can also be stored as items in an array, with relationships between
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of
   the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the
   tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

   Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example
   with natural numbers.^[5]

Type theory[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to   
         remove this template message)                                        

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

           value: T → E
           children: T → F
           nil: () → F
           node: E × F → T

   with the axioms:

           value(node(e, f)) = e
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the
   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

Mathematical terminology[edit]

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
          * which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away
            from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from
            is called the parent and the node that the edge points to is
            called the child), together with:
     * an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in
       graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree – it need not
       include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a
       subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense
       (unless there are no descendants).

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Not to be confused with Trie, a specific type of tree data structure.
   [IMG]This unsorted tree has non-unique values (e.g., the value 2 existing
   in different nodes, not in a single node only) and is non-binary (only up
   to two children nodes per parent node in a binary tree). The root node at
   the top (with the value 2 here), has no parent as it is the highest in the
   tree hierarchy.

   In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that
   represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
   Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the
   type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent,^[1] except for
   the root node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most
   node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or
   "loops" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be
   treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful
   technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many
   trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes
   (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration if they exists)
   in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent
   nodes).

   Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of
   children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is
   specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph
   theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node
   in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children
   nodes.

   The abstract data type (ADT) can be represented in a number of ways,
   including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children
   with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of
   parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list).
   Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes
   or ancestor lists for performance.

   Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from
   mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and
   trees in descriptive set theory.

Applications[edit]

   Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in
   applications such as:

     * File systems for:
          * Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files
            (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links
            to the same file or directory)
          * The mechanism used to allocate and link blocks of data on the
            storage device
     * Class hierarchy or "inheritance tree" showing the relationships among
       classes in object-oriented programming; multiple inheritance produces
       non-tree graphs
     * Abstract syntax trees for computer languages
     * Natural language processing:
          * Parse trees
          * Modeling utterances in a generative grammar
          * Dialogue tree for generating conversations
     * Document Object Models ("DOM tree") of XML and HTML documents
     * Search trees store data in a way that makes an efficient search
       algorithm possible via tree traversal
          * A binary search tree is a type of binary tree
     * Representing sorted lists of data
     * Computer-generated imagery:
          * Space partitioning, including binary space partitioning
          * Digital compositing
     * Storing Barnes–Hut trees used to simulate galaxies
     * Implementing heaps
     * Nested set collections
     * Hierarchical taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification with
       sections of increasing specificity.
     * Hierarchical temporal memory
     * Genetic programming
     * Hierarchical clustering

   Trees can be used to represent and manipulate various mathematical
   structures, such as:

     * Paths through an arbitrary node-and-edge graph (including
       multigraphs), by making multiple nodes in the tree for each graph node
       used in multiple paths
     * Any mathematical hierarchy

   Tree structures are often used for mapping the relationships between
   things, such as:

     * Components and subcomponents which can be visualized in an
       exploded-view drawing
     * Subroutine calls used to identify which subroutines in a program call
       other subroutines non recursively
     * Inheritance of DNA among species by evolution, of source code by
       software projects (e.g. Linux distribution timeline), of designs in
       various types of cars, etc.
     * The contents of hierarchical namespaces

   JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically
   represented by nested lists and dictionaries.

Terminology[edit]

   A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other
   nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or
   more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are
   drawn with descendants going downwards). A node that has a child is called
   the child's parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent,
   except the topmost root node, which has none. A node might have many
   ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same
   parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first
   one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to
   have no nodes at all, in which case it is called empty.

   An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch
   node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external
   node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any
   node that does not have child nodes.

   The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf
   from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The
   depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root
   path). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and
   a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and
   height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such
   are allowed) has height −1.

   Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree,
   which includes that node and all its descendants.^[a]^[2]

   Other terms used with trees:

   Neighbor
           Parent or child.

   Ancestor
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

   Descendant
           A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also
           known as subchild.

   Degree
           For a given node, its number of children. A leaf, by definition,
           has degree zero.

   Degree of tree
           The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node in the tree.

   Distance
           The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.

   Level
           The level of a node is the number of edges along the unique path
           between it and the root node.^[3] This is the same as depth.

   Width
           The number of nodes in a level.

   Breadth
           The number of leaves.

   Forest
           A set of one or more disjoint trees.

   Ordered tree
           A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children
           of each vertex. The book The Art of Computer Programming uses the
           term oriented tree.^[4]

   Size of a tree
           Number of nodes in the tree.

Examples of trees and non-trees[edit]

   [IMG]
   Not a tree: two non-connected parts, A→B and C→D→E. There is more than one
   root.
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: undirected cycle 1-2-4-3. 4 has more than one parent (inbound
   edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle B→C→E→D→B. B has more than one parent (inbound edge).
   [IMG]
   Not a tree: cycle A→A. A is the root but it also has a parent.
   [IMG]
   Each linear list is trivially a tree.

Common operations[edit]

     * Enumerating all the items
     * Enumerating a section of a tree
     * Searching for an item
     * Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
     * Deleting an item
     * Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
     * Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
     * Finding the root for any node
     * Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes

  Traversal and search methods[edit]

   Main article: Tree traversal

   Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between
   parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a walk
   of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives
   at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before
   its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are
   traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a
   post-order walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node
   itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order
   traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left
   subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A
   level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the
   entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root
   node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their
   siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until
   all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

Representations[edit]

   There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes
   are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their
   children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a
   fixed size, the nodes might be stored in a list. Nodes and relationships
   between nodes might be stored in a separate special type of adjacency
   list. In relational databases, nodes are typically represented as table
   rows, with indexed row IDs facilitating pointers between parents and
   children.

   Nodes can also be stored as items in an array, with relationships between
   them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

   A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list
   (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail
   (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree).
   This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions,
   where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of
   the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the
   tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

   Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example
   with natural numbers.^[5]

Type theory[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to

   As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type T with values of some
   type E is defined, using the abstract forest type F (list of trees), by
   the functions:

           value: T → E
           children: T → F
           nil: () → F
           node: E × F → T

   with the axioms:

           value(node(e, f)) = e
           children(node(e, f)) = f

   In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the
   constructors nil (empty forest) and node (tree with root node with given
   value and children).

Mathematical terminology[edit]

         This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this     
   [IMG] section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material  
         may be challenged and removed. (April 2022) (Learn how and when to   
         remove this template message)                                        

   Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally
   with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be
   non-empty):

     * A rooted tree with the "away from root" direction (a more narrow term
       is an "arborescence"), meaning:
          * A directed graph,
          * whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are
            connected by exactly one simple path),
          * with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
          * which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away
            from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from
            is called the parent and the node that the edge points to is
            called the child), together with:
     * an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and
     * a value (of some data type) at each node.

   Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor
   (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty,
   hence at most two non-empty child nodes), hence a "binary tree".

   Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more
   complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are
   allowed the above definition instead becomes "an empty tree or a rooted
   tree such that ...". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining
   fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree
   such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree
   (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include
   the fork operation.^[clarification needed]

Notes[edit]

    1. ^ This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in
       graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree – it need not
       include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a
       subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense
       (unless there are no descendants).

     A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to
     represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and
     search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has
     a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

     The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it
     are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and
     these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a
     recursive structure.

   This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in
   the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node,
   structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can
   also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves
   connected with one another.

Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:

     * Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the
       parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.
     * Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is
       called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child
       nodes of {B}.
     * Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have
       any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the
       tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly
       one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
     * Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child
       nodes are called leaf nodes. {K, L, M, N, O, P, G} are the leaf nodes
       of the tree.
     * Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to
       that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor
       nodes of the node {E}
     * Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that
       node. {E,I} are the descendants of the node {B}.
     * Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E}
       are called siblings.
     * Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to
       that node. The root node has level 0.
     * Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
     * Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called
       neighbors of that node.
     * Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.

Representation of Tree Data Structure:

     A tree consists of a root, and zero or more subtrees T_1, T_2, … , T_k
     such that there is an edge from the root of the tree to the root of each
     subtree.

  Representation of a Node in Tree Data Structure:

     struct Node
     {
        int data;
        struct Node *first_child;
        struct Node *second_child;
        struct Node *third_child;
        .
        .
        .
        struct Node *nth_child;
     };

  Example of Tree data structure

    

   Here,

     * Node 1 is the root node
     * 1 is the parent of 2 and 3
     * 2 and 3 are the siblings
     * 4, 5, 6, and 7 are the leaf nodes
     * 1 and 2 are the ancestors of 5

Types of Tree data structures:

   Types of Trees in Data Structure based on the number of children

     * Binary tree: In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two
       children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full
       binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and
       degenerate or pathological binary trees.
     * Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each
       node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”,
       “mid” and “right”.
     * N-ary Tree or Generic Tree: Generic trees are a collection of nodes
       where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a
       list of references to its children(duplicate references are not
       allowed). Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of
       multiple nodes.

Basic Operation Of Tree Data Structure:

     * Create – create a tree in the data structure.
     * Insert − Inserts data in a tree.
     * Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is
       present or not.
     * Traversal:
          * Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order
            manner in the data structure.
          * In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order
            manner.
          * Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order
            manner.

Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?

   The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e., they are
   not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or we
   can say it is a hierarchical structure. For this reason, the tree is
   considered to be a non-linear data structure.

Properties of Tree Data Structure:

     * Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two
       nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is
       only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.
     * Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the
       path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to
       the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the
       path from the root of the tree to the node.
     * Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of
       the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest
       path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
     * Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is
       called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0.
       The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the
       nodes in the tree.

Need for Tree Data Structure

   1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information
   that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a
   computer: 

   File System

   2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search
   (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
   3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and
   slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
   4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on
   the number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

Application of Tree Data Structure:

     * File System:  This allows for efficient navigation and organization of
       files.
     * Data Compression: Huffman coding is a popular technique for data
       compression that involves constructing a binary tree where the leaves
       represent characters and their frequency of occurrence. The resulting
       tree is used to encode the data in a way that minimizes the amount of
       storage required.
     * Compiler Design: In compiler design, a syntax tree is used to
       represent the structure of a program. 
     * Database Indexing: B-trees and other tree structures are used in
       database indexing to efficiently search for and retrieve data.

   article.

Advantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Tree offer Efficient Searching Depending on the type of tree, with
       average search times of O(log n) for balanced trees like AVL. 
     * Trees provide a hierarchical representation of data, making it easy to
       organize and navigate large amounts of information.
     * The recursive nature of trees makes them easy to traverse and
       manipulate using recursive algorithms.

   To learn more about the advantages of Tree Data Structure, refer to this
   article.

Disadvantages of Tree Data Structure:

     * Unbalanced Trees, meaning that the height of the tree is skewed
       towards one side, which can lead to inefficient search times.
     * Trees demand more memory space requirements than some other data
       structures like arrays and linked lists, especially if the tree is
       very large.
     * The implementation and manipulation of trees can be complex and
       require a good understanding of the algorithms.

   In mathematics, Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees
   over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under
   homeomorphic embedding.

History[edit]

   The theorem was conjectured by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved by Joseph
   Kruskal (1960); a short proof was given by Crispin Nash-Williams (1963).
   It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a
   statement that cannot be proved in ATR_0 (a second-order arithmetic theory
   with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion).

   In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the
   Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in
   reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function
   which dwarfs TREE(3). A finitary application of the theorem gives the
   existence of the fast-growing TREE function.

Statement[edit]

   The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's
   formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

   Given a tree T with a root, and given vertices v, w, call w a successor of
   v if the unique path from the root to w contains v, and call w an
   immediate successor of v if additionally the path from v to w contains no
   other vertex.

   Take X to be a partially ordered set. If T_1, T_2 are rooted trees with
   vertices labeled in X, we say that T_1 is inf-embeddable in T_2 and write
   T_1 ≤ T_2 if there is an injective map F from the vertices of T_1 to the
   vertices of T_2 such that

     * For all vertices v of T_1, the label of v precedes the label of F(v),
     * If w is any successor of v in T_1, then F(w) is a successor of F(v),
       and
     * If w_1, w_2 are any two distinct immediate successors of v, then the
       path from F(w_1) to F(w_2) in T_2 contains F(v).

   Kruskal's tree theorem then states:

     If X is well-quasi-ordered, then the set of rooted trees with labels in
     X is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above.
     (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T_1, T_2, … of rooted trees
     labeled in X, there is some i @lt; j so that T_i ≤ T_j.)

Friedman's work[edit]

   For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and
   proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or
   the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the
   theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much
   weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first
   observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the
   then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees
   above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has size
   one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR_0,^[1] thus
   giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably
   impredicative proof.^[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0, but by adding a "gap condition"^[3] to the definition of the
   order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem
   unprovable in this system.^[4]^[5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour
   theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0.

   Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the
   proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal
   (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).^[citation needed]

Weak tree function[edit]

   Suppose that P(n) is the statement:

           There is some m such that if T_1, ..., T_m is a finite sequence of
           unlabeled rooted trees where T_i has i + n vertices, then
           T_i ≤ T_j for some i @lt; j.

   All the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and
   Kőnig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true,
   but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement "P(n) is true for all
   n".^[6] Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano
   arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n, far faster than any
   primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for
   example.^[citation needed] The least m for which P(n) holds similarly
   grows extremely quickly with n.

   Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have
   the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of unlabeled rooted trees, where
           each T_i has at most i + n vertices, such that T_i ≤ T_j does not
           hold for any i @lt; j ≤ m.

   It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960,
   tree(4) @gt; Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument
   specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than {\displaystyle
   \mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree}
   ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{8}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7).}

   To differentiate the two functions, "TREE" with all letters capitalized is
   the big TREE function and "tree" with all letters in lowercase is the weak
   tree function.

TREE function[edit]

   Sequence of trees where each node is colored either green, red, blueA
   sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue @lt; red @lt;
   green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no
   tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is
   defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

   By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing
   function.^[7] For a positive integer n, take TREE(n)^[a] to be the largest
   m so that we have the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of rooted trees labelled from a
           set of n labels, where each T_i has at most i vertices, such that
           T_i ≤ T_j does not hold for any i @lt; j ≤ m.

   The TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3)
   explodes to a value that is so big that many other "large" combinatorial
   constants, such as Friedman's n(4), n^n(5)(5), and Graham's number,^[b]
   are extremely small by comparison. A lower bound for n(4), and hence an
   extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is A^A(187196)(1).^[c]^[8]
   Graham's number, for example, is much smaller than the lower bound
   A^A(187196)(1). It is approximately {\displaystyle g_{3\uparrow
   ^{187196}3}}, where g_x is Graham's function.

                              Tree Data Structure                             
                                                                              
   We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and   
   queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The   
   different data structures are used for different kinds of data.            
                                                                              
   Some factors are considered for choosing the data structure:               
                                                                              
     * What type of data needs to be stored?: It might be a possibility that  
       a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data.    
     * Cost of operations: If we want to minimize the cost for the operations 
       for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a   
       simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we 
       can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to    
       perform the binary search. The binary search works very fast for the   
       simple list as it divides the search space into half.                  
     * Memory usage: Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less   
       memory.                                                                
                                                                              
   A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical      
   data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the     
   hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:               
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above tree shows the organization hierarchy of some company. In the    
   above structure, john is the CEO of the company, and John has two direct   
   reports named as Steve and Rohan. Steve has three direct reports named     
   Lee, Bob, Ella where Steve is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named  
   Sal and Emma. Emma has two direct reports named Tom and Raj. Tom has one   
   direct report named Bill. This particular logical structure is known as a  
   Tree. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a Tree. In 
   this structure, the root is at the top, and its branches are moving in a   
   downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is  
   an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.                
                                                                              
   Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.               
                                                                              
     * A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or         
       entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or       
       simulate hierarchy.                                                    
     * A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does   
       not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as    
       elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.                    
     * In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node.  
       Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the      
       above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so   
       the type of data would be a string.                                    
     * Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes  
       that can be called children.                                           
                                                                              
   Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.                              
                                                                              
   Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:                   
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   In the above structure, each node is labeled with some number. Each arrow  
   shown in the above figure is known as a link between the two nodes.        
                                                                              
     * Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In      
       other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In 
       the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If  
       a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a     
       parent-child relationship.                                             
     * Child node: If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is  
       known as a child node.                                                 
     * Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to   
       be the parent of that sub-node.                                        
     * Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.    
     * Leaf Node:- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node,   
       is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the      
       tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. 
       Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.                          
     * Internal nodes: A node has atleast one child node known as an internal 
     * Ancestor node:- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a     
       path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any        
       ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are 
       the ancestors of node 10.                                              
     * Descendant: The immediate successor of the given node is known as a    
       descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of     
       node 5.                                                                
                                                                              
     Properties of Tree data structure                                        
                                                                              
     * Recursive data structure: The tree is also known as a recursive data   
       structure. A tree can be defined as recursively because the            
       distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a root node.   
       The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its      
       subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below   
       figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left      
       subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different    
       colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner.   
       So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented  
       in various applications.                                               
       Tree                                                                   
     * Number of edges: If there are n nodes, then there would n-1 edges.     
       Each arrow in the structure represents the link or path. Each node,    
       except the root node, will have atleast one incoming link known as an  
       edge. There would be one link for the parent-child relationship.       
     * Depth of node x: The depth of node x can be defined as the length of   
       the path from the root to the node x. One edge contributes one-unit    
       length in the path. So, the depth of node x can also be defined as the 
       number of edges between the root node and the node x. The root node    
       has 0 depth.                                                           
     * Height of node x: The height of node x can be defined as the longest   
       path from the node x to the leaf node.                                 
                                                                              
   Based on the properties of the Tree data structure, trees are classified   
   into various categories.                                                   
                                                                              
     Implementation of Tree                                                   
                                                                              
   The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically   
   with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented   
   as shown below:                                                            
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in    
   the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The    
   second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the    
   left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.     
                                                                              
   In programming, the structure of a node can be defined as:                 
                                                                              
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
                                                                              
   The above structure can only be defined for the binary trees because the   
   binary tree can have utmost two children, and generic trees can have more  
   than two children. The structure of the node for generic trees would be    
   different as compared to the binary tree.                                  
                                                                              
     Applications of trees                                                    
                                                                              
   The following are the applications of trees:                               
                                                                              
     * Storing naturally hierarchical data: Trees are used to store the data  
       in the hierarchical structure. For example, the file system. The file  
       system stored on the disc drive, the file and folder are in the form   
       of the naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees.    
     * Organize data: It is used to organize data for efficient insertion,    
       deletion and searching. For example, a binary tree has a logN time for 
       searching an element.                                                  
     * Trie: It is a special kind of tree that is used to store the           
       dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking. 
     * Heap: It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is 
       used to implement priority queues.                                     
     * B-Tree and B+Tree: B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used 
       to implement indexing in databases.                                    
     * Routing table: The tree data structure is also used to store the data  
       in routing tables in the routers.                                      
                                                                              
     Types of Tree data structure                                             
                                                                              
   The following are the types of a tree data structure:                      
                                                                              
     * General tree: The general tree is one of the types of tree data        
       structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n  
       number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the  
       node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node   
       in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent  
       node are known as subtrees.                                            
       Tree                                                                   
       There can be n number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general    
       tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be 
       ordered.                                                               
       Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are          
       connected to the nodes known as child nodes. The root node is labeled  
       with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as         
       siblings.                                                              
     * Binary tree: Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0    
       and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child 
       nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2    
       nodes.                                                                 
       Tree

     * Binary Search tree: Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure  
       in which one node is connected to n number of nodes. It is a           
       node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary       
       search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and        
       right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in  
       a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child    
       and right child pointer).                                              
       Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the      
       value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right        
       subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.                
                                                                              
   A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as   
   struct, as shown below:

   The above is the node structure with three fields: data field, the second  
   field is the left pointer of the node type, and the third field is the     
   right pointer of the node type.

     * AVL tree                                                               
                                                                              
   It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a      
   variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the  
   binary tree as well as of the binary search tree. It is a self-balancing   
   binary search tree that was invented by Adelson Velsky Lindas. Here,       
   self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right  
   subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the balancing factor.      
                                                                              
   We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search  
   tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as 
   the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of    
   the right subtree. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or   
   1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the       
   balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.                                    
                                                                              
   To know more about the AVL tree, click on the link given below:            
                                                                              
   https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree                                        
                                                                              
     * Red-Black Tree                                                         
                                                                              
   The red-Black tree is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the      
   Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a   
   binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the  
   value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater   
   than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary 
   search in the average case is log_2n, the best case is O(1), and the worst 
   case is O(n).                                                              
                                                                              
   When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be        
   balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion,   
   etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time          
   complexity of log_2n.                                                      
                                                                              
   The red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is     
   also a height balancing binary search tree then why do we require a        
   Red-Black tree. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would   
   be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 
   rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that 
   represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing 
   of the tree.                                                               
                                                                              
     * Splay tree                                                             
                                                                              
   The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently 
   accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some 
   rotation operations. Here, splaying means the recently accessed node. It   
   is a self-balancing binary search tree having no explicit balance          
   condition like AVL tree.                                                   
                                                                              
   It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced,   
   i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the           
   operations in splay tree takes order of logN time where n is the number of 
   nodes.                                                                     
                                                                              
   Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height      
   balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which    
   leads to a balanced tree.                                                  
                                                                              
     * Treap                                                                  
                                                                              
   Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it    
   comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary  
   search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the  
   value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or 
   greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both      
   right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we   
   can say that the root node contains the lowest value.                      
                                                                              
   In treap data structure, each node has both key and priority where key is  
   derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap  
   data structure.                                                            
                                                                              
   The Treap data structure follows two properties which are given below:     
                                                                              
     * Right child of a node@gt;=current node and left child of a node @lt;=current 
       node (binary tree)                                                     
     * Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap)           
     * B-tree                                                                 
                                                                              
   B-tree is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree.     
   Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have  
   more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the       
   sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at      
   different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same    
   level.                                                                     
                                                                              
   If order is m then node has the following properties:                      
                                                                              
     * Each node in a b-tree can have maximum m children                      
     * For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has        
       minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2        
       children. For example, the value of m is 5 which means that a node can 
       have 5 children and internal nodes can contain maximum 3 children.     
     * Each node has maximum (m-1) keys.                                      
                                                                              
   The root node must contain minimum 1 key and all other nodes must contain  
   atleast ceiling of m/2 minus 1 keys.

   In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices
   are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
   undirected graph.^[1] A forest is an undirected graph in which any two
   vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic
   undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.^[2]

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented
   forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a
   forest.

   The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer
   science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although
   such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be
   directed, called a directed rooted tree,^[8]^[9] either making all its
   edges point away from the root—in which case it is called an
   arborescence^[4]^[10] or out-tree^[11]^[12]—or making all its edges point
   towards the root—in which case it is called an anti-arborescence^[13] or
   in-tree.^[11]^[14] A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors
   as a directed graph.^[15]^[16]^[17] A rooted forest is a disjoint union of
   rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted
   forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each
   rooted tree—in which case it is called a branching or out-forest—or making
   all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree—in which case it
   is called an anti-branching or in-forest.

   The term tree was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur
   Cayley.^[18]

Definitions[edit]

  Tree[edit]

   A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following
   equivalent conditions:

     * G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
     * G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
     * G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is
       removed from G.
     * G is connected and the complete graph K_3 is not a minor of G.
     * Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.

   If G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements
   are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:

     * G is connected and has n − 1 edges.
     * G is connected, and every subgraph of G includes at least one vertex
       with zero or one incident edges. (That is, G is connected and
       1-degenerate.)
     * G has no simple cycles and has n − 1 edges.

   As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no
   vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously
   connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is
   not 0-connected (or even (−1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike
   non-empty trees, and violates the "one more vertex than edges" relation.
   It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.

   An internal vertex (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2.
   Similarly, an external vertex (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf)
   is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree
   at least 3.^[19]

   An irreducible tree (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is
   no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence A000014 in the OEIS).^[20]

  Forest[edit]

   A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
   at most one path. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected acyclic graph,
   all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph
   consists of a disjoint union of trees. As special cases, the order-zero
   graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless
   graph, are examples of forests. Since for every tree V − E = 1, we can
   easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting
   the difference between total vertices and total edges. TV − TE = number of
   trees in a forest.

  Polytree[edit]

   Main article: Polytree

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed
   edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both
   connected and acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed tree" to the case where
   the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed
   away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).

  Polyforest[edit]

   A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic
   graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest. In other words, if we
   replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected
   graph that is acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed forest" to the case
   where the edges of each connected component are all directed towards a
   particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see
   branching).

  Rooted tree[edit]

   A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the
   root.^[21] The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural
   orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the
   structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has
   an orientation away from the root, it is called an arborescence^[4] or
   out-tree;^[11] when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called
   an anti-arborescence or in-tree.^[11] The tree-order is the partial
   ordering on the vertices of a tree with u @lt; v if and only if the unique
   path from the root to v passes through u. A rooted tree T that is a
   subgraph of some graph G is a normal tree if the ends of every T-path in G
   are comparable in this tree-order (Diestel 2005, p. 15). Rooted trees,
   often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at
   each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data
   structure.

   In a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any
   designated root is called a free tree.

   A labeled tree is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The
   vertices of a labeled tree on n vertices (for nonnegative integers n) are
   typically given the labels 1, 2, …, n. A recursive tree is a labeled
   rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if u @lt; v
   for two vertices u and v, then the label of u is smaller than the label of
   v).

   In a rooted tree, the parent of a vertex v is the vertex connected to v on
   the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root
   has no parent.^[21] A child of a vertex v is a vertex of which v is the
   parent.^[21] An ascendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either the
   parent of v or is (recursively) an ascendant of a parent of v. A
   descendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either a child of v or is
   (recursively) a descendant of a child of v. A sibling to a vertex v is any
   other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with v.^[21] A leaf is a
   vertex with no children.^[21] An internal vertex is a vertex that is not a
   leaf.^[21]

   The height of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest
   downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The height of the tree is the
   height of the root. The depth of a vertex is the length of the path to its
   root (root path). This^[clarification needed (This ___?)] is commonly
   needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees
   in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a
   tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has
   depth^[clarification needed (we've only defined depth of a vertex, not
   also the depth of the tree)] and height zero. Conventionally, an empty
   tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height
   −1.

   A k-ary tree (for nonnegative integers k) is a rooted tree in which each
   vertex has at most k children.^[22] 2-ary trees are often called binary
   trees, while 3-ary trees are sometimes called ternary trees.

  Ordered tree[edit]

   An ordered tree (alternatively, plane tree or positional tree^[23]) is a
   rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each
   vertex.^[21]^[24] This is called a "plane tree" because an ordering of the
   children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the
   root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex.
   Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction
   of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the
   children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing
   the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be
   drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.

Properties[edit]

     * Every tree is a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if
       it contains no cycles of odd length. Since a tree contains no cycles
       at all, it is bipartite.
     * Every tree with only countably many vertices is a planar graph.
     * Every connected graph G admits a spanning tree, which is a tree that
       contains every vertex of G and whose edges are edges of G. More
       specific types spanning trees, existing in every connected finite
       graph, include depth-first search trees and breadth-first search
       trees. Generalizing the existence of depth-first-search trees, every
       connected graph with only countably many vertices has a Trémaux
       tree.^[25] However, some uncountable-order graphs do not have such a
       tree.^[26]
     * Every finite tree with n vertices, with n @gt; 1, has at least two
       terminal vertices (leaves). This minimal number of leaves is
       characteristic of path graphs; the maximal number, n − 1, is attained
       only by star graphs. The number of leaves is at least the maximum
       vertex degree.
     * For any three vertices in a tree, the three paths between them have
       exactly one vertex in common. More generally, a vertex in a graph that
       belongs to three shortest paths among three vertices is called a
       median of these vertices. Because every three vertices in a tree have
       a unique median, every tree is a median graph.
     * Every tree has a center consisting of one vertex or two adjacent
       vertices. The center is the middle vertex or middle two vertices in
       every longest path. Similarly, every n-vertex tree has a centroid
       consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. In the first case
       removal of the vertex splits the tree into subtrees of fewer than n/2
       vertices. In the second case, removal of the edge between the two
       centroidal vertices splits the tree into two subtrees of exactly n/2
       vertices.
     * The maximal cliques of a tree are precisely its edges, implying that
       the class of trees has few cliques.

Enumeration[edit]

  Labeled trees[edit]

   Cayley's formula states that there are n^n−2 trees on n labeled vertices.
   A classic proof uses Prüfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger
   result: the number of trees with vertices 1, 2, …, n of degrees d_1, d_2,
   …, d_n respectively, is the multinomial coefficient

           {\displaystyle {n-2 \choose d_{1}-1,d_{2}-1,\ldots ,d_{n}-1}.}

   A more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph,
   which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem. (Cayley's formula is the
   special case of spanning trees in a complete graph.) The similar problem
   of counting all the subtrees regardless of size is #P-complete in the
   general case (Jerrum (1994)).

  Unlabeled trees[edit]

   Counting the number of unlabeled free trees is a harder problem. No closed
   formula for the number t(n) of trees with n vertices up to graph
   isomorphism is known. The first few values of t(n) are

           1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, …
           (sequence A000055 in the OEIS).

   Otter (1948) proved the asymptotic estimate

           {\displaystyle t(n)\sim C\alpha ^{n}n^{-5/2}\quad {\text{as }}n\to
           \infty ,}

   with C ≈ 0.534949606... and α ≈ 2.95576528565... (sequence A051491 in the
   OEIS). Here, the ~ symbol means that

           {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {t(n)}{C\alpha
           ^{n}n^{-5/2}}}=1.}

   This is a consequence of his asymptotic estimate for the number r(n) of
   unlabeled rooted trees with n vertices:

           r(n) \sim D\alpha^n n^{-3/2} \quad\text{as } n\to\infty,

   with D ≈ 0.43992401257... and the same α as above (cf. Knuth (1997), chap.
   2.3.4.4 and Flajolet @amp; Sedgewick (2009), chap. VII.5, p. 475).

   The first few values of r(n) are^[27]

           1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, 12486, 32973, …
           (sequence A000081 in the OEIS).

Types of trees[edit]

     * A path graph (or linear graph) consists of n vertices arranged in a
       line, so that vertices i and i + 1 are connected by an edge for i = 1,
       …, n – 1.
     * A starlike tree consists of a central vertex called root and several
       path graphs attached to it. More formally, a tree is starlike if it
       has exactly one vertex of degree greater than 2.
     * A star tree is a tree which consists of a single internal vertex (and
       n – 1 leaves). In other words, a star tree of order n is a tree of
       order n with as many leaves as possible.
     * A caterpillar tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance
       1 of a central path subgraph.
     * A lobster tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 2
       of a central path subgraph.
     * A regular tree of degree d is the infinite tree with d edges at each
       vertex. These arise as the Cayley graphs of free groups, and in the
       theory of Tits buildings.

       on pages 20–21. Also in 1847, the German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff
       investigated electrical circuits and found a relation between the
       number (n) of wires/resistors (branches), the number (m) of junctions
       (vertices), and the number (μ) of loops (faces) in the circuit. He

   “Louisiana celebrates Arbor Day each year on the third Friday of January.
   It’s during the cooler months that’s the best time of year to plant a
   tree,” said C.A. “Buck” Vandersteen, executive director of the Louisiana
   Forestry Association. “We’re always happy to see the community come out
   and get a tree. Many plant them with a child or grandchild.”

   ArborGen SuperTree Nursery provides the seedlings each year. Also,
   saplings will be available, complements of Louisiana Forest Seed.

   The Louisiana Forestry Association is a group of 4,000 members that
   includes forest landowners, foresters, loggers and others employed in the
   forest products industry. LFA’s mission is to further the practice of
   sustainable forestry.

   Gulfport bonfire

   St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, hosts a Christmas
   tree bonfire for Epiphany each year on a beach near where the former
   church building stood until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

   [Episcopal News Service] The Christian holy day Epiphany, on Jan. 6, is
   also known as the “Feast of Lights,” and some Episcopal congregations
   celebrate this feast quite literally, by burning Christmas trees and
   greens in recognition of Jesus as a light to the world.

   “If you’ve ever seen Christmas trees burn … they go up in a tremendous
   blaze,” the Rev. Hillary Raining told Episcopal News Service in describing
   the annual Epiphany bonfire at St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in
   Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, where she is rector.

   A similar blaze is planned at All Saints’ Episcopal Church in
   Russellville, Arkansas. The fire, a mix of Christmas trees and ordinary
   firewood, will be followed by a short liturgy and blessing of kits of
   chalk that attendees can use to mark their front doors with the initials
   of the Magi, another beloved Epiphany tradition.

   “It’s something that allows us again to remind folks that the church is in
   the world and not just in the church building,” the Rev. Mercedes
   Clements, rector at All Saints’, told ENS.

   And at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, the
   congregation will continue a local Epiphany tradition dating back more
   than 50 years when it hosts a Christmas tree bonfire on a nearby beach.
   The Epiphany bonfire has taken on greater meaning to the St. Mark’s
   congregation in the years since Hurricane Katrina destroyed the former
   church in 2005.

   “We celebrate in prayers of hope and gratefulness for the New Year, then
   enjoy hot chocolate and the first King Cakes of the year,” the church says
   on its website.

   The light from a Christmas tree fire invokes symbolism partly rooted in
   Epiphany’s origins as an alternative to pagan festivals that were held on
   the winter solstice – the darkest day of the year. Also known as Three
   Kings Day, Epiphany traditionally commemorates the day the Magi were
   introduced to the infant Jesus. Light also is a familiar motif in
   contemporary lectionary readings for Epiphany, such as Isaiah 60:1-6:
   “Arise, shine; for your light has come.”

   Some of the clergy interviewed by ENS emphasized that the purpose is not
   to demonize darkness but to celebrate Jesus’ earthly role.

   “It is not a good-bad binary. Darkness is not the representation of bad or
   evil. It’s just a contrast,” said the Very Rev. Steven Thomason, dean of
   St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, Washington. “The spiritual
   journey includes both, and can honor both.”

   St. Mark’s will hold its Epiphany festivities after sundown Jan. 5,
   starting with Holy Eucharist in the cathedral. Worshippers then will
   proceed out to the parking lot, where Advent wreaths and other Christmas
   greens will be burned in a fire pit. Dozens usually attend, sipping hot
   chocolate and apple cider around a modest blaze.

   “It’s still a nice fire to warm by and to have the brightness of the
   light,” Thomason said. “It’s a great source of joy for folks in the middle
   of winter.”

   At All Saints’, the church in Arkansas, the bonfire is scheduled for the
   evening Jan. 6. Clements will lead an adaptation of Evening Prayer as
   worshipers gather outdoors around the burning trees. The church is located
   on a wooded property, so the congregation will keep the blaze small for
   safety, Clements said, while still “bringing some light into the darkness,
   and reminding us that Jesus does that in our lives.”

   Raining, the rector at St. Christopher’s in suburban Philadelphia, noted
   that Christmas tree burns have ancient roots in Twelfth Night
   celebrations, which marked the end of the Christmas season. And though
   burning trees may not seem like the most environmentally friendly
   practice, Raining said it is preferable to leaving trees on the curb for
   disposal in a landfill. Also, the ashes from the fire will be used to
   fertilize the grounds of the church.

   St. Christopher’s will host its Christmas tree bonfire in the evening Jan.
   7, with the public invited to bring trees and greens from home. Past
   bonfires have been community events, attracting some residents who don’t
   normally attend the church. The church also invites the local fire
   department, both as a safety precaution and so Raining can bless the fire
   truck.

   “We really consider this part of our pastoring the community,” Raining
   said. “There’s something about gathering in what in the Northern
   Hemisphere are the darkest of nights and being able to talk about Jesus.”

   Attendees also are encouraged to identify things they wish to let go of in
   the new year and write them on slips of paper. The slips then are tossed
   into the fire and sent up, like prayers.

                                What is a Tree?

   by Michael Kuhns, Extension Forestry Specialist

   What is a tree? How are trees different from grasses, sunflowers,
   dandelions, and other types of plants? And what do trees have in common
   with shrubs and woody vines? The answers to these questions seem obvious
   at first. But unless you are a botanist you may find that the answers
   don't come easily. Let's look a little closer to find some common
   characteristics of trees, shrubs, and woody vines.

   Trees, shrubs, and vines belong to many different plant families. Some are
   closely related, like ponderosa pine and limber pine. Others are not
   closely related at all, like eastern red cedar and silver maple. However,
   trees, shrubs, and vines all have one thing that separates them from the
   rest of the plant world: a woody stem that is perennial or that lives for
   many years. Grasses and certain other plants may be perennial, but their
   tops are regrown year after year from rhizomes, bulbs, or other organs
   found at or just under the soil surface.

   Let's look at each of the parts of a woody plant's stem and see how they
   are put together and how they grow larger year after year. If you could
   tunnel into a woody plant's stem, whether the trunk of a tree or a twig on
   a shrub, you would first encounter bark, then cambium, and finally wood or
   xylem. Bark is the outer covering on the trunk, twigs, and woody roots.
   The outer bark we are familiar with is a layer of dead corky cells
   protecting the rest of the stem. The inner bark, or phloem, is a live
   spongy layer just inside the outer bark that moves sugars and other
   substances from the leaves to the stem, roots, and other places where they
   are needed. Inner bark eventually grows out to form part of the outer
   bark.

   New bark is constantly being made on the inside and pushed out. This is
   why older trunks usually have rough outer bark that peels or flakes away.
   Bark is highly variable, though. Young trees of most species have fairly
   smooth bark. To see what a tree's bark looked like when it was young, look
   at the young bark on upper branches and twigs.

   White Oak Cross section

   Cross section of white oak tree trunk:

   (A) outer bark (dry dead tissue)
   (B) inner bark (living tissue)
   (C) cambium
   (D) sapwood
   (E) heartwood
   (F) pith
   (G) wood rays.

   Just inside the bark, but outside the wood, is a single layer of cells
   called the cambium. This layer repeatedly divides, first in then out, to
   form all of the new wood and bark. Wood, or xylem, makes up everything
   inside the cambium on tree trunks, branches, twigs, and woody roots. Wood
   is made up of fibers for strength and hollow tubes of different sizes.
   These tubes are like straws that conduct water from the roots to the
   leaves. These tubes and fibers, as well as other types of cells, are
   packed tightly together to make the wood inside a woody plant.

   As woody plants grow in diameter a new layer of wood is produced each year
   by the cambium. This layer is called an annual ring or growth ring. The
   rings in the center of a trunk or twig are the oldest and those near the
   outside are younger. Wide rings usually indicate good growth conditions
   for that year and narrow rings indicate poor growing conditions.

   As a stem ages and grows, eventually some of the wood in the center is not
   needed for water movement. This wood dies one ring at a time and becomes
   heartwood. Heartwood often is filled with dark colored substances that
   help it resist decay, as in red cedar's red to purple heartwood. The
   active living wood on the outside of the stem, one to many rings wide, is
   called the sapwood. It is usually lighter in color than heartwood. Sapwood
   is responsible for all water and mineral movement through the stem.

   Ponderosa PineMost people would agree that this ponderosa pine is a tree,
   but...

   Canyon Maple tree...the canyon maple and Utah junipers in this picture
   might be considered shrubs. Given enough time to grow, all of them should
   meet the definition of a tree.

   So trees, shrubs, and woody vines all have woody, perennial stems. What
   makes them different from one another? The distinction between trees and
   shrubs is not always clear. We all know that a large cottonwood is a tree
   and a creeping juniper is a shrub, but there are many shrub-like trees and
   tree-like shrubs. Though no scientific definition exists to separate trees
   and shrubs, a useful definition for a tree is a woody plant having one
   erect perennial stem (trunk) at least three inches in diameter at a point
   4-1/2 feet above the ground, a definitely formed crown of foliage, and a
   mature height of at least 13 feet. This definition works fine, though some
   trees may have more than one stem and young trees obviously don't meet the
   size criteria. A shrub can then be defined as a woody plant with several
   perennial stems that may be erect or may lay close to the ground. It will
   usually have a height less than 13 feet and stems no more than about three
   inches in diameter.

   Woody vines are plants that have perennial stems that cannot support
   themselves. Vines use other plants or objects to rise above the ground or
   they lie along the ground. Vines attach themselves to other objects with
   tendrils or by twining. Though woody vines have perennial stems, these
   stems rarely get very large in diameter.

   Trees, shrubs, and woody vines can be classified as deciduous or
   evergreen. If a plant's leaves stay green and alive through the winter it
   is called an evergreen. Examples found in Utah are pines, spruces, and
   junipers. Plants whose leaves die in autumn and fall off, such as elms,
   maples, and ashes, are called deciduous. In Utah nearly all evergreen
   woody plants have needle-like or scaly leaves and most deciduous woody
   plants have broad leaves. All vines commonly found in Utah have broad
   leaves and are deciduous.

                                     Gavin Scott, 47, of Colorado Springs
                                     died around noon Tuesday, the Summit
                                     County Coroner’s Office said in an email

            Tree Trimming, Removal Project To Slow Traffic On US 97A

   Motorists in the Chelan area will encounter the unusual sight of orange on
   the roadway in the wintertime next week.

   The Washington State Department of Transportation (DOT) is partnering with
   the Chelan County PUD for a tree thinning and removal project on U.S.
   Highway 97A just west of the Dan Gordon Bridge.

   "We will be providing traffic control for the PUD's arborist team," says
   DOT spokesperson, Lauren Loebsack. "Drivers can expect some traffic delays
   and some intermittent closures of the Riverwalk Trail through that area
   while the work is going on."

   Loebsack adds that while projects involving the DOT are rare during the
   winter months, the one in Chelan is happening at an ideal time of the
   year.

   "Trimming trees in the winter is probably the preferred time when they are
   dormant, and the removal of trees of trees is also better because there
   won't be as much material to clean up since there aren't as many leaves on
   the trees. This work will also be weather dependent, so if it does end up
   raining or snowing that day we're going to need to bump that work down the
   road a bit."

   The project is scheduled to happen on Tuesday, Jan. 9 from 8:30 a.m. to
   3:30 p.m.

 Steve McQueen’s ‘Lynching Tree’ exhibit comes to the Isabella Stewart Gardner

   A docent in the Yale Center for British Art tapped Lee Pelton on the
   shoulder and handed him a box of tissues. The president of The Boston
   Foundation had been moved to tears observing an exhibit titled Lynching
   Tree (2013) by Steve McQueen.

   For several weeks, the experience stayed with Pelton. He wanted to bring
   it to Boston.

   He noted that the title of the exhibit is not “The Lynching Tree”, but
   rather “Lynching Tree" — a symbolic representation of the terror of
   lynching, which claimed the lives of almost 4,500 Black Americans from
   1877-1950 in the years after the Civil War.

   “I was really overcome with grief and a kind of horrific pain," Pelton
   said of the exhibit Tuesday on Boston Public Radio. "What it represented
   for me is the way in which history, particularly of Black Americans, is
   hidden."

   Pelton said he thought the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum was the best
   place to "recreate the experience that I had with its intimacy.”

   Peggy Fogelman, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, agreed.
   Steve McQueen’s "Lynching Tree" will be exhibited at the museum for two
   weeks, from Jan. 20 through Feb. 4, 2024.

   “This is a continuation of the kind of work that the Gardner has been
   doing over the past few years," Fogelman said. "Our exhibitions are built
   on the premise that art has something really important to say about the
   issues that face us today.”

   The museum usually plans out exhibits 3 to 5 years in advance but made an
   exception.

   “We could wait five years and give it the normal exhibition full run,
   which is three months, or we could do it now and have a shorter run. And
   it seemed to both of us really important to do it now,” Fogelman said.

   The timing of the exhibit also coincides with the ten-year anniversary of
   McQueen's Academy Award for "12 Years a Slave" and the 50th anniversary of
   the desegregation crisis in Boston schools. It also marks the second time
   the photograph will be displayed in an American museum, following its
   initial showcase at Yale.

   Steve McQueen's preference for displaying Lynching Tree on its own will be
   honored by its placement in the Fenway Gallery. Both Pelton and Fogelman
   said they are eager to witness Boston's response to the exhibit,
   anticipating not only a deep emotional response from visitors but also a
   collective confrontation with the "ugly and horrific truths" the work
   represents.

   “That's the only way we can move forward,” Fogelman said.

   Microsoft Start’s personalized content feed makes it easy to catch up on
   the things you care about, from news and traffic to sports, entertainment,
   hobbies and weather. Now, on the heels of Earth Day this year, Microsoft
   Start is also helping you give back to the planet. By using Weather from
   Microsoft Start, you can help contribute to a greener, more sustainable
   Earth by growing an E-tree!

   Weather from Microsoft Start offers hyper-local, up-to-the-minute
   forecasts and interactive maps with beautiful animations and visuals – all
   to keep you constantly informed about the weather where it matters to you
   most. With a tool this powerful, the challenge is helping people discover
   all the information available to them – to help, we launched “E-trees.”  

   This fun, guided, interactive experience is designed to reward users for
   engaging with different parts of Weather from Microsoft Start. Once you
   join, users will earn points through simple daily tasks – things like
   checking precipitation, temperature, or wind in your area. Progress is
   easy to track as you earn points and grow your very own E-tree! 

   As your E-tree grows, Microsoft will work to turn it into a real tree. To
   make this happen, we’ve partnered with the Eden Restoration Projects, a
   non-profit committed to restoring forests and protecting ecosystems in
   high-risk or unstable areas. 

   It only takes a few easy steps to get started and plant your E-tree – just
   launch Weather from the Windows 10 or Windows 11 taskbar, from the Weather
   card on the feed in a new tab in Edge, or by heading to
   MicrosoftStart.com. On the Weather page, you’ll find the seed on the left
   where you’ll be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft Account and then
   click “Join now.”

   Once you sign in and join, you’ll be able to give your E-tree a unique
   name. Then, you can start nurturing your tree by collecting energy points
   right away. Each time you launch Weather and click on your tree, you’ll
   see suggested tasks and new ways to get points daily while learning more
   about the weather where you live or in another area you care about – like
   seeing how much rain to expect where you’re going on vacation next or
   keeping track of extreme weather somewhere you have family or friends.

   Just like a real tree, an E-tree needs water, air, and sunlight.
   Conveniently, Weather from Microsoft Start can deliver meaningful
   information about each of these. The site includes detailed maps with
   beautiful animations showing wind, heat – or a Redmond favorite – the
   precipitation map. The hourly forecast animation helps to plan the best
   time for walking the dog, riding a bike, or even taking a quick “sun
   break” to make the most of the sunshine. 

   Once your tree reaches 10,000 points, you’ll receive an E-tree certificate
   and the Eden Restoration Projects will plant a real tree in the Mwamdudu
   site, just outside the bustling city of Mombasa, Kenya. You can even see
   how fast other people are their E-trees!

   E-Trees bring together the best weather tools with a fun experience, plus
   the chance to make the world a greener place – one tree at a time.

      What's the oldest tree on Earth—and will it survive climate change?

   Bristlecone pines in the western U.S. have been alive for nearly 5,000
   years, but an upstart Patagonian cypress challenges that record.

   This 1,400-year-old bristlecone pine on Mount Washington in Nevada’s Great
   Basin National Park is so iconic its image is stamped on the back of some
   U.S. quarters. For decades, bristlecone pines, which can survive for up to
   5,000 years, were thought to be the planet’s oldest living things. Now a
   tree in Chile is posing a challenge.

   Great Basin National ParkThousands of feet above the Nevada desert, in a
   part of Great Basin National Park that tourists rarely see, park ecologist
   Gretchen Baker neared the top of Mount Washington and raised her
   binoculars. There just below, sprouting directly from the limestone, grew
   some of the oldest living things on Earth.

   Great Basin bristlecone pines, their dense pale trunks twisted like thick
   rope by centuries of gusting wind and rain, thrive here in part because so
   little else does. At altitudes near 11,000 feet along Nevada’s rocky Snake
    Range there are no grasses, no brush, few pests, no competition. No
   people to start wildfires. No nearby trees to spread pathogens.

   With nothing around to kill them, these ancient beasts are left alone year
   after year to simply do what they do: store water in needles that can live
   for decades and pack on the teensiest bit of heft at a time. The wood
   grows so slowly it gets too dense for beetles or disease to penetrate.

   Left: This young bristlecone pine was spared during the Phillips Ranch
   Fire in 2000, which killed thousands of others. One reason bristlecones
   live so long is that they grow in relative isolation, so fires rarely
   spread through their groves. But as fires grow bigger and more intense
   with climate change, the infernos pose a greater threat to these
   long-lived trees. 
   Right: Bristlecones grow slowly, which makes their sculpted wood difficult
   for pathogens and insects to penetrate, helping them live long lives.
   Their annual growth rings hold information about climate variability
   dating back thousands of years and are a valuable resource for
   scientists. 
   Another strategy that keeps bristlecone pines going is “strip barking.”
   Even when sections of the tree die, the rest may live on as narrow bands
   of living tissue and bark connect roots to high branches. In some cases 95
   percent of the tree may be dead, while this small portion lives on.

   Some individual bristlecones have survived this way since before the
   pyramids were erected at Giza. That includes Methuselah, in California’s
   White Mountains, the oldest documented living bristlecone, which, based on
   tree-ring data, is 4,853 years old.

   Scientists have long believed that makes this tree the planet’s oldest
   single living thing. But that argument grew more complicated this month
   after a Chilean researcher used unusual techniques to date a tree of a
   different species, a Patagonian cypress. If correct, his work would make
   that South American conifer the newest oldest thing.

   The claim has tree researchers abuzz but skeptical, at least in part
   because the cypress, growing in a temperate rainforest, appears to live
   such a different life than a bristlecone. Despite their longevity both the
   bristlecones and the interloper are now facing questions about how well
   they’ll navigate the coming decades.

An old rival

   Patagonian cypresses, also known as alerces, are native to Chile and
   Argentina and have long been recognized as the world’s second
   longest-lived tree species. The previous record-setting alerce was
   identified in the early 1990s by counting tree rings on a cut stump; it
   was more than 3,600 years old. (The oldest known giant sequoia, the third
   longest-lived species, was identified the same way and lived to 3,266.)

   But earlier this month, a story in Science by Gabriel Popkin revealed that
   environmental scientist Jonathan Barichivich and the researcher who first
   identified that old alerce had been studying another tree in a Chilean
   national park. The researchers used a T-shaped increment borer to drill in
   and remove a core sample from the moss-draped cypress. The boring device
   couldn’t reach the center of the tree, which is more than a dozen feet in
   diameter. But by combining their core sample with tree-ring information
   from other alerces, and using computer modeling, the pair estimated the
   tree was roughly 5,400 years old, with an 80 percent chance it was more
   than 5,000 years old.

   By combining a partial core sample with computer modeling, researchers in
   South America believe they can show that this Patagonian cypress tree,
   also called an alerce, towering out of a ravine in Chile, is at least
   5,000 years old, which would make it Earth’s oldest living tree. Some
   experts are skeptical.

   The research has not been peer-reviewed yet, but Barichivich has shared
   his findings at conferences. Nate Stephenson, an emeritus scientist with
   the U.S. Geological Survey, who has studied giant sequoias for four
   decades, finds the results interesting, but is withholding judgment until
   Barichivich publishes a paper detailing his methods. Still, “the prospect
   is certainly exciting,” Stephenson tells Popkin.

   Others, though, are quite skeptical. Peter Brown, founder of Rocky
   Mountain Tree Ring Research, which gathers information on the world’s
   oldest trees, says Barichivich’s approach is too novel to make such a bold
   claim before publication. “There are many assumptions necessary for
   extrapolating total age from that,” Brown says.

   Brown doesn’t doubt the tree is significant. The partial core alone seems
   to show the tree was at least 2,400 years old, which would put it among
   the top 10 oldest trees on Brown’s list. But Brown has other reasons to be
   suspicious. For example, “this new estimated age is over 1,500 years older
   than the oldest known (alerce) tree to date,” Brown says.

   Brown also sees significant differences between the types of environments
   that tend to support the very oldest trees and the surroundings of the
   Patagonian cypress. In an isolated, austere landscape, like the snowy,
   rocky homes of slow-growing bristlecone, trees can just keep on going.
   Mossy rainforests, on the other hand, are full of life—and threats.

   Scientists still argue about why some trees are able to live so long. “My
   contention is that trees don’t necessarily die from old age like mammals,”
   Brown says. “Something has to come along and kill them.”

   Barichivich understands the skepticism. He says his colleague has found
   another alerce stump whose tree rings can all be counted and show it to be
   about 4,100 years old. (That data is also not yet published.) He also
   argues that tree-ring data suggests alerce actually grow more slowly than
   bristlecones, meaning their wood is also very dense.

   And as part of a recent research team that analyzed the relationship
   between the world’s longest-lived trees and climate, Barichivich believes
   the two species’ worlds are similar in the most important ways. The
   Chilean Coast Range is nothing like the American West, he says, “but there
   are special conditions here, too.”

   His ancient alerce grows on a cloudy south-facing slope, where the annual
   mean temperature is roughly 45 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s found in a ravine,
   protected from fire and until recently from humans. Barichivich says his
   own Chilean grandfather, who worked as a ranger in the park, discovered
   the tree in the early 1970s and may well have been the first person to
   touch it.

   Bristlecones live in harsh environments, often sprouting out of dry, rocky
   soils above 11,000 feet where little else can survive. Pummeled by
   relentless winds, they curl and bend and don’t reach great heights, but
   their diameter may continue to expand for centuries.

A common threat

   Regardless of which species turns out to be the longevity champ, those who
   study the world’s oldest trees are united by a common concern for how
   their favorite species will make it through rough times ahead.

   Wildfires worsened by our fossil fuel emissions have wiped out up to 19
   percent of California’s giant sequoias in just the last two years.

   (Read about how forests are reeling from climate change—but the future
   isn’t lost.)

   While the location of the very oldest bristlecones are kept secret,
   Barichivich’s Chilean tree now draws lots of tourists, who stomp around
   its base, potentially damaging roots. Climate change is also drying out
   the region, which could threaten the tree’s water uptake.

   Bristlecones, too, are seeing a changing world. On a cloudless day last
   July, Gretchen Baker’s pickup lurched up a gravel road so steep it felt at
   times like it might tumble off the mountain. Anna Schoettle, a plant
   ecophysiologist with the U.S. Forest Service, bounced around in the back
   seat. They were here to explain how the ancient pines might weather rising
   temperatures.

   The oldest living sequoias were seedlings more than 3,200 years ago,
   around the time of the Trojan War. Back then, the oldest bristlecones
   living today would already have been around for 1,600 years.

   One reason for that is the bristlecone’s capacity to handle stress. As
   soil erosion or root decay and age weaken a bristlecone’s trunk or
   branches, the entire tree does not die—only the portion under direct
   stress. Instead, these majestic beings practice “strip barking,” allowing
   thin bands of living tissue beneath the bark to curl up the tree
   delivering water from healthy roots. On some bristlecones, as little as 5
   percent of what you see may still, in fact, be alive.

   “You won’t usually see a super old tree that has bark all the way around
   it,” Baker says. “It’s just got this one little living part. Whole
   portions of the tree are now just really artistic-looking dead wood.”

   Bristlecones live across a broad altitude range, from about 6,500 feet up
   to more than 11,000 feet. They have survived all kinds of conditions. The
   trees are typically spaced far enough apart that even the occasional
   lightning-sparked fire rarely spreads beyond a few acres.

   But as we rounded a corner in Baker’s truck, an image of the planet’s new
   reality came into focus. We rolled by acre upon acre of burned husks. A
   hotter, bigger, more powerful fire, fueled in part by a changing climate,
   had blown through in the last few decades, wiping out many bristlecones.

   Warming temperatures, drought, and more explosive fire pose new threats to
   these ancient trees, but mostly at the lower end of their range.
   Bristlecones are also susceptible to blister rust, an imported fungus that
   has killed millions of related trees, including whitebark pines in
   Yellowstone National Park. So far it has not appeared in the wild in Great
   Basin bristlecones.

   “Blister rust is a threat, absolutely,” says Stanley Kitchen, an emeritus
   research scientist with the Forest Service. “How big of a threat is
   something I don’t know. That’s a big question mark for me.”

   Baker, Schoettle, and Kitchen worry that bristlecones at that lower edge
   of their elevation range are likely to have a rough time in coming years.

   But “I don’t worry about the direct effects of climate change on the upper
   half, where it’s most at home,” Kitchen says. “It would take, I think,
   even more climate change than is projected to make them disappear.”

             Everything you need to know about tree data structures

   TK TK
   Everything you need to know about tree data structures

   When you first learn to code, it’s common to learn arrays as the “main
   data structure.”

   Eventually, you will learn about hash tables too. If you are pursuing a
   Computer Science degree, you have to take a class on data structure. You
   will also learn about linked lists, queues, and stacks. Those data
   structures are called “linear” data structures because they all have a
   logical start and a logical end.

   When we start learning about trees and graphs, it can get really
   confusing. We don’t store data in a linear way. Both data structures store
   data in a specific way.

   This post is to help you better understand the Tree Data Structure and to
   clarify any confusion you may have about it.

   In this article, we will learn:

     * What is a tree
     * Examples of trees
     * Its terminology and how it works
     * How to implement tree structures in code.

   Let’s start this learning journey. :)

  Definition

   When starting out programming, it is common to understand better the
   linear data structures than data structures like trees and graphs.

   Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They don’t store data
   in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically.

  Let’s dive into real life examples!

   What do I mean when I say in a hierarchical way?

   Imagine a family tree with relationships from all generation:
   grandparents, parents, children, siblings, etc. We commonly organize
   family trees hierarchically.

   1*MasdC5DmucEU2abIXQe45QMy family tree

   The above drawing is is my family tree. Tossico, Akikazu, Hitomi, and
   Takemi are my grandparents.

   Toshiaki and Juliana are my parents.

   TK, Yuji, Bruno, and Kaio are the children of my parents (me and my
   brothers).

   An organization’s structure is another example of a hierarchy.

   1*GsBCmW5E1GuJ3MpH3Zz0EwA company’s structure is an example of a hierarchy

   In HTML, the Document Object Model (DOM) works as a tree.

   1*dLXUdR4NuIZG8GJdu_CinwDocument Object Model (DOM)

   The HTML tag contains other tags. We have a head tag and a body tag. Those
   tags contains specific elements. The head tag has meta and title tags. The
   body tag has elements that show in the user interface, for example, h1, a,
   li, etc.

  A technical definition

   A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by
   edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a
   child node .

   1*3WN7tIQ-kNBQmY9MgvTuOA

   The first node of the tree is called the root. If this root node is
   connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the
   connected node is a child.

   1*9AtR3bhhlMJxQlaUVEQgrw

   All Tree nodes are connected by links called edges. It’s an important part
   of trees, because it’s manages the relationship between nodes.

   1*j5qKwIxKcEjoxy88EOc1Rg

   Leaves are the last nodes on a tree. They are nodes without children. Like
   real trees, we have the root, branches, and finally the leaves.

   1*c9_5uMUsIy4Q3OA7Q8bJiw

   Other important concepts to understand are height and depth.

   The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf.

   The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root.

  Terminology summary

     * Root is the topmost node of the tree
     * Edge is the link between two nodes
     * Child is a node that has a parent node
     * Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
     * Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
     * Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
     * Depth is the length of the path to its root

  Binary trees

   Now we will discuss a specific type of tree. We call it thebinary tree.

     “In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which
     each node has at the most two children, which are referred to as the
     left child and the right child.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s look at an example of a binary tree.

   1*ofbwuz4inpf2OlB-l9gtHw

  Let’s code a binary tree

   The first thing we need to keep in mind when we implement a binary tree is
   that it is a collection of nodes. Each node has three attributes: value,
   left_child, and right_child.

   How do we implement a simple binary tree that initializes with these three
   properties?

   Let’s take a look.

 class BinaryTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

   Here it is. Our binary tree class.

   When we instantiate an object, we pass the value (the data of the node) as
   a parameter. Look at the left_child and the right_child. Both are set to
   None.

   Why?

   Because when we create our node, it doesn’t have any children. We just
   have the node data.

   Let’s test it:

 tree = BinaryTree('a')
 print(tree.value) # a
 print(tree.left_child) # None
 print(tree.right_child) # None

   That’s it.

   We can pass the string ‘a’ as the value to our Binary Tree node. If we
   print the value, left_child, and right_child, we can see the values.

   Let’s go to the insertion part. What do we need to do here?

   We will implement a method to insert a new node to the right and to the
   left.

   Here are the rules:

     * If the current node doesn’t have a left child, we just create a new
       nodeand set it to the current node’s left_child.
     * If it does have the left child, we create a new node and put it in the
       current left child’s place. Allocate this left child node to the new
       node’s left child.

   Let’s draw it out. :)

   1*ofbwuz4inpf2OlB-l9gtHw

   Here’s the code:

 def insert_left(self, value):
     if self.left_child == None:
         self.left_child = BinaryTree(value)
     else:
         new_node = BinaryTree(value)
         new_node.left_child = self.left_child
         self.left_child = new_node

   Again, if the current node doesn’t have a left child, we just create a new
   node and set it to the current node’s left_child. Or else we create a new
   node and put it in the current left child’s place. Allocate this left
   child node to the new node’s left child.

   And we do the same thing to insert a right child node.

 def insert_right(self, value):
     if self.right_child == None:
         self.right_child = BinaryTree(value)
     else:
         new_node = BinaryTree(value)
         new_node.right_child = self.right_child
         self.right_child = new_node

   Done. :)

   But not entirely. We still need to test it.

   Let’s build the followingtree:

   1*V_EUgNXVc8Wy9H1-JoqT3g

   To summarize the illustration of this tree:

     * a node will be the root of our binary Tree
     * a left child is b node
     * a right child is c node
     * b right child is d node (b node doesn’t have a left child)
     * c left child is e node
     * c right child is f node
     * both e and f nodes do not have children

   So here is the code for the tree:

 a_node = BinaryTree('a')
 a_node.insert_left('b')
 a_node.insert_right('c')

 b_node = a_node.left_child
 b_node.insert_right('d')

 c_node = a_node.right_child
 c_node.insert_left('e')
 c_node.insert_right('f')

 d_node = b_node.right_child
 e_node = c_node.left_child
 f_node = c_node.right_child

 print(a_node.value) # a
 print(b_node.value) # b
 print(c_node.value) # c
 print(d_node.value) # d
 print(e_node.value) # e
 print(f_node.value) # f

   Insertion is done.

   Now we have to think about tree traversal.

   We have two options here: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First
   Search (BFS).

     * DFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each
       branch before backtracking.” — Wikipedia
     * BFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
       It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes first,
       before moving to the next level neighbors.” — Wikipedia

   So let’s dive into each tree traversal type.

    Depth-First Search (DFS)

   DFS explores a path all the way to a leaf before backtracking and
   exploring another path. Let’s take a look at an example with this type of
   traversal.

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result for this algorithm will be 1–2–3–4–5–6–7.

   Why?

   Let’s break it down.

    1. Start at the root (1). Print it.

   2. Go to the left child (2). Print it.

   3. Then go to the left child (3). Print it. (This node doesn’t have any
   children)

   4. Backtrack and go the right child (4). Print it. (This node doesn’t have
   any children)

   5. Backtrack to the root node and go to the right child (5). Print it.

   6. Go to the left child (6). Print it. (This node doesn’t have any
   children)

   7. Backtrack and go to the right child (7). Print it. (This node doesn’t
   have any children)

   8. Done.

   When we go deep to the leaf and backtrack, this is called DFS algorithm.

   Now that we are familiar with this traversal algorithm, we will discuss
   types of DFS: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

    Pre-order

   This is exactly what we did in the above example.

    1. Print the value of the node.
    2. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    3. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.

 def pre_order(self):
     print(self.value)

     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.pre_order()

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.pre_order()

    In-order

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result of the in-order algorithm for this tree example is
   3–2–4–1–6–5–7.

   The left first, the middle second, and the right last.

   Now let’s code it.

 def in_order(self):
     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.in_order()

     print(self.value)

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.in_order()

    1. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    2. Print the node’s value
    3. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.

    Post-order

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   The result of the post order algorithm for this tree example is
   3–4–2–6–7–5–1.

   The left first, the right second, and the middle last.

   Let’s code this.

 def post_order(self):
     if self.left_child:
         self.left_child.post_order()

     if self.right_child:
         self.right_child.post_order()

     print(self.value)

    1. Go to the left child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       left child.
    2. Go to the right child and print it. This is if, and only if, it has a
       right child.
    3. Print the node’s value

    Breadth-First Search (BFS)

   BFS algorithm traverses the tree level by level and depth by depth.

   1*ZNxp_NkRZLCeak85rreebA

   Here is an example that helps to better explain this algorithm:

   1*-sCuUx3R9e1ougu2pGdThg

   So we traverse level by level. In this example, the result is
   1–2–5–3–4–6–7.

     * Level/Depth 0: only node with value 1
     * Level/Depth 1: nodes with values 2 and 5
     * Level/Depth 2: nodes with values 3, 4, 6, and 7

   Now let’s code it.

 def bfs(self):
     queue = Queue()
     queue.put(self)

     while not queue.empty():
         current_node = queue.get()
         print(current_node.value)

         if current_node.left_child:
             queue.put(current_node.left_child)

         if current_node.right_child:
             queue.put(current_node.right_child)

   To implement a BFS algorithm, we use the queue data structure to help.

   How does it work?

   Here’s the explanation.

   1*A4yGfEoiqcZ-COvAfr2CWQ
    1. First add the root node into the queue with the put method.
    2. Iterate while the queue is not empty.
    3. Get the first node in the queue, and then print its value.
    4. Add both left and right children into the queue (if the current
       nodehas children).
    5. Done. We will print the value of each node, level by level, with our
       queuehelper.

  Binary Search tree

     “A Binary Search Tree is sometimes called ordered or sorted binary
     trees, and it keeps its values in sorted order, so that lookup and other
     operations can use the principle of binary search” — Wikipedia

   An important property of a Binary Search Tree is that the value of a
   Binary Search Tree nodeis larger than the value of the offspring of its
   left child, but smaller than the value of the offspring of its right
   child.”

   1*mslH9VtVUN9Hs983XxUN5A

   Here is a breakdown of the above illustration:

     * A is inverted. The subtree 7–5–8–6 needs to be on the right side, and
       the subtree 2–1–3 needs to be on the left.
     * B is the only correct option. It satisfies the Binary Search Tree
       property.
     * C has one problem: the node with the value 4. It needs to be on the
       left side of the root because it is smaller than 5.

  Let’s code a Binary Search Tree!

   Now it’s time to code!

   What will we see here? We will insert new nodes, search for a value,
   delete nodes, and the balance of the tree.

   Let’s start.

    Insertion: adding new nodes to our tree

   Imagine that we have an empty tree and we want to add new nodes with the
   following values in this order: 50, 76, 21, 4, 32, 100, 64, 52.

   The first thing we need to know is if 50 is the root of our tree.

   1*fxSlTwgQSN_DlzfEmcxqQg

   We can now start inserting node by node.

     * 76 is greater than 50, so insert 76 on the right side.
     * 21 is smaller than 50, so insert 21 on the left side.
     * 4 is smaller than 50. Node with value 50 has a left child 21. Since 4
       is smaller than 21, insert it on the left side of this node.
     * 32 is smaller than 50. Node with value 50 has a left child 21. Since
       32 is greater than 21, insert 32 on the right side of this node.
     * 100 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       100 is greater than 76, insert 100 on the right side of this node.
     * 64 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       64 is smaller than 76, insert 64 on the left side of this node.
     * 52 is greater than 50. Node with value 50 has a right child 76. Since
       52 is smaller than 76, node with value 76 has a left child 64. 52 is
       smaller than 64, so insert 54 on the left side of this node.
   1*LlLDNx7wgJfH6VAGnyAbIQ

   Do you notice a pattern here?

   Let’s break it down.

    1. Is the new node value greater or smaller than the current node?
    2. If the value of the new node is greater than the current node, go to
       the right subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a right child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    3. If the value of the new node is smaller than the current node, go to
       the left subtree. If the current node doesn’t have a left child,
       insert it there, or else backtrack to step #1.
    4. We did not handle special cases here. When the value of a new node is
       equal to the current value of the node, use rule number 3. Consider
       inserting equal values to the left side of the subtree.

   Now let’s code it.

 class BinarySearchTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

     def insert_node(self, value):
         if value @lt;= self.value and self.left_child:
             self.left_child.insert_node(value)
         elif value @lt;= self.value:
             self.left_child = BinarySearchTree(value)
         elif value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
             self.right_child.insert_node(value)
         else:
             self.right_child = BinarySearchTree(value)

   It seems very simple.

   The powerful part of this algorithm is the recursion part, which is on
   line 9 and line 13. Both lines of code call the insert_node method, and
   use it for its left and right children, respectively. Lines 11 and 15 are
   the ones that do the insertion for each child.

    Let’s search for the node value… Or not…

   The algorithm that we will build now is about doing searches. For a given
   value (integer number), we will say if our Binary Search Tree does or does
   not have that value.

   An important item to note is how we defined the tree insertion algorithm.
   First we have our root node. All the left subtree nodes will have smaller
   values than the root node. And all the right subtree nodes will have
   values greater than the root node.

   Let’s take a look at an example.

   Imagine that we have this tree.

   1*LlLDNx7wgJfH6VAGnyAbIQ

   Now we want to know if we have a node based on value 52.

   1*NwvTrpKiJWb1u2yAY-nnAA

   Let’s break it down.

    1. We start with the root node as our current node. Is the given value
       smaller than the current node value? If yes, then we will search for
       it on the left subtree.
    2. Is the given value greater than the current node value? If yes, then
       we will search for it on the right subtree.
    3. If rules #1 and #2 are both false, we can compare the current node
       value and the given value if they are equal. If the comparison returns
       true, then we can say, “Yeah! Our tree has the given value,”
       otherwise, we say, “Nooo, it hasn’t.”

   Now let’s code it.

 class BinarySearchTree:
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
         self.left_child = None
         self.right_child = None

     def find_node(self, value):
         if value @lt; self.value and self.left_child:
             return self.left_child.find_node(value)
         if value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
             return self.right_child.find_node(value)

         return value == self.value

   Let’s beak down the code:

     * Lines 8 and 9 fall under rule #1.
     * Lines 10 and 11 fall under rule #2.
     * Line 13 falls under rule #3.

   How do we test it?

   Let’s create our Binary Search Tree by initializing the root node with the
   value 15.

 bst = BinarySearchTree(15)

   And now we will insert many new nodes.

 bst.insert_node(10)
 bst.insert_node(8)
 bst.insert_node(12)
 bst.insert_node(20)
 bst.insert_node(17)
 bst.insert_node(25)
 bst.insert_node(19)

   For each inserted node , we will test if our find_node method really
   works.

 print(bst.find_node(15)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(10)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(8)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(12)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(20)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(17)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(25)) # True
 print(bst.find_node(19)) # True

   Yeah, it works for these given values! Let’s test for a value that doesn’t
   exist in our Binary Search Tree.

 print(bst.find_node(0)) # False

   Oh yeah.

   Our search is done.

    Deletion: removing and organizing

   Deletion is a more complex algorithm because we need to handle different
   cases. For a given value, we need to remove the node with this value.
   Imagine the following scenarios for this node : it has no children, has a
   single child, or has two children.

     * Scenario #1: A node with no children (leaf node).

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 20) ---@gt;   |30|   |70|
 #   /    \                                \
 # |20|   |40|                             |40|

   If the node we want to delete has no children, we simply delete it. The
   algorithm doesn’t need to reorganize the tree.

     * Scenario #2: A node with just one child (left or right child).

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 30) ---@gt;   |20|   |70|
 #   /           
 # |20|

   In this case, our algorithm needs to make the parent of the node point to
   the child node. If the node is the left child, we make the parent of the
   left child point to the child. If the node is the right child of its
   parent, we make the parent of the right child point to the child.

     * Scenario #3: A node with two children.

 #        |50|                              |50|
 #      /      \                           /    \
 #    |30|     |70|   (DELETE 30) ---@gt;   |40|   |70|
 #   /    \                             /
 # |20|   |40|                        |20|

   When the node has 2 children, we need to find the node with the minimum
   value, starting from the node’sright child. We will put this node with
   minimum value in the place of the node we want to remove.

   It’s time to code.

 def remove_node(self, value, parent):
     if value @lt; self.value and self.left_child:
         return self.left_child.remove_node(value, self)
     elif value @lt; self.value:
         return False
     elif value @gt; self.value and self.right_child:
         return self.right_child.remove_node(value, self)
     elif value @gt; self.value:
         return False
     else:
         if self.left_child is None and self.right_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = None
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child is None and self.right_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = None
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child and self.right_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = self.left_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.left_child and self.right_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = self.left_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.right_child and self.left_child is None and self == parent.left_child:
             parent.left_child = self.right_child
             self.clear_node()
         elif self.right_child and self.left_child is None and self == parent.right_child:
             parent.right_child = self.right_child
             self.clear_node()
         else:
             self.value = self.right_child.find_minimum_value()
             self.right_child.remove_node(self.value, self)

         return True

    1. First: Note the parameters value and parent. We want to find the
       nodethat has this value , and the node’s parent is important to the
       removal of the node.
    2. Second: Note the returning value. Our algorithm will return a boolean
       value. It returns True if it finds the node and removes it. Otherwise
       it will return False.
    3. From line 2 to line 9: We start searching for the node that has the
       valuethat we are looking for. If the value is smaller than the current
       nodevalue , we go to the left subtree, recursively (if, and only if,
       the current node has a left child). If the value is greater, go to the
       right subtree, recursively.
    4. Line 10: We start to think about the remove algorithm.
    5. From line 11 to line 13: We cover the node with no children , and it
       is the left child from its parent. We remove the node by setting the
       parent’s left child to None.
    6. Lines 14 and 15: We cover the node with no children , and it is the
       right child from it’s parent. We remove the node by setting the
       parent’s right child to None.
    7. Clear node method: I will show the clear_node code below. It sets the
       nodes left child , right child, and its value to None.
    8. From line 16 to line 18: We cover the node with just one child (left
       child), and it is the left child from it’s parent. We set the parent's
       left child to the node’s left child (the only child it has).
    9. From line 19 to line 21: We cover the node with just one child (left
       child), and it is the right child from its parent. We set the parent's
       right child to the node’s left child (the only child it has).
   10. From line 22 to line 24: We cover the node with just one child (right
       child), and it is the left child from its parent. We set the parent's
       left child to the node’s right child (the only child it has).
   11. From line 25 to line 27: We cover the node with just one child (right
       child) , and it is the right child from its parent. We set the
       parent's right child to the node’s right child (the only child it
       has).
   12. From line 28 to line 30: We cover the node with both left and
       rightchildren. We get the node with the smallest value (the code is
       shown below) and set it to the value of the current node . Finish it
       by removing the smallest node.
   13. Line 32: If we find the node we are looking for, it needs to return
       True. From line 11 to line 31, we handle this case. So just return
       True and that’s it.
     * To use the clear_node method: set the None value to all three
       attributes — (value, left_child, and right_child)

 def clear_node(self):
     self.value = None
     self.left_child = None
     self.right_child = None

     * To use the find_minimum_value method: go way down to the left. If we
       can’t find anymore nodes, we found the smallest one.

 def find_minimum_value(self):
     if self.left_child:
         return self.left_child.find_minimum_value()
     else:
         return self.value

   Now let’s test it.

   We will use this tree to test our remove_node algorithm.

 #        |15|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #   /    \    /    \
 # |8|   |12| |17| |25|
 #              \
 #              |19|

   Let’s remove the node with the value 8. It’s a node with no child.

 print(bst.remove_node(8, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #     |15|
 #   /      \
 # |10|     |20|
 #    \    /    \
 #   |12| |17| |25|
 #          \
 #          |19|

   Now let’s remove the node with the value 17. It’s a node with just one
   child.

 print(bst.remove_node(17, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #        |15|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #       \    /    \
 #      |12| |19| |25|

   Finally, we will remove a node with two children. This is the root of our
   tree.

 print(bst.remove_node(15, None)) # True
 bst.pre_order_traversal()

 #        |19|
 #      /      \
 #    |10|     |20|
 #        \        \
 #        |12|     |25|

   The tests are now done. :)

  That’s all for now!

   We learned a lot here.

   What a phylogenetic tree is. How to read phylogenetic trees and determine
   which species are most related.

Key points:

     * A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that represents evolutionary
       relationships among organisms. Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, not
       definitive facts.
     * The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species
       or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors.
     * In trees, two species are more related if they have a more recent
       common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common
       ancestor.
     * Phylogenetic trees can be drawn in various equivalent styles. Rotating
       a tree about its branch points doesn't change the information it
       carries.

Introduction

   Humans as a group are big on organizing things. Not necessarily things
   like closets or rooms; I personally score low on the organization front
   for both of those things. Instead, people often like to group and order
   the things they see in the world around them. Starting with the Greek
   philosopher Aristotle, this desire to classify has extended to the many
   and diverse living things of Earth.
   Most modern systems of classification are based on evolutionary
   relationships among organisms – that is, on the organisms’ phylogeny.
   Classification systems based on phylogeny organize species or other groups
   in ways that reflect our understanding of how they evolved from their
   common ancestors.
   In this article, we'll take a look at phylogenetic trees, diagrams that
   represent evolutionary relationships among organisms. We'll see exactly
   what we can (and can't!) infer from a phylogenetic tree, as well as what
   it means for organisms to be more or less related in the context of these
   trees.

Anatomy of a phylogenetic tree

   When we draw a phylogenetic tree, we are representing our best hypothesis
   about how a set of species (or other groups) evolved from a common
   ancestor1‍ . As we'll explore further in the article on building trees,
   this hypothesis is based on information we’ve collected about our set of
   species – things like their physical features and the DNA sequences of
   their genes.
   [Are phylogenetic trees only for species?]
   In a phylogenetic tree, the species or groups of interest are found at the
   tips of lines referred to as the tree's branches. For example, the
   phylogenetic tree below represents relationships between five species, A,
   B, C, D, and E, which are positioned at the ends of the branches:
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The pattern in which the branches connect represents our understanding of
   how the species in the tree evolved from a series of common ancestors.
   Each branch point (also called an internal node) represents a divergence
   event, or splitting apart of a single group into two descendant groups.
   At each branch point lies the most recent common ancestor of all the
   groups descended from that branch point. For instance, at the branch point
   giving rise to species A and B, we would find the most recent common
   ancestor of those two species. At the branch point right above the root of
   the tree, we would find the most recent common ancestor of all the species
   in the tree (A, B, C, D, E).
   [Why is this the most recent common ancestor of all the species?]
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, labeled root, which branches (at a branch point) to form species
   E and another line that branches into a pair of double branches. From
   there, the first pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the
   second pair of double branches forms species C and D. The first branch
   point in the tree is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A, B, C, D,
   and E. The point where the tree branches into species A and B is labeled
   Most recent common ancestor of A and B.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   Each horizontal line in our tree represents a series of ancestors, leading
   up to the species at its end. For instance, the line leading up to species
   E represents the species' ancestors since it diverged from the other
   species in the tree. Similarly, the root represents a series of ancestors
   leading up to the most recent common ancestor of all the species in the
   tree.

Which species are more related?

   In a phylogenetic tree, the relatedness of two species has a very specific
   meaning. Two species are more related if they have a more recent common
   ancestor, and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.
   We can use a pretty straightforward method to find the most recent common
   ancestor of any pair or group of species. In this method, we start at the
   branch ends carrying the two species of interest and “walk backwards” in
   the tree until we find the point where the species’ lines converge.
   For instance, suppose that we wanted to say whether A and B or B and C are
   more closely related. To do so, we would follow the lines of both pairs of
   species backward in the tree. Since A and B converge at a common ancestor
   first as we move backwards, and B only converges with C after its junction
   point with A, we can say that A and B are more related than B and C.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D. The point where the tree branches
   into species A and B is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A and B. A
   pink line traces from species A back to this point, while a red line
   traces from species B back to this point. The point where the tree
   branches into a pair of double branches is labeled Most recent common
   ancestor of B and C. A red line traces from species B back to this point,
   while a lavender line traces from species C back to this point.

   al., CC BY 4.0
   Importantly, there are some species whose relatedness we can't compare
   using this method. For instance, we can't say whether A and B are more
   closely related than C and D. That’s because, by default, the horizontal
   axis of the tree doesn't represent time in a direct way. So, we can only
   compare the timing of branching events that occur on the same lineage
   (same direct line from the root of the tree), and not those that occur on
   different lineages.

Some tips for reading phylogenetic trees

   You may see phylogenetic trees drawn in many different formats. Some are
   blocky, like the tree at left below. Others use diagonal lines, like the
   tree at right below. You may also see trees of either kind oriented
   vertically or flipped on their sides, as shown for the blocky tree.
   Three examples of phylogenetic trees. The first tree is horizontal with a
   root on the left and branches forming 90 degree angles before forming
   species on the right hand side. The second tree is similar to the first
   tree, but it is vertical, with the root at the bottom and the species
   listed at the top. The third tree is similar to the second tree, but the
   branches are diagonal.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The three trees above represent identical relationships among species A,
   B, C, D, and E. You may want to take a moment to convince yourself that
   this is really the case – that is, that no branching patterns or
   recent-ness of common ancestors are different between the two trees. The
   identical information in these different-looking trees reminds us that
   it's the branching pattern (and not the lengths of branches) that's
   meaningful in a typical tree.
   Another critical point about these trees is that if you rotate the
   structures, using one of the branch points as a pivot, you don’t change
   the relationships. So just like the two trees above, which show the same
   relationships even though they are formatted differently, all of the trees
   below show the same relationships among four species:
   A series of vertical phylogenetic trees showing that phylogenetic trees
   can be rotated at a branch, resulting in the same tree. Numbers will be
   assigned to the branches for description, but do not appear in the
   diagram. The first tree begins with a root at the bottom, which splits
   into branches 1 and 2. Branch 1 becomes species W. Branch 2 splits into
   branches 3 and 4. Branch 3 becomes species X. Branch 4 splits into
   branches 5 and 6, which becomes species Y and Z respectively. The species
   are listed from left to right as W, X, Y, and Z. If branch 2 is rotated
   horizontally 180 degrees it results in the same tree, although the species
   are listed from left to right as W, Z, Y, and X. At the bottom of the
   diagram four equal trees are shown, but with rotations occurring at
   different branches.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 3 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   If you don’t see right away how that is true (and I didn’t, on first
   read!), just concentrate on the relationships and the branch points rather
   than on the ordering of species (W, X, Y, and Z) across the tops of the
   diagrams. That ordering actually doesn’t give us useful information.
   Instead, it’s the branch structure of each diagram that tells us what we
   need to understand the tree.
   So far, all the trees we've looked at have had nice, clean branching
   patterns, with just two lineages (lines of descent) emerging from each
   branch point. However, you may see trees with a polytomy (poly, many;
   tomy, cuts), meaning a branch point that has three or more different
   species coming off of it2‍ . In general, a polytomy shows where we don't
   have enough information to determine branching order.
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. The root branches into a lower branch that
   becomes species U and an upper branch that further splits into two
   branches. The bottom branch splits into two branches, forming species S
   and T. The top branch splits into 3 branches, forming species P, Q, and R.
   These three species are highlighted and labeled Polytomy: we don't have
   enough info to determine branching order!

   al., CC BY 4.0
   If we later get more information about the species in a tree, we may be
   able to resolve a polytomy using the new information.

Where do these trees come from?

   To generate a phylogenetic tree, scientists often compare and analyze many
   characteristics of the species or other groups involved. These
   characteristics can include external morphology (shape/appearance),
   internal anatomy, behaviors, biochemical pathways, DNA and protein
   sequences, and even the characteristics of fossils.
   To build accurate, meaningful trees, biologists will often use many
   different characteristics (reducing the chances of any one imperfect piece
   of data leading to a wrong tree). Still, phylogenetic trees are
   hypotheses, not definitive answers, and they can only be as good as the
   data available when they're made. Trees are revised and updated over time
   as new data becomes available and can be added to the analysis. This is
   particularly true today, as DNA sequencing increases our ability to
   compare genes between species.
   In the next article on building a tree, we’ll see concrete examples of how
   different types of data are used to organize species into phylogenetic
   trees.

            more
            Look at (or make) a tree showing your family going back at least
            to your grandparents.

            First question: What does this tell you about people in your
            family?

            Phylogenetic trees are really very similar, but for species
            rather than individuals within a family.

            Second question: What do you mean by "more evolved"?

            Does this help?

            One example that comes to mind is that a phylogenetic tree
            determines where two organisms diverged from their common
            ancestors but not specifically when. These diagrams are not
            chronological in a direct way, more so a before and after
            situation. (Hope I helped, correct me if I am wrong)

            Phenetic speciation means classification of species by appearance
            alone. For example if two frogs look similar they are called a
            species even if they cannot mate.
            Phylogenetic classification does consider appearance and
            phenotype, but it also goes much further in terms of looking at
            functionality, and comparison of genomes. Phylogentics explains
            an organisms evolutionary history. This is a more rigorous system
            than phenetics.

            It is a difficult task. What you are asking is phylogenetic
            reconstruction from genomic sequence analysis. There are some
            ways to do this. One obvious way is to consider two species
            closest if they match at more base pairs. But what is difficult
            is to decide if one arose from the other or if they are at the
            same level, arising from a different common ancestor.

            All of this is very difficult and many algorithms are available,
            especially since genomic data itself is large, complex (different
            kinds of genomic data is available - RNA, DNA, Methylated DNA
            etc) and also based on what we know of the function of the genes
            (difference in functional gene is a more significant difference
            than the difference in non-functional genes).

            If you are interested, look up maximum-parsimony methods of
            phylogenetic tree reconstructions.

            The most accurate phylogenetic tree will have the fewest nodes.
            It's something called parsimony which means that the best tree is
            the simplest.

   Trees

   A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or
   as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data
   structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections
   between elements, giving a tree graph.

   Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of
   trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices.

   A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends
   containing no closed loops (cycles). In other words, it is a simple,
   undirected, connected, acyclic graph (or, equivalently, a connected
   forest). A tree with n nodes has n-1 graph edges. Conversely, a connected
   graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. All trees are bipartite graphs
   (Skiena 1990, p. 213). Trees with no particular node singled out are
   sometimes called free trees (or unrooted tree), by way of distinguishing
   them from rooted trees (Skiena 1990, Knuth 1997).

   The points of connection are known as forks and the segments as branches.
   Final segments and the nodes at their ends are called tree leaves. A tree
   with two branches at each fork and with one or two tree leaves at the end
   of each branch is called a binary tree.

   A graph can be tested in the Wolfram Language to see if it is a tree using
   TreeGraphQ[g].

   Hydrocarbons

   Trees find applications in many diverse fields, including computer
   science, the enumeration of saturated hydrocarbons, the study of
   electrical circuits, etc. (Harary 1994, p. 4). The graphs graphs
   corresponding to linear hydrocarbons illustrated above are known as
   (n-)alkane graphs (or sometimes caterpillar graphs).

   Trees are block graphs.

   A tree T has either one node that is a graph center, in which case it is
   called a centered tree, or two adjacent nodes that are graph centers, in
   which case it is called a bicentered tree (Harary 1994, p. 35).

   When a special node is designated to turn a tree into a rooted tree, it is
   called the root (or sometimes "Eve"). In such a tree, each of the nodes
   that is one graph edge further away from a given node is called a child,
   and nodes connected to the same node that are the same distance from the
   root vertex are called siblings.

   Note that two branches placed end-to-end are equivalent to a single
   branch, which means for example, that there is only one tree of order 3.
   The number t(n) of nonisomorphic trees of order n=1, 2, ... (where trees
   of orders 1, 2, ..., 6 are illustrated above), are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11,
   23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ... (OEIS A000055).

   The generating functions for the number of rooted trees

                  T(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)T_nx^n                         (1) 
                       =  xexp[sum_(r=1)^(infty)1/rT(x^r)]                (2) 

   is related to the generating function for the number of unrooted trees
   t(x) by

                      t(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)t_nx^n                     (3) 
                           =  T(x)-1/2[T^2(x)-T(x^2)].                    (4) 

   Otter showed that

   lim_(n-@gt;infty)(t_nn^(5/2))/(alpha^n)=beta,                             (5) 

   (Otter 1948, Harary and Palmer 1973, Knuth 1997), where alpha and beta are
   two constants. alpha is given by

                   alpha =  lim_(n-@gt;infty)(T_n)/(T_(n-1))                 (6) 
                         =  2.955765...                                   (7) 

   (OEIS A051491; Odlyzko 1995; Knuth 1997, p. 396, where Knuth writes
   1/alpha=2.9557... instead of alpha=2.9557...) and also as the unique
   positive root of

   T(1/x)=1.                                                              (8) 

   The constant beta is given by

beta = 1/(sqrt(2pi))[1+sum_(k=2)^(infty)T^'(1/(alpha^k))1/(alpha^k)]^(3/2)  (9) 
     = 0.5349485...                                                        (10) 

   (OEIS A086308; Knuth 1997, p. 396).

   If t_n is the number of nonisomorphic trees on n nodes, then an asymptotic
   series for t_n is given by

t_n∼alpha^nn^(-5/2)(0.5349496061...+(0.0441699018...)/n+(0.4853877311...)/(n^2)+(2.379745574...)/(n^3)+...), (11) 

   where the constants can be computed in terms of partial derivatives of the
   function

   F(x,y)=xexp[y+sum_(k=2)^infty(T(x^k))/k]-y                            (12) 

   (Plotkin and Rosenthal 1994; Finch 2003).

                             1.10. Decision Trees¶

   Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used
   for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that
   predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules
   inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise
   constant approximation.

   For instance, in the example below, decision trees learn from data to
   approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The
   deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the
   model.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Some advantages of decision trees are:

       * Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.

       * Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require
         data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank
         values to be removed. Some tree and algorithm combinations support
         missing values.

       * The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in
         the number of data points used to train the tree.

       * Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the
         scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables
         for now. Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing
         datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for
         more information.

       * Able to handle multi-output problems.

       * Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a
         model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by
         boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an
         artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to
         interpret.

       * Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it
         possible to account for the reliability of the model.

       * Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the
         true model from which the data were generated.

   The disadvantages of decision trees include:

       * Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
         generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms
         such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a
         leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to
         avoid this problem.

       * Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
         might result in a completely different tree being generated. This
         problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.

       * Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but
         piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure.
         Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.

       * The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
         NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple
         concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms
         are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where
         locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms
         cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This
         can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner,
         where the features and samples are randomly sampled with
         replacement.

       * There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do
         not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer
         problems.

       * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
         It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting
         with the decision tree.

1.10.1. Classification¶

   DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class
   classification on a dataset.

   As with other classifiers, DecisionTreeClassifier takes as input two
   arrays: an array X, sparse or dense, of shape (n_samples, n_features)
   holding the training samples, and an array Y of integer values, shape
   (n_samples,), holding the class labels for the training samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; Y = [0, 1]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

   After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict the class of
   samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict([[2., 2.]])
 array([1])

   In case that there are multiple classes with the same and highest
   probability, the classifier will predict the class with the lowest index
   amongst those classes.

   As an alternative to outputting a specific class, the probability of each
   class can be predicted, which is the fraction of training samples of the
   class in a leaf:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict_proba([[2., 2.]])
 array([[0., 1.]])

   DecisionTreeClassifier is capable of both binary (where the labels are
   [-1, 1]) classification and multiclass (where the labels are [0, …, K-1])
   classification.

   Using the Iris dataset, we can construct a tree as follows:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; iris = load_iris()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X, y = iris.data, iris.target
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)

   Once trained, you can plot the tree with the plot_tree function:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.plot_tree(clf)
 [...]

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_iris_dtc_002.png

   Alternative ways to export trees Click for more details

   We can also export the tree in Graphviz format using the export_graphviz
   exporter. If you use the conda package manager, the graphviz binaries and
   the python package can be installed with conda install python-graphviz.

   Alternatively binaries for graphviz can be downloaded from the graphviz
   project homepage, and the Python wrapper installed from pypi with pip
   install graphviz.

   Below is an example graphviz export of the above tree trained on the
   entire iris dataset; the results are saved in an output file iris.pdf:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; import graphviz
 @gt;@gt;@gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; graph.render("iris")

   The export_graphviz exporter also supports a variety of aesthetic options,
   including coloring nodes by their class (or value for regression) and
   using explicit variable and class names if desired. Jupyter notebooks also
   render these plots inline automatically:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None,
 ...                      feature_names=iris.feature_names, 
 ...                      class_names=iris.target_names, 
 ...                      filled=True, rounded=True, 
 ...                      special_characters=True)

   Alternatively, the tree can also be exported in textual format with the
   function export_text. This method doesn’t require the installation of
   external libraries and is more compact:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import export_text
 @gt;@gt;@gt; iris = load_iris()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0, max_depth=2)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; decision_tree = decision_tree.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; r = export_text(decision_tree, feature_names=iris['feature_names'])
 @gt;@gt;@gt; print(r)
 |--- petal width (cm) @lt;= 0.80
 |   |--- class: 0
 |--- petal width (cm) @gt;  0.80
 |   |--- petal width (cm) @lt;= 1.75
 |   |   |--- class: 1
 |   |--- petal width (cm) @gt;  1.75
 |   |   |--- class: 2

1.10.2. Regression¶

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_001.png

   Decision trees can also be applied to regression problems, using the
   DecisionTreeRegressor class.

   As in the classification setting, the fit method will take as argument
   arrays X and y, only that in this case y is expected to have floating
   point values instead of integer values:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn import tree
 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = [[0, 0], [2, 2]]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0.5, 2.5]
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf = clf.fit(X, y)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; clf.predict([[1, 1]])
 array([0.5])

   Examples:

     * Decision Tree Regression

1.10.3. Multi-output problems¶

   A multi-output problem is a supervised learning problem with several
   outputs to predict, that is when Y is a 2d array of shape (n_samples,
   n_outputs).

   When there is no correlation between the outputs, a very simple way to
   solve this kind of problem is to build n independent models, i.e. one for
   each output, and then to use those models to independently predict each
   one of the n outputs. However, because it is likely that the output values
   related to the same input are themselves correlated, an often better way
   is to build a single model capable of predicting simultaneously all n
   outputs. First, it requires lower training time since only a single
   estimator is built. Second, the generalization accuracy of the resulting
   estimator may often be increased.

   With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to
   support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes:

       * Store n output values in leaves, instead of 1;

       * Use splitting criteria that compute the average reduction across all
         n outputs.

   This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this
   strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor. If a
   decision tree is fit on an output array Y of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
   then the resulting estimator will:

       * Output n_output values upon predict;

       * Output a list of n_output arrays of class probabilities upon
         predict_proba.

   The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in
   Multi-output Decision Tree Regression. In this example, the input X is a
   single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X.

   ../_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_multioutput_001.png

   The use of multi-output trees for classification is demonstrated in Face
   completion with a multi-output estimators. In this example, the inputs X
   are the pixels of the upper half of faces and the outputs Y are the pixels
   of the lower half of those faces.

1.10.4. Complexity¶

   In general, the run time cost to construct a balanced binary tree is
   \(O(n_{samples}n_{features}\log(n_{samples}))\) and query time
   \(O(\log(n_{samples}))\). Although the tree construction algorithm
   attempts to generate balanced trees, they will not always be balanced.
   Assuming that the subtrees remain approximately balanced, the cost at each
   node consists of searching through \(O(n_{features})\) to find the feature
   that offers the largest reduction in the impurity criterion, e.g. log loss
   (which is equivalent to an information gain). This has a cost of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}\log(n_{samples}))\) at each node, leading to a
   total cost over the entire trees (by summing the cost at each node) of
   \(O(n_{features}n_{samples}^{2}\log(n_{samples}))\).

1.10.5. Tips on practical use¶

       * Decision trees tend to overfit on data with a large number of
         features. Getting the right ratio of samples to number of features
         is important, since a tree with few samples in high dimensional
         space is very likely to overfit.

       * Consider performing dimensionality reduction (PCA, ICA, or Feature
         selection) beforehand to give your tree a better chance of finding
         features that are discriminative.

       * Understanding the decision tree structure will help in gaining more
         insights about how the decision tree makes predictions, which is
         important for understanding the important features in the data.

       * Visualize your tree as you are training by using the export
         function. Use max_depth=3 as an initial tree depth to get a feel for
         how the tree is fitting to your data, and then increase the depth.

       * Remember that the number of samples required to populate the tree
         doubles for each additional level the tree grows to. Use max_depth
         to control the size of the tree to prevent overfitting.

       * Use min_samples_split or min_samples_leaf to ensure that multiple
         samples inform every decision in the tree, by controlling which
         splits will be considered. A very small number will usually mean the
         tree will overfit, whereas a large number will prevent the tree from
         learning the data. Try min_samples_leaf=5 as an initial value. If
         the sample size varies greatly, a float number can be used as
         percentage in these two parameters. While min_samples_split can
         create arbitrarily small leaves, min_samples_leaf guarantees that
         each leaf has a minimum size, avoiding low-variance, over-fit leaf
         nodes in regression problems. For classification with few classes,
         min_samples_leaf=1 is often the best choice.

         Note that min_samples_split considers samples directly and
         independent of sample_weight, if provided (e.g. a node with m
         weighted samples is still treated as having exactly m samples).
         Consider min_weight_fraction_leaf or min_impurity_decrease if
         accounting for sample weights is required at splits.

       * Balance your dataset before training to prevent the tree from being
         biased toward the classes that are dominant. Class balancing can be
         done by sampling an equal number of samples from each class, or
         preferably by normalizing the sum of the sample weights
         (sample_weight) for each class to the same value. Also note that
         weight-based pre-pruning criteria, such as min_weight_fraction_leaf,
         will then be less biased toward dominant classes than criteria that
         are not aware of the sample weights, like min_samples_leaf.

       * If the samples are weighted, it will be easier to optimize the tree
         structure using weight-based pre-pruning criterion such as
         min_weight_fraction_leaf, which ensure that leaf nodes contain at
         least a fraction of the overall sum of the sample weights.

       * All decision trees use np.float32 arrays internally. If training
         data is not in this format, a copy of the dataset will be made.

       * If the input matrix X is very sparse, it is recommended to convert
         to sparse csc_matrix before calling fit and sparse csr_matrix before
         calling predict. Training time can be orders of magnitude faster for
         a sparse matrix input compared to a dense matrix when features have
         zero values in most of the samples.

1.10.6. Tree algorithms: ID3, C4.5, C5.0 and CART¶

   What are all the various decision tree algorithms and how do they differ
   from each other? Which one is implemented in scikit-learn?

   Various decision tree algorithms Click for more details

   ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The
   algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy
   manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information
   gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and
   then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree
   to generalize to unseen data.

   C4.5 is the successor to ID3 and removed the restriction that features
   must be categorical by dynamically defining a discrete attribute (based on
   numerical variables) that partitions the continuous attribute value into a
   discrete set of intervals. C4.5 converts the trained trees (i.e. the
   output of the ID3 algorithm) into sets of if-then rules. The accuracy of
   each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be
   applied. Pruning is done by removing a rule’s precondition if the accuracy
   of the rule improves without it.

   C5.0 is Quinlan’s latest version release under a proprietary license. It
   uses less memory and builds smaller rulesets than C4.5 while being more
   accurate.

   CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is very similar to C4.5, but it
   differs in that it supports numerical target variables (regression) and
   does not compute rule sets. CART constructs binary trees using the feature
   and threshold that yield the largest information gain at each node.

   scikit-learn uses an optimized version of the CART algorithm; however, the
   scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for
   now.

1.10.7. Mathematical formulation¶

   Given training vectors \(x_i \in R^n\), i=1,…, l and a label vector \(y
   \in R^l\), a decision tree recursively partitions the feature space such
   that the samples with the same labels or similar target values are grouped
   together.

   Let the data at node \(m\) be represented by \(Q_m\) with \(n_m\) samples.
   For each candidate split \(\theta = (j, t_m)\) consisting of a feature
   \(j\) and threshold \(t_m\), partition the data into
   \(Q_m^{left}(\theta)\) and \(Q_m^{right}(\theta)\) subsets

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}Q_m^{left}(\theta) = \{(x, y) | x_j \leq
   t_m\}\\Q_m^{right}(\theta) = Q_m \setminus
   Q_m^{left}(\theta)\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   The quality of a candidate split of node \(m\) is then computed using an
   impurity function or loss function \(H()\), the choice of which depends on
   the task being solved (classification or regression)

   \[G(Q_m, \theta) = \frac{n_m^{left}}{n_m} H(Q_m^{left}(\theta)) +
   \frac{n_m^{right}}{n_m} H(Q_m^{right}(\theta))\]

   Select the parameters that minimises the impurity

   \[\theta^* = \operatorname{argmin}_\theta G(Q_m, \theta)\]

   Recurse for subsets \(Q_m^{left}(\theta^*)\) and \(Q_m^{right}(\theta^*)\)
   until the maximum allowable depth is reached, \(n_m @lt; \min_{samples}\) or
   \(n_m = 1\).

  1.10.7.1. Classification criteria¶

   If a target is a classification outcome taking on values 0,1,…,K-1, for
   node \(m\), let

   \[p_{mk} = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} I(y = k)\]

   be the proportion of class k observations in node \(m\). If \(m\) is a
   terminal node, predict_proba for this region is set to \(p_{mk}\). Common
   measures of impurity are the following.

   Gini:

   \[H(Q_m) = \sum_k p_{mk} (1 - p_{mk})\]

   Log Loss or Entropy:

   \[H(Q_m) = - \sum_k p_{mk} \log(p_{mk})\]

   Shannon entropy: Click for more details

     The entropy criterion computes the Shannon entropy of the possible
     classes. It takes the class frequencies of the training data points that
     reached a given leaf \(m\) as their probability. Using the Shannon
     entropy as tree node splitting criterion is equivalent to minimizing the
     log loss (also known as cross-entropy and multinomial deviance) between
     the true labels \(y_i\) and the probabilistic predictions \(T_k(x_i)\)
     of the tree model \(T\) for class \(k\).

     To see this, first recall that the log loss of a tree model \(T\)
     computed on a dataset \(D\) is defined as follows:

     \[\mathrm{LL}(D, T) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{(x_i, y_i) \in D} \sum_k I(y_i
     = k) \log(T_k(x_i))\]

     where \(D\) is a training dataset of \(n\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\).

     In a classification tree, the predicted class probabilities within leaf
     nodes are constant, that is: for all \((x_i, y_i) \in Q_m\), one has:
     \(T_k(x_i) = p_{mk}\) for each class \(k\).

     This property makes it possible to rewrite \(\mathrm{LL}(D, T)\) as the
     sum of the Shannon entropies computed for each leaf of \(T\) weighted by
     the number of training data points that reached each leaf:

     \[\mathrm{LL}(D, T) = \sum_{m \in T} \frac{n_m}{n} H(Q_m)\]

  1.10.7.2. Regression criteria¶

   If the target is a continuous value, then for node \(m\), common criteria
   to minimize as for determining locations for future splits are Mean
   Squared Error (MSE or L2 error), Poisson deviance as well as Mean Absolute
   Error (MAE or L1 error). MSE and Poisson deviance both set the predicted
   value of terminal nodes to the learned mean value \(\bar{y}_m\) of the
   node whereas the MAE sets the predicted value of terminal nodes to the
   median \(median(y)_m\).

   Mean Squared Error:

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\bar{y}_m = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m}
   y\\H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} (y -
   \bar{y}_m)^2\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   Half Poisson deviance:

   \[H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} (y \log\frac{y}{\bar{y}_m} - y +
   \bar{y}_m)\]

   Setting criterion="poisson" might be a good choice if your target is a
   count or a frequency (count per some unit). In any case, \(y @gt;= 0\) is a
   necessary condition to use this criterion. Note that it fits much slower
   than the MSE criterion.

   Mean Absolute Error:

   \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}median(y)_m = \underset{y \in
   Q_m}{\mathrm{median}}(y)\\H(Q_m) = \frac{1}{n_m} \sum_{y \in Q_m} |y -
   median(y)_m|\end{aligned}\end{align} \]

   Note that it fits much slower than the MSE criterion.

1.10.8. Missing Values Support¶

   DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor have built-in support for
   missing values when splitter='best' and criterion is 'gini', 'entropy’, or
   'log_loss', for classification or 'squared_error', 'friedman_mse', or
   'poisson' for regression.

   For each potential threshold on the non-missing data, the splitter will
   evaluate the split with all the missing values going to the left node or
   the right node.

   Decisions are made as follows:

       * By default when predicting, the samples with missing values are
         classified with the class used in the split found during training:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([0, 1, 6, np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X)
 array([0, 0, 1, 1])

       * If the the criterion evaluation is the same for both nodes, then the
         tie for missing value at predict time is broken by going to the
         right node. The splitter also checks the split where all the missing
         values go to one child and non-missing values go to the other:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([np.nan, -1, np.nan, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X_test = np.array([np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X_test)
 array([1])

       * If no missing values are seen during training for a given feature,
         then during prediction missing values are mapped to the child with
         the most samples:

 @gt;@gt;@gt; from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
 @gt;@gt;@gt; import numpy as np

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; y = [0, 1, 1, 1]

 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(X, y)

 @gt;@gt;@gt; X_test = np.array([np.nan]).reshape(-1, 1)
 @gt;@gt;@gt; tree.predict(X_test)
 array([1])

1.10.9. Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning¶

   Minimal cost-complexity pruning is an algorithm used to prune a tree to
   avoid over-fitting, described in Chapter 3 of [BRE]. This algorithm is
   parameterized by \(\alpha\ge0\) known as the complexity parameter. The
   complexity parameter is used to define the cost-complexity measure,
   \(R_\alpha(T)\) of a given tree \(T\):

   \[R_\alpha(T) = R(T) + \alpha|\widetilde{T}|\]

   where \(|\widetilde{T}|\) is the number of terminal nodes in \(T\) and
   \(R(T)\) is traditionally defined as the total misclassification rate of
   the terminal nodes. Alternatively, scikit-learn uses the total sample
   weighted impurity of the terminal nodes for \(R(T)\). As shown above, the
   impurity of a node depends on the criterion. Minimal cost-complexity
   pruning finds the subtree of \(T\) that minimizes \(R_\alpha(T)\).

   The cost complexity measure of a single node is
   \(R_\alpha(t)=R(t)+\alpha\). The branch, \(T_t\), is defined to be a tree
   where node \(t\) is its root. In general, the impurity of a node is
   greater than the sum of impurities of its terminal nodes, \(R(T_t)@lt;R(t)\).
   However, the cost complexity measure of a node, \(t\), and its branch,
   \(T_t\), can be equal depending on \(\alpha\). We define the effective
   \(\alpha\) of a node to be the value where they are equal,
   \(R_\alpha(T_t)=R_\alpha(t)\) or
   \(\alpha_{eff}(t)=\frac{R(t)-R(T_t)}{|T|-1}\). A non-terminal node with
   the smallest value of \(\alpha_{eff}\) is the weakest link and will be
   pruned. This process stops when the pruned tree’s minimal \(\alpha_{eff}\)
   is greater than the ccp_alpha parameter.

                                   tree (n.)

   Old English treo, treow "tree" (also "timber, wood, beam, log, stake"),
   from Proto-Germanic *trewam (source also of Old Frisian tre, Old Saxon
   trio, Old Norse tre, Gothic triu "tree"), from PIE *drew-o-, suffixed
   variant form of root *deru- "be firm, solid, steadfast," with specialized
   senses "wood, tree" and derivatives referring to objects made of wood.

     The line which divides trees from shrubs is largely arbitrary, and
     dependent upon habit rather than size, the tree having a single trunk
     usually unbranched for some distance above the ground, while a shrub has
     usually several stems from the same root and each without a proper
     trunk. [Century Dictionary]

   In Old English and Middle English also "thing made of wood," especially
   the cross of the Crucifixion and a gallows (such as Tyburn tree, famous
   gallows outside London). Middle English also had plural treen, adjective
   treen (Old English treowen "of a tree, wooden"). For Dutch boom, German
   Baum, the usual words for "tree," see beam (n.).

   The meaning "framework of a saddle" is from 1530s. The meaning
   "representation of familial relationships in the form of a tree" is from
   c. 1300. Tree-hugger, contemptuous for "environmentalist" is attested by
   1989.

     Minc'd Pyes do not grow upon every tree,

     But search the Ovens for them, and there they be.

     ["Poor Robin," Almanack, 1669]

   tree (v.)

   "to chase up a tree," 1700, from tree (n.). Meaning "take a tree-like
   form" is from 1884. Related: Treed; treeing.

   also from 1700

   beam (n.)

   Old English beam, "living tree," but by late 10c. also "rafter, post,
   ship's timber," from Proto-Germanic *baumaz "tree" (source also of Old
   Frisian bam "tree, gallows, beam," Middle Dutch boom, Old High German
   boum, German Baum "tree," and perhaps also (with unexplained sound
   changes) Old Norse baðmr, Gothic bagms). This is of uncertain etymology
   (according to Boutkan probably a substrate word). The shift from *-au- to
   -ea- is regular in Old English.

   The meaning "ray of light" developed in Old English, probably because beam
   was used by Bede to render Latin columna (lucis), the Biblical "pillar of
   fire." The meaning "directed flow of radiation" is from 1906. To be on the
   beam "going in the right direction" (1941) originally was an aviator's
   term for "to follow the course indicated by a radio beam."

   The nautical sense of "one of the horizontal transverse timbers holding a
   ship together" is from early 13c., hence "greatest breadth of a ship," and
   slang broad in the beam, by 1894 of ships; of persons, "wide-hipped," by
   1938.

   *deru- 

   also *dreu-, Proto-Indo-European root meaning "be firm, solid, steadfast,"
   with specialized senses "wood," "tree" and derivatives referring to
   objects made of wood.

Toledo man left paralyzed after tree trimming accident speaks out for the first
                          time in exclusive interview

   Matt Thieman and his brother Tony were cutting down a tree in their
   mother’s Toledo yard on Dec. 16.
   By Carli Petrus
   Published: Jan. 4, 2024 at 6:44 AM EST

   TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - A local tree trimmer speaking out for the very first
   time after he was left paralyzed in a freak accident just a few weeks ago.

   Matt Thieman says he and his brother Tony were cutting down a tree in
   their mother’s Toledo yard on December 16, 2023, when a dead limb fell and
   crushed his body.

   “The speed of the log coming, it was just, there wasn’t enough time to get
   out of the way, and it was enough to smash me head to toe to the ground,”
   said Thieman. “I covered my head and it smashed right through my arm and
   busted everything up.”

   With more than 20 years in the tree trimming business, Thieman says this
   was never supposed to happen.

   “I just remember that we were using rope, doing everything correctly,
   having it tied off.”

   Now laying in a rehab center, paralyzed from the chest down he says all he
   can do is just take it day by day.

   “I’m rolling with the punches and trying to find my way through,” Thieman
   said.

   He believes the outpour of support from loved ones is helping him stay
   positive. Even strangers are reaching out to lend a helping hand.

   A 13 Action News viewer donated his late wife’s barely used electric
   wheelchair to Thieman after seeing the original story about the accident.

   “When I saw the article it just had to go, it had to go to him,” said the
   viewer who wished to stay anonymous.

   Although the road to recovery for Thieman will be a long one, he says he
   is choosing to take the high road.

What Is a Tree?

   Trees grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment. Like all plants,
   trees manufacture their food through photosynthesis. Trees are in the
   family of woody plants which have cambium, a special layer of cells that
   allow the tree to increase in girth and are self supporting with a single
   stem. Trees are perennials and can live for many years. The oldest known
   tree species is the Great Basin bristlecone pine, which is believed to
   reach ages of over 5,000 years old!

   Food for trees is produced through a complex system starting with the
   leaves. Leaves produce sugar as a result of photosynthesis which combines
   carbon dioxide and sunlight. The by-product of photosynthesis that Trees
   produce is oxygen—a vital resource for other living organisms. Sugar that
   is produced runs down through the tree, under the bark down the trunk and
   to the roots of the tree. The sugar combines at the roots with minerals
   and water in the ground to move back up the tree trunk and under the bark
   back to the leaves to which starts the cycle of photosynthesis again.
   Along the way, minerals, water and sugar stimulate the growth and
   development of the tree or assist in its reproduction.

Tree Types

   Trees can divided into two categories: deciduous and coniferous.

   Deciduous trees are also known as broadleaf trees because the leaves are
   generally larger and wider than those of conifers. The larger leaf size
   means a greater surface area for photosynthesis, but it also means the
   leaf is too fragile to withstand winter conditions. Therefore, most
   deciduous trees drop their leaves in autumn.

   Coniferous trees keep their leaves throughout the year, shedding only the
   oldest leaves. Usually these leaves are lower down on the tree and do not
   receive as much sunlight as newly developed leaves higher up. Some of the
   best-known members of the conifer family are pines, spruces, firs, and
   hemlocks. The cones of the conifers are its flowers.

Parts of a Tree

   Tree parts diagram showing crown, leaves, branch, trunk, root collar, and
   roots

   The crown of the tree is made up of the leaves and branches.

   The trunk of the tree supports the crown and serves as a highway for food
   made in the leaves to travel to the roots and for water and nutrients from
   the roots to travel to the leaves.

   The root collar is located at the base of the trunk just above where the
   roots join. Also called the root flare, due to the flared shape on some
   tree species, the root collar must always remain above ground when
   planting and mulching.

   The roots of the tree support the trunk and crown, and also anchor the
   tree in the soil. They serve as a storage facility during the winter for
   the food produced by the leaves during the growing season. The roots also
   absorb water and nutrients from the soil for use by the tree.

   Many wildlife species depend on trees for food, water, cover, or places to
   raise their young. You can help wildlife by planting trees and creating
   habitat in your community!

   tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most
   plants classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing
   woody tissues, and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs,
   called branches.

   To many, the word tree evokes images of such ancient, powerful, and
   majestic structures as oaks and sequoias, the latter being among the most
   massive and longest-living organisms in the world. Although the majority
   of Earth’s terrestrial biomass is represented by trees, the fundamental
   importance of these seemingly ubiquitous plants for the very existence and
   diversity of life on Earth is perhaps not fully appreciated. The biosphere
   is dependent on the metabolism, death, and recycling of plants, especially
   trees. Their vast trunks and root systems store carbon dioxide, move
   water, and produce oxygen that is released into the atmosphere. The
   organic matter of the soil develops primarily from decayed leaves, twigs,
   branches, roots, and fallen trees, all of which recycle nitrogen, carbon,
   oxygen, and other important nutrients. There are few organisms as
   important as trees for maintaining Earth’s ecology.

   This article discusses the historical, popular, and botanical
   classifications of trees, their evolution, their importance to humans, and
   their general structure and patterns of growth. For more information on
   the three botanical groups that include trees, see fern (e.g., the tree
   ferns), gymnosperm (including conifers), and angiosperm (the flowering
   plants). For general information on plants, see plant.

Classification of trees

   The ancient Greeks developed a classification about 300 bce in which
   plants were grouped according to their general form—that is, as trees,
   shrubs, undershrubs, and vines. This classification was used for almost
   1,000 years. Modern classifications of plants attempt to assign a plant to
   a particular taxon and establish relationships with other plants based on
   genetics, cytology, ecology, behaviour, and probable evolutionary
   lineages, in addition to gross morphology. Popular classifications,
   however, remain useful tools for studying the common stresses that the
   environment exerts on all plants and the general patterns of adaptation
   that are shown no matter how distantly plants are related.

Phylogenetic classifications

   Trees are represented in each of the major groups of the vascular plants:
   pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants that include the tree ferns),
   gymnosperms (cycads, ginkgoes, and conifers), and angiosperms (flowering
   plants).

   Although tree ferns account for only a small percentage of ferns, many are
   conspicuous members of a forest, attaining heights of 7 to 10 metres (23
   to 33 feet); some are 15, 18, or occasionally 24 metres tall (49, 59, or
   79 feet). These graceful trees, which are natives of humid montane forests
   in the tropics and subtropics and of warm temperate regions of the
   Southern Hemisphere, have huge lacy leaves; they are the remnants of a
   vastly more numerous flora that populated much of Earth during the
   Carboniferous Period (about 358.9 to 298.9 million years ago).

   Cycads compose the Cycadophyta, a division of gymnospermous plants
   consisting of 4 families and approximately 140 species. Natives of warm
   regions of the Eastern and Western hemispheres, they also are remnants of
   a much larger number of species that in past geologic ages dominated
   Earth’s flora.

   ancient Buddhist temples in China and planted elsewhere as an ornamental
   since the mid-18th century; the tree probably no longer exists in a wild
   state.

   Conifers (division Pinophyta) are the largest group of gymnosperms and
   include trees and shrubs in 7 extant families and 545 species. Familiar
   representatives are araucarias, cedars, cypresses, Douglas firs, firs,
   hemlocks, junipers, larches, pines, podocarps, redwoods, spruces, and
   yews.

   Dominating Earth’s present flora are the angiosperms, with about 300,000
   species, among which are the majority of the world’s trees. Angiosperms
   are sometimes divided on the basis of a group of characteristics into two
   major groups: the monocotyledons and the eudicotyledons. The most numerous
   of the monocotyledonous trees are palms; others include agaves, aloes,
   dracaenas, screw pines, and yuccas. By far the greatest number of tree
   species are eudicotyledons; they are represented by such familiar groups
   as birches, elms, hollies, maples, oaks, poplars, ashes, and willows.

Ecological and evolutionary classification

   The tree is not an immutable biological category but rather a human
   concept based on visual criteria. Perhaps a general definition would
   describe a tree as a perennial woody plant that develops along a single
   main trunk to a height of at least 4.5 metres (15 feet) at maturity. This
   may be contrasted with a shrub, which might be loosely defined as a woody
   plant with multiple stems that is, in most cases, less than 3 metres
   (about 10 feet) tall. However, a species fitting the description of either
   in one area of the world might not necessarily do so in other regions,
   since a variety of stresses shape the habit of the mature plant. Thus, a
   given woody species may be a tree in one set of habitats within its range
   and a shrub elsewhere. For example, the spruce and fir may thrive in the
   tree form at the base of a mountain but assume a shrub form near the
   mountaintop, the variation due principally to stresses exerted by such
   environmental conditions as altitude, temperature, and oxygen tension.

   As seen in the section above, trees are found among many plant families
   that also include shrubs and herbs, so that the concept of tree is not a
   phylogenetic one. Further, there is no clear consensus as to whether the
   tree form is the advanced or primitive condition. Some paleobotanists
   suggest that trees are the most primitive members within these plant
   families. However, tree forms are found in all the vascular plants, from
   the club mosses and ferns to the gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is
   furthermore true that, among the flowering plants, trees are found not
   only among the most primitive members (order Magnoliales) but also among
   the more specialized, or advanced, members, such as the roses (order
   Rosales).

   Consequently, from both a taxonomic and a phylogenetic perspective, the
   tree is an artificial category. On an ecological basis, however, the tree
   can be recognized as a natural construct, as it represents an adaptive
   strategy by many different taxa to exploit and dominate the habitat above
   the ground.

   In the early stages of the development of terrestrial life, land plants
   were rootless and leafless. Since they had their origins in aqueous
   environments, they did not require the specialized conducting and
   supporting tissues afforded by roots and stems, nor did they require
   localized regions of carbohydrate synthesis, since each cell was involved
   in metabolism, water and nutrient absorption, and respiration. Habitats
   farther from the water as well as aerial habitats represented available
   uninhabited environments.

   One key to exploiting terrestrial habitats is increasing complexity of the
   plant’s form to allow specialization of function. This requires
   physiological and morphological complexity as well as biological
   optimization. If all the tissues of massive tree trunks were alive, for
   example, the physiological cost of maintaining these structures in the
   living state would be enormous and probably unattainable. An elegant
   solution came in the form of tremendous structural adaptations: new
   tissues and organs permitted localization of the functions of the plant
   body.

   The evolution of discrete plant body parts with separate functions allowed
   plants to move onto the land and undergo an incredible adaptive radiation.
   Leaves evolved as specialized photosynthetic organs. Stems provided
   mechanical strength as well as a conductive capacity to transport water
   and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Roots provided anchorage and
   absorption of sufficient water and nutrients to support the remainder of
   the plant.

                       What is a Tree? How Does it Work?

   Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, the usually wider
   and thinner-walled layer, called springwood, grows. In the summer, a
   thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
   typical in temperate forest trees.

Tree Physiology

     * A tree is a tall plant with woody tissue. Trees gather light for
       photosynthesis through their leaves; this process creates “food” for
       the tree.
     * Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and serves only to support the
       weight of the tree crown. The outside layers of the tree trunk are the
       only living portion. The cambium produces new wood and new bark.
     * The band of tissue outside of the cambium is the phloem. Phloem
       transports new materials (the sugars created from photosynthesis) from
       the crown to the roots. Dead phloem tissue becomes the bark of a tree.
     * The band of tissue just inside of the cambium is the xylem, which
       transports water from the roots to the crown. Dead xylem tissue forms
       the heartwood, or the wood we use for many different purposes.
     * Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, usually a
       wider and thinner-walled layer called springwood forms. In the summer,
       a thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
       typical in temperate forest trees.

Parts of a Tree

     * Leaves – broadleaf or needles; primary location for photosynthesis and
       production of hormones and other chemicals.
     * Twigs and Branches – support structures for leaves, flowers and
       fruits.
     * Crown – the upper part of the tree composed of leaves, twigs,
       branches, flowers and fruit.
     * Flowers – the site of reproduction. Trees can be male, female or both.
       Conifers, however, do not have petals and typical flower structures.
     * Fruits and Seeds – all trees have seeds, most are inside of the fruit.
     * Trunk – generally a single “stem,” but can be multiple-stemmed. Main
       functions are materials transport and support.
     * Bark – main function is to protect the living tissue called cambium
       from damage.
     * Roots – two main functions: (1) collect nutrients and water and (2)
       anchor the tree.

Trees Grow:

     * At the twig tips (apical meristem)
     * At the root tips (root apical meristem)
     * At the cambium (old xylem cells become heartwood, old phloem cells
       become bark)

Why do Leaves Change Color in the Fall?

   Chlorophyll production goes down as night length increases (fall and
   winter). The green colors are no longer reflected and other chemicals in
   the leaf become dominant, revealing red and yellow pigments.

   Weather during the period of declining chlorophyll production influences
   intensity of colors.

     * Warm fall weather generally reduces color quality.
     * Moist soils following a good growing season contribute to greater
       color intensity.
     * A few warm, sunny days and cool nights increase brilliance.
     * Drought usually results in poorer displays.

   Leaves fall in autumn as part of a tree’s preparation for winter dormancy.
   Because it is too cold for water to remain in the plant tissues (freezing
   water would rupture cells in the tree), and because the water in the soil
   is frozen and cannot be absorbed, trees shut down major processes in the
   cold months. Deciduous trees drop their leaves; conifers have strategies
   to maintain their needles during the winter.

   Two women had a lucky escape after a large tree, toppled by Storm Elin,
   fell onto their car in Lincolnshire.

   Photographer Duncan Young took pictures of the scene in Waltham Road,
   Brigsley near Grimsby, on Sunday.

   CCTV, seen by the BBC, showed the tree came down at about 20:30 GMT on
   Saturday, as much of the country was drenched and battered by the storm.

   Both women were left "shaken but unharmed" by their ordeal, Mr Young said.

   The CCTV shows the car going around a bend and avoiding a branch that had
   fallen in the road before coming to a halt.

   A split second later, the tree fell onto the car, with a large branch
   resting on the shattered windscreen.

   North East Lincolnshire Council confirmed the road would be closed for

   "throughout the night" to deal with a number of fallen trees.

   They added: "We would like to thank all our colleagues who have been
   called out throughout the night, working in extremely high winds and rain
   to make the area safe."

   Citazioni sugli alberi.

Citazioni[modifica]

     * Abbiamo un'esplicita affinità – una parola che deriva dal latino
       affinis, indicante una relazione acquisita per matrimonio – con gli
       alberi. Nonostante non apparteniamo alla stessa famiglia, gli alberi e
       gli uomini sono in un certo senso sposati tra le proprie famiglie, con
       tutte le sfide, le responsabilità e i benefici che possono derivare
       dall'essere così connessi. Ci siamo evoluti con gli alberi fin dalle
       prime tracce della comparsa dell'uomo. Le nostre mani sono in grado di
       afferrare le cose, i pollici opponobili e la visione binoculare un
       tempo ci permettevano di saltare tra i rami con facilità, nonostante
       ora usiamo queste doti per altri scopi, come giocare a baseball o
       farci strada nel traffico. Il prezzo esorbitante degli attici riflette
       il nostro desiderio di spaziare con lo sguardo sul territorio, un
       desiderio nato nelle savane della nostra culla evolutiva costellate di
       alberi. (Nalini Nadkarni)
     * Albero (s.m.). Pianta di forma allungata di cui la natura ci ha
       provveduti nella sua generosità, perché potessimo servircene come
       strumento di pena. (Ambrose Bierce)
     * Anche gli alberi hanno la loro anima che è in fondo, il demone stesso
       della vegetazione (come lo sono gli spiriti antropomorfici o i re di
       maggio, le cui gare o processioni si inverano, appunto, nel
       conducimento e nel seppellimento dello spirito dell'albero). (Giuseppe
       Cocchiara)
     * Anche gli alberi sgomitano per un po' di sole. (Caparezza)
     * Come gli dèi, anche gli alberi muoiono: gli uni e gli altri sono le
       creature più delicate e feribili del mondo; e noi dobbiamo assistere
       alla loro malattia e alla loro morte. (Pietro Citati)
     * Con il legno | l’uomo fa le porte, | Dio gli alberi. (Lillo Gullo)
     * Credo che non vedrò mai una poesia bella come un albero. Ma le poesie
       le fanno gli sciocchi come me. Un albero lo può fare solamente Dio.
       (Joyce Kilmer)
     * Gli alberi li piantavamo per i morti, ma in guerra sono serviti ai
       vivi. Durante l'assedio di Sarajevo scomparivano gli alberi e si
       estendevano i cimiteri. Per riscaldarsi, quando ormai si erano
       esaurite tutte le altre risorse, la gente tagliava gli alberi nei
       parchi e nei cimiteri. I più audaci, o i più disperati, segavano gli
       alberi sulle colline, e sui pendii dei monti vicini, talvolta a solo
       una decina di metri di distanza dalla linea del fronte (Azra
       Nuhefendić)
     * Gli alberi sono forse i soli che conoscono a fondo il mistero
       dell'acqua. (Jules Renard)
     * Gli alberi sono liriche che la terra scrive sul cielo. Noi li
       abbattiamo e li trasformiamo in carta per potervi registrare, invece,
       la nostra vuotaggine. (Khalil Gibran)
     * Il mito però non riconosce nell'albero solo un simbolo della vita ma
       anche del cosmo. Con le radici affondate nel terreno promordiale,
       dischiudendo la sua fioritura nell'universo, genera stelle e soli. Qui
       il padre e la madre sono uniti in eterno splendore. È il legno della
       vita al centro della città eterna in cui ancora non vi sono divisioni
       né luoghi sacri. Anche il frassino Yggrasil, all'ombra del quale ogni
       giorno si riuniscono gli dèi per tenere consiglio, non deve morire con
       loro: sopravvive oltre il tramonto. (Ernst Jünger)
     * Il potere reale è come un grande albero frondoso; se gli spunti la
       cima o gli tagli i rami più grossi, e gli lasci stare gli altri rami e
       la radice, crescerà ancora e riprenderà nuova forza. (Gerrard
       Winstanley)
     * Il segreto è fare come gli alberi, | prima cerchi, dopo tronchi.
       (Caparezza)
     * In realtà sono le anime degli alberi che noi vediamo in inverno. In
       estate tutto è verde e idilliaco ma in inverno sono soltanto i rami e
       i tronchi ad esaltare. (Nymphomaniac)
     * – In realtà sono le anime degli alberi che noi vediamo d'inverno.
       – Penso che assomiglino a quelle umane.
       – Sì, hai ragione. Assomigliano alle anime umane: anime contorte,
       anime normali, anime pazze, dipendono tutte dal tipo di vita che gli
       esseri umani conducono. [...] Ho trovato il mio albero, quello della
       mia anima. Eccolo, è questo qui.
       – Non è un frassino.
       – No, è una quercia.
       – Mio padre trovò l'albero della sua anima ma io non ho mai trovato il
       mio. «Lo saprai quando lo vedrai» mi diceva. (Nymphomaniac)
     * In tempi passati, alberi e uomini erano buoni amici. (Il mio vicino
       Totoro)
     * Insieme con l'acqua l'albero è il simbolo della creazione.
       Nessun'altra forma rappresenta la vita quanto lui. Le radici aspirano
       l'humus. Il tronco ne è l'asse. I rami sono l'espansione, il dominio
       della sfera terrestre. Fogli e fiori solidali alla luce sono forze
       imponderabili. (Ignácio de Loyola Brandão)
     * Io sono dei vostri, alberi, sono dei vostri | animali eleganti, io
       sono dei vostri. Credetelo. | Sono dei vostri. Ci separa soltanto un
       fiato infantile, | ma lo so, lo so, sono io tutto quel | manto, sono
       io il tronco e lo storno e il | falco. Ci separa un niente, colore,
       capello, | piccolo piccolo nome: l'impianto del | respiro è solo
       apparente diverso. (Mariangela Gualtieri)
     * L'albero sembra | un cane intento a | ringhiare verso i Cieli. (Jack
       Kerouac)
     * L'evocazione degli alberi, della loro maestosità indifferente e
       dell'amore che proviamo per loro da un lato ci insegna quanto siamo
       insignificanti, cattivi parassiti brulicanti sulla superficie
       terrestre, dall'altro invece quanto siamo degni di vivere, perché
       siamo capaci di riconoscere una bellezza che non ci è debitrice.
       (Muriel Barbery)
     * L'uomo è come un albero e in ogni suo inverno levita la primavera che
       reca nuove foglie e nuovo vigore. (Vasco Pratolini)
     * La condotta dell'uomo dovrebbe ispirarsi a un albero. Il tronco è
       radicato, i rami sono liberi di agitarsi nel vento. (Ip Man - The
       Final Fight)
     * La gioventù va via presto sulla terra, figuratevi sugli alberi, donde
       tutto è destinato a cadere: foglie, frutti. (Italo Calvino)
     * Mi piacciono gli alberi, sono segno di forza e di grandezza, si
       innalzano verso il cielo. Hanno una vita lunga: c'erano e ci saranno
       prima e dopo di noi. Ci sopravvivono. E così mi sdraio in veranda e
       ascolto la brezza che muove appena le fronde. Un suono meraviglioso
       che solo la vita e la natura ti sanno dare. (Arrigo Sacchi)
     * Nelle foreste c'era un albero | Ed era proprio un bell'albero ||
       Sull'albero c'era un ramo | Sul ramo c'era un fuscello | Sul fuscello
       c'era un nido | In quel nido c'era un uovo | Nell'uovo c'era un
       uccello | E da quell'uccello venne una piuma | E da quella piuma venne
       | Un letto || E su quel letto c'era una ragazza | E su quella ragazza
       c'era un uomo | E da quell'uomo venne un seme | E da quel seme venne
       un bambino | E da quel bambino venne un uomo | E per quell'uomo c'era
       una tomba | E su quella tomba crebbe | Un albero (The Wicker Man)
     * Perché vi sono alberi sotto i quali non posso passare senza che vasti
       e melodiosi pensieri non scendano su di me? | (Ritengo che pendano da
       quegli alberi, d'estate come d'inverno, e facciano sempre cadere
       frutti sul mio passaggio). (Walt Whitman)
     * Pianta alberi, che gioveranno in un altro tempo. (Marco Porcio Catone)
     * Più antico è un albero, più tra le sue fronde e nelle cavità possono
       abitare capinere, passeri, tortore, storni, scoiattoli, insetti. Salvo
       casi di emergenza, da metà marzo fino a conclusione dell'autunno non
       bisognerebbe tagliarne nemmeno una fronda. Non solo sono i mesi della
       piena vegetazione, ma pure quelli in cui uccelli, insetti, piccoli
       mammiferi, già logorati dall'urbanizzazione, depongono le uova e
       partoriscono le cucciolate. (Margherita D'Amico)
     * Rustiche frenesie, sogni fioriti, | deliri vegetabili odorosi, |
       capricci de' giardin, Protei frondosi, | e di ameno furor impazziti,
       || quasi piante di Cadmo amano arditi | a l'Autunno guerrier tornei
       selvosi; | o di Pomona adulteri giocosi | fan nascere nel suol mostri
       mentiti. || Vedi zampe di tigri e ceffi d'orso | e chimere di serpi; e
       se l'addenti, | quasi ne temi il tocco e fuggi il morso. || Altri in
       larve di Lemuri frementi | arruffano di corna orrido il dorso, | e fan
       cibo e diletto anco i spaventi. (Giacomo Lubrano)
     * Sapranno tutti gli alberi della foresta | che io sono il Signore, |
       che umilio l'albero alto e innalzo l'albero basso; | faccio seccare
       l'albero verde e germogliare l'albero secco. (Libro di Ezechiele)
     * Se un albero scrivesse l'autobiografia, non sarebbe diversa dalla
       storia di un popolo. (Khalil Gibran)
     * So che gli alberi mi guardano, mi curano e mi proteggono con la loro
       presenza silenziosa, col loro amore senza parole. Non sanno nulla di
       me, ma sono disposti a distendere le loro braccia sopra di me e sopra
       ciascuno. (Pietro Citati)
     * Sotto la terra ci sono le tenebre, riposa la profonda oscurità. Come
       prima della creazione del mondo... Sopra la terra c'è la luce.
       L'albero è l'unione di questii due mondi. Porta la luce al vuoto
       tenebroso. Porta, al fondo della terra, l'aria di cui necessita per
       ricostruirsi e fornire la vita. (Ignácio de Loyola Brandão)
     * Un albero giovane che non abbia ancora profonde radici, può con
       facilità sterparsi; bisogna usar la scure chi lo lasci ingrossare.
       (Confucio)

                         Alberi: tipi, specie e varietà

   Articolo realizzato dalla redazione
   Informazioni sulla redazione

   Gli alberi possono definirsi piante perenni, ossia che vivono più di due
   anni, formati da un tronco legnoso, dalle radici e dalla chioma. A parte
   le distinzioni botaniche gli alberi possono classificarsi in vario modo.
   Scopriamo quanti e quali tipi di alberi esistono e come vengono suddivisi
   in botanica.

Caratteristiche degli alberi.

   Gli alberi sono piante perenni, ossia che vivono più di due anni, formati
   da:

     * un tronco legnoso, che serve a sostenere la pianta e contenere i vasi
       in cui circola il nutrimento che dalla radice passa alle foglie,
     * radici che servono ad ancorare la pianta al terreno ed ad assorbire
       acqua e sali minerali per il nutrimento
     * chioma che si compone di rami e foglie che fabbricano il cibo per la
       pianta a partire dalla linfa grezza ricevuta dalle radici, grazie
       della fotosintesi clorofilliana.

   Si differiscono dagli arbusti perchè hanno un tronco alto da cui si
   sviluppano i rami lontani dal terreno.

   In natura esistono moltissimi tipi di alberi che si suole dividere in tre
   grandi categorie:

     * forestali che comprendono le specie spontanee e quelle coltivate
       utilizzate per la produzione del legno. Tali alberi si possono a loro
       volta suddividere in base alle aree geografiche in cui crescono ed
       abbiamo:
     *    * alberi mediterranei che comprendono moltissime specie adatte a
            vivere in zone climatiche mediterranee con inverni miti e piogge
            moderate. Gli alberi più caratteristici sono il Leccio, l'Olivo,
            il Castagno, il Pino, il Biancospino, l'Acero, il sughero.
          * collinari: che crescono fino a circa 1000 m di altezza: faggi,
            querce, castagni.
          * montani: che crescono tra i 1000 a fino oltre 3000 m di altezza:
            abete, larice, betulla, pino
          * tropicali che vivono bene con inverni miti e umidità elevata,
            come l’annona, il noce,il mango, il banano, la papaya, il baobab,
            le palme le sequoia ecc..

     * Ornamentali che hanno una funzione estetica, infatti vengono
       utilizzati per giardini, parchi o viali e possono avere, a seconda
       della specie dimensioni varie.

   Puoi approfondire le varietà di alberi ornamentali.

   Varietà più rappresentative di alberi ornamentali: 
     * Yucca

   Inoltre poiché gli alberi si riproducono attraverso i semi in base ad essi
   che si può fare un’altra suddivisione in 2 grandi gruppi: Angiosperme e
   gimnosperme.

   Le angiosperme o a seme protetto dal frutto sono le specie più diffuse.
   Esse hanno grandezze variabili e possono raggiungere più di cento metri di
   altezza Crescono in ogni ambiente dal clima temperato a quello desertico.

   Le angiosperme si suddividono in:

     * Dicotiledoni che sono alberi a fiore in cui l'embrione è fornito di
       due cotiledoni (foglie embrionali).
     * Monocotiledoni che sono tutte piante erbacee con fiori molto
       complessi.

   Varietà più rappresentative di angiosperme: 
     * Salice                                  
     * Pioppo

   Le gimnosperme o a seme nudo cioè non protetto dal frutto. Le gimnosperme
   a loro volta sono classificate in quattro classi: 

     * le cicadine, di cui sono note 140 specie, sono piante tropicali e
       subtropicali simili a palme,
     * Le ginkgofite sono rappresentate da un unico genere con una sola
       specie, Ginkgo biloba
     * Le conifere sono le gimnosperme più diffuse, con circa 600 specie di
       piante Il loro nome significa portatrici di coni o pigne in cui si
       sviluppano i semi.
     * Le gnetofite che comprendono tre famiglie di piante legnose: le
       Ephedraceae, Gnetaceae e Welwitschiaceae.

Classificazione botanica degli alberi: la tassonomia.

   Qualsiasi sia la tipologia, gli alberi vengono classificati da una scienza
   detta tassonomia che li divide in gruppi sempre più ristretti di
   esemplari.

   La tassonomia è una scienza molto complessa e non tutti non tutti gli
   studiosi concordano su certe classificazioni, per cui per semplicità ci
   limitiamo ad esaminare le suddivisioni di maggiore interesse:

     * famiglia che indica un gruppo di piante con alcune caratteristiche
       generali;

   Principali famiglie di alberi:                                      
     * Cicadacee suddivise in 10 generi                                
     * Ginkgoaceae suddivise in sette generi, sei dei quali estinti:   
     * Pinaceae suddivise in 11 generi                                 
     * Cupressaceae suddivise in circa 30 generi,                      
     * Magnoliaceae suddivise in circa 7 generi                        
     * Platanaceae che comprendono un unico genere                     
     * Ulmaceae suddivise in circa 8 generi                            
     * Juglandaceae suddivise in circa 9 generi                        
     * Fagacee suddivise in circa 7 generi                             
     * Betulaceae suddivise in circa 8 generi                          

     * Genere indica un gruppo di piante con caratteri comuni che
       appartengono ad una stessa famiglia;

   Principali generi di alberi: 
     * Cycas comprende Ginko    
     * Abies                    
     * Cedrus                   
     * Larix                    
     * Picea                    
     * Pinus                    
     * Cupressus                
     * Sequoia                  
     * Magnolia                 
     * Platanus                 
     * Ulmus                    
     * Juglans (noce)           
     * Castanea                 
     * Fagus                    
     * Quercus                  
     * Betula                   
     * Corylus (nocciolo)       

     * Specie indica un tipo specifico di alberi che hanno stessi caratteri
       essenziali e danno origine alberi che mantengono le stesse
       caratteristiche,appartenenti ad un dato genere. Se ne contano circa
       450.000
     * Varietà e cultivar indica le variazioni che avvengono in una stessa
       specie per effetto dell'adattamento naturale o dell'intervento umano.

Classificazione non botanica degli alberi.

   A parte le distinzioni botaniche, conseguenza delle caratteristiche
   intrinseche, gli alberi sono oggetto di svariate classificazioni.

   A secondo della forma e dimensione delle foglie possiamo distinguere
   alberi:

     * aghifoglie, come si evince dal nome, presentano foglie ad aghi. Si
       identificano in genere con le conifere che sono piante sempreverdi, in
       quanto gli aghi si rinnovano di continuo e l’albero è sempre ricoperto
       di foglie.
     * Latifoglie presentano foglie grandi, a prescindere dalla forma. Le
       tipologie delle foglie possono essere varie ed in genere sono caduche,
       ovvero cadono ogni anno in autunno e crescono in primavera.

   Approfondisci quali sono gli alberi latifoglie.

   A secondo di particolari requisiti quali longevità dimensioni o rarità
   possiamo distinguere alberi:

     * alberi secolari e millenari. Sono moltissime le specie di alberi che
       vivono più di cento anni, e molti sono gli alberi millenari. Tra le
       specie che superano i 100 anni di vita vi sono le querce e l’olivo.Tra
       gli alberi millenari ricordiamo le sequoia, il pinus longaeva, il
       Ginkgo biloba, il Castagno.
     * Alberi monumentali e rari: sono alberi che detengono un primato per le
       dimensioni, per longevità, per forma particolare o perchè legati ad
       eventi storici.

   A seconda delle caratteristiche del tronco abbiamo:

     * alberi ad alto fusto, sono quelli il cui fusto ha una altezza
       superiore ai tre metri, come il noce, la quercia, il castagno, il
       pino, il cipresso, ecc..
     * Alberi a basso fusto, quelli il cui fusto non supera i tre metri come
       la magnolia, il salice o l’acacia.
     * Alberi frangivento, sono specie al alto, medio e basso fusto che
       vengono disposti in filare, per creare una barriera contro il vento
       sia per proteggere le colture che per scopi architettonici. Per
       svolgere tale funzione le piante devono avere un solido apparato
       radicale ed una crescita rapida, le specie più utilizzate sono: il
       cipresso, il pioppo e l’eucalipto.

                    I vari tipi di alberi della val Tassaro

   Marc

     Un modo divertente per riconoscere meglio gli alberi durante una bella
     passeggiata nella Val Tassaro.

   La diversità di ambienti nella valle crea le condizioni favorevoli alla
   presenza di specie vegetali che in altri contesti geografici sono
   distribuite su superfici assai più vaste. Nella valle, accanto ad antichi
   esemplari di Faggio, tipico dei boschi dell’alto appennino, si incontra il
   Pino silvestre, specie caratteristica del basso colle. Tra questi due
   estremi, si incontra una grande varietà di altre specie.

Riconoscere gli alberi

   Questa pagina è una introduzione agli alberi della Val Tassaro con la
   quale è possibile riconoscere una decina di alberi guardando: le foglie,
   il tronco, la forma, i fiori ed i frutti o i semi.

   Durante l’estate e l’autunno è sicuramente più facile riconoscere gli
   alberi che durante l’inverno quando le foglie sono cadute. La forma delle
   foglie è probabilmente la caratteristica più importante per
   l’identificazione. Durante la primavera i fiori danno preziosi indizi per
   riconoscere l’albero, seguito dalla crescita dei frutti e i semi.

Pino Silvestre

   È una pianta colonizzatrice con poche pretese nei riguardi del terreno e
   della necessità di acqua. È una specie adattabile che preferisce terreni
   calcarei ma tollera anche terreni argillosi, resiste al freddo
   (microterma) ed al secco. Cresce solitamente a quote comprese tra i 500 e
   1400 metri.

    Il pane d’api

   Dopo che le bottinatrici hanno raccolto il polline dai fiori e lo hanno

   Durante questa fermentazione avvengono una serie di processi che
   contribuiscono alla trasformazione del polline in pane d'api e alla sua

Riconoscere gli alberi

   riconoscere alberi Ti piacerebbe sapere il nome degli alberi? 

   L’albero è un essere vivente e, proprio come noi, nasce, cresce, si nutre,
   si riproduce, si ammala, invecchia, muore.
   Appartiene al regno dei vegetali, insieme alle erbe e agli arbusti.
   Ogni albero ha un fusto legnoso, un sistema di radici, rami, foglie e
   produce fiori, frutti, semi. Ma esistono moltissime specie di alberi che ,
   così come le specie degli animali, si differenziano dalle altre in
   moltissime caratteristiche: la forma della foglia, il colore della
   corteccia, la sagoma, il portamento…
   Inoltre ogni specie di albero produce un seme e un frutto diverso da tutti
   gli altri…

   Sai come riconoscere un albero da un altro?
   Per imparare il loro nome e cognome, puoi costruire la carta d’identità
   del tuo albero.

   Primo passo: la foglia
   Il primo elemento da osservare è la foglia: la forma, il contorno, le sue
   caratteristiche e come si attacca ai rami.
   Raccogline una, con il picciolo, e attaccala su un foglio.

   Secondo passo: l’ impronta della corteccia
   La corteccia è la “pelle” dell’albero.
   Come noi esseri umani abbiamo pelli diverse di colore, lisce, rugose,
   giovani, invecchiate..… gli alberi hanno cortecce molto diverse.
   Appoggia un foglio al tronco dell’albero che stai osservando, con un
   pastello a cera tenuto “sdraiato” strofina ora il foglio, cercando di non
   muoverlo.
   Apparirà l’impronta della corteccia, unica e diversa per ogni albero, a
   seconda della specie, dell’età, di ciò che gli è successo durante la sua
   vita…( con ferite, cicatrici…)

   Terzo passo: la sua sagoma
   Ora osserva l’albero nella sua interezza. La sua forma cosa ti ricorda?
   Fai un disegno.

   Quarto passo
   Vedo gemme, semi, fiori, frutti?
   Raccogli un esemplare di gemme, fiori o frutti se ne ha attaccati ai rami.
   Ogni tipo di albero produce gemme, fiori, semi e frutti diversi da tutti
   gli altri tipi!
   Attenzione se raccogli da per terra: a volte il vento e gli animali
   spostano e trasportano, quindi potrebbe anche non essere parte del tuo
   albero!
   Ora prova abbinare ai tuoi reperti e disegni questa scheda d’osservazione:

   A PRIMA VISTA…osservo, descrivo…

   Scarica la scheda

   La carta d’identità del tuo albero è pronta!
   Prova ora a cercare il suo nome su qualche manuale che parla di alberi.
   E’ facile, basta confrontare la foglia e le tue osservazioni con le
   immagini e le descrizioni che leggi.
   Attento però anche ai particolari, alcuni alberi si assomigliano (come per
   gli animali, per esempio le bisce e i serpenti, le rane e i rospi…).

   Osserva il tuo albero nel passare delle stagioni, cambierà aspetto
   moltissimo!

L'albero della Paulownia

    ​Cenni Storici

   1 - paulownia.jpg

   L’albero della paulownia (in latino paulowania), o paulonia, nel mondo
   anche conosciuto come Princess tree, Kiri tree, albero della vita, albero
   di Adamo, Empress tree, fox-glove tree, è una pianta decidua appartenente
   alla famiglia delle Paulowniaceae originaria della Cina e da secoli
   piantato altresì in Giappone (Kiri in giapponese significa “vita”), dove è
   considerato un albero sacro, portatore di felicità e prosperità, ad alto
   valore simbolico per la nazione (basti pensare che la paulownia è anche
   raffigurata su un moneta giapponese).

   2 - yen.jpg
   3 - Anna Pavlovna.jpg

   Agli inizi dell’800, il naturalista tedesco Philip Franz von Siebold, di
   ritorno da una visita in Giappone, fece ritorno in Europa portando con sé
   alcuni semi dell’albero Kiri, ed in omaggio di Anna Pavlovna Romanova,
   figlia di Paolo I Imperatore di Russia, la quale aveva finanziato la
   missione asiatica, decise di dare all’albero il nome di Paulownia, nome
   patronimico di Anna; in seguito anche i giapponesi iniziarono a chiamare
   il Kiri con il nome europeo di Paulownia.

    L'albero

   La paulownia, è un genere di pianta appartenente alla famiglia delle
   Paulowniaceae che comprende oltre 20 specie, tra le quali le più
   conosciute sono la tomentosa, la elongata, la fortunei, la kawakamii, la
   catalpifolia, la taiwaniana, la fargesii.

   Si tratta dell’albero con la crescita più rapida al mondo, con enormi
   foglie (fino a 80 cm di diametro), grandi fiori melliferi che possono
   presentarsi in diverse colorazioni, un’ampia corona, e che può superare
   abbondantemente 1 metro di diametro e raggiungere i 30 metri di altezza; 
   pur prediligendo terreni sciolti, profondi e ben drenanti, la paulownia si
   adatta a quasi tutti i tipi di terreni e climi, potendo resistere a
   temperature molto alte così come a climi rigidissimi. In Cina, paese dal
   quale come detto proviene la paulownia, l’albero viene coltivato su una
   superficie di oltre 2 milioni di ettari, sulla metà dei quali la
   coltivazione viene affiancata a quella di altre colture utilizzando gli
   spazi intrafila.

   Uno degli aspetti più interessanti della paulownia, è che in seguito ad
   ogni taglio, la pianta si rigenera, può essere tagliata diverse volte
   (dalle 4 alle 7-8) e sopravvivere anche fino a 100 anni; dopo ogni taglio,
   quindi, non sarà necessario ripiantare l’albero, che ricrescerà invece più
   vigoroso e più veloce usufruendo dell’apparato radicale sviluppatosi prima
   dei tagli precedenti.

   Il legno di paulownia è molto chiaro, leggero e resistente, al punto che
   viene anche denominato “legno alluminio”; grazie alle sue caratteristiche
   uniche e straordinarie qualità, come meglio si vedrà in altra sezione,
   viene utilizzato per molteplici lavorazioni; la corteccia è liscia, di
   color grigio chiaro, e le foglie, che al primo anno sono molto grandi e
   fibrose, tendono a diventare più piccole nel corso della vita dell’albero.

   ​

   L’albero ha una fioritura primaverile che può durare oltre 2 mesi, con
   grandi fiori a campana che possono presentarsi di colore blu-lilla o
   bianco, di gradevole profumo e melliferi; la grande chioma e la rigogliosa
   fioritura rendono la pianta ideale per progetti di verde cittadino e
   parchi.

    

   Il sistema radicale della paulownia è formato da una radice a forma di
   ombrello che solitamente penetra il terreno fino ad una profondità massima
   di 1-1,5 metri, ed una radice fittonante che invece può raggiungere
   profondità fino a 8-9 metri; in ragione di tale sistema radicale, la
   paulownia viene spesso utilizzata al fine di assestare aree a rischio
   erosione, frane o smottamenti.

   Altra caratteristica peculiare della paulownia, è che in pratica non è
   soggetta ad attacchi di termiti, insetti e parassiti vari, elemento che ne
   rende semplice la coltivazione e non comporta l’utilizzo di prodotti
   chimici.

   Per quanto riguarda il contributo che la pianta può fornire all’ambiente,
   è dato consolidato che la paulownia sia l’albero con il maggior
   assorbimento di anidride carbonica nel mondo.

   Per quelle che sono le caratteristiche più importanti, vale la pena qui di
   seguito spendere alcune parole, in particolar modo con riguardo a:

    

   ADATTABILITÀ A TERRENI E CLIMI

   Come detto, e come meglio verrà descritto nella apposita scheda, la
   paulownia si adatta a diversi tipi di terreni e diversi climi. Per quanto
   riguarda i terreni, la pianta, pur prediligendo quelli leggeri, profondi e
   drenanti, cresce in qualsiasi tipo di terreno; per quanto concerne le aree
   climatiche e le temperature, alcuni cloni di paulownia resistono a
   temperature fino a +45 e -30 gradi celsius, ed hanno altresì un’ottima
   resistenza alla siccità.

   E’ però di tutta evidenza, che in caso di piantagioni commerciali,
   dovranno preferirsi terreni e condizioni climatiche particolarmente
   favorevoli, al fine di ottimizzare il ritorno dell’investimento iniziale
   (si veda in tal senso il paragrafo “condizioni ottimali di crescita”).

   RAPIDA CRESCITA

   Come detto, la paulownia è l’albero con la crescita più rapida al mondo.
   In condizioni ideali, e con adeguata cura della piantagione, i migliori
   cloni di paulownia possono raggiungere e superare i 35 cm di diametro ed i
   15 metri di altezza in 4-5 anni. In ogni caso, ai fini di una piantagione
   commerciale, è sempre opportuno considerare un periodo di 6-7 anni prima
   di arrivare al primo taglio utile, in modo da raggiungere dimensioni di
   tronco avente adeguato valore commerciale su almeno l’80-90% delle piante.

   IL LEGNO DI PAULOWNIA

   Dall’albero di paulownia si ricava un bellissimo legno a grana dritta, di
   colore chiaro, molto leggero ma con un incomparabile rapporto
   peso/resistenza, che lo ha portato ad ottenere la definizione di legno
   alluminio.

   Il legno è dotato di straordinarie proprietà, che lo rendono unico; tra
   queste vale la pena ricordare le seguenti:

     * Leggerezza: alcuni cloni di paulownia pesano molto meno di 300 kg al
       metro cubo

     * grandissima stabilità dimensionale

     * ottime proprietà isolanti (fonoassorbenti e di isolamento termico,
       elettrico e igroscopico)

     * resistenza al fuoco; il legno di paulownia brucia ad oltre 400 gradi
       centigradi

     * idrorepellenza: il legno ha un bassissimo assorbimento di umidità, e
       di conseguenza anche esposto ai più diversi agenti atmosferici, non
       muta forma e dimensione, e non si decompone

     * resistenza ai parassiti: l’alto valore dei tannini contenuti nel suo
       legno, rende la paulownia quasi inattaccabile da termiti ed altri
       parassiti

     * assenza di nodi: il tronco della paulownia, se correttamente
       cresciuto, risulta perfettamente diritto e privo di nodi

     * resistenza alla torsione, alla compressione ed alla flessione: il
       legno di paulownia presenta un indice di resistenza alla compressione
       che supera i 280 kg per cm2
        

   Per tutte le caratteristiche di cui sopra, è evidente come il legno di
   paulownia possa essere utilizzato per le più diverse applicazioni, come si
   vedrà in seguito.

   LE FOGLIE

   Le foglie della paulownia, che al primo anno sono molto grandi e fibrose
   (possono raggiungere 80-90 cm di larghezza), tendono a diventare più
   piccole nel corso della vita dell’albero; sono ricche di proteine (fino ad
   oltre il 20%) e di microelementi, con buona digeribilità. Per questi
   motivi le foglie sono spesso utilizzate nell’alimentazione animale
   (bovini, ovini, caprini), ma vengono altresì sovente utilizzate per la
   produzione di biocombustibili.

   I FIORI

   I fuori della paulownia sono caratterizzati dalla loro grandezza e dalla
   forma a campana; la fioritura primaverile può durare oltre 2 mesi ed i
   fiori possono presentarsi di colore blu-lilla o bianco, di gradevole
   profumo. Dai fiori di paulownia si ricava un miele pregiato, ed una
   piantagione può produrre oltre 500 kg di miele per ettaro.

   ASPETTI AMBIENTALI

   L’ASSORBIMENTO DI CO2

   La paulownia aiuta a pulire l'aria inquinata da gas nocivi e particelle,
   che raggiungono concentrazioni elevate, soprattutto nelle grandi città
   industriali. La paulownia assorbe fino a 10 volte più CO2 di qualsiasi
   altra specie di albero al mondo, rilasciando grandi quantità di O2
   attraverso la fotosintesi. Ogni acro (meno di mezzo ettaro) di alberi può
   assorbire dall’aria 13 tonnellate di particelle e gas nocivi CO2 ogni
   anno, e rilasciare circa 13 libbre di ossigeno al giorno, contribuendo a
   purificare l’aria da agenti inquinanti. Tutto ciò è reso possibile dalle
   grandi foglie dell'albero Paulownia che, per questa ragione, può essere
   descritta come il "polmone verde" delle nostre città. Le aziende e le
   industrie che, per le loro attività, emettono sostanze inquinanti, possono
   ricevere (free allocation) i cosiddetti “carbon credit” (o “quote di
   emissione”), al fine di compensare le proprie emissioni di CO2; inoltre,
   le aziende possono acquistare tali quote sul mercato ETS, come fossero un
   qualsiasi asset finanziario.

    

   BONIFICA DI TERRENI

   La paulownia è un albero dotato di grande adattabilità, capace di crescere
   anche in terreni inquinati da metalli pesanti e sostanze tossiche.
   Assorbendo queste sostanze, contribuisce pertanto a bonificare terreni che
   sarebbero difficilmente utilizzabili per altre colture, purificandone il
   suolo e le acque al suo interno. Le grandi foglie, inoltre, una volta
   cadute fertilizzano il suolo ed arricchiscono il terreno di humus
   naturale.

    

   MESSA IN SICUREZZA DI AREE A RISCHIO

   Grazie al suo apparato radicale, la paulownia viene spesso utilizzata
   nella lotta contro l’erosione dei suoli, al fine di assestare aree a
   rischio frane e smottamenti.

       Che tipo di albero sei? E qual è la tua fotosintesi clorofilliana?

   micheledignazio Maggio 30, 2018 Lascia un commento

   Prendendo spunto da alcune parti di “Storia di una matita. A casa” chiedo
   ai bambini di raccontarmi che tipo di albero si sentono di essere, ma
   soprattutto qual è la loro fotosintesi clorofilliana, ovvero quell’azione
   utile per loro stessi, per la loro vita, ma anche e soprattutto per tutti
   quelli che li circondano.

   Gli alberi sono maestri capaci di trasmettere, con un linguaggio diverso
   da quello delle parole, saggezza, altruismo e, perché no, senso civico. La
   fotosintesi clorofilliana non è altro che questo: dalla luce del sole gli
   alberi traggono nutrimento e forza, quindi vivono e crescono ma, allo
   stesso tempo, rilasciano ossigeno. Fanno un bene a loro stessi, ma anche
   agli altri esseri viventi.

   “Maestro, vuoi dire che dobbiamo essere ossigeno per gli altri?”
   “Sì, esattamente!”

   “Non si starà mica trasformando in una quercia?” pensò Lapo, ricordandosi
   di quellaStoria di una matita. A casa (Copertina) volta in cui, dopo un
   forte raffreddore, lui si era trasformato in matita. Forse, la metamorfosi
   era un vizio di famiglia.
   Suo padre aveva fatto il contadino e il giardiniere per tutta la vita. In
   paese lo avevano soprannominato Cespuglio di more perché non si tagliava
   mai i capelli, che sembravano un folto groviglio di rovi.
   Leggenda voleva che, quando Cespuglio di more si addormentava sotto le
   querce, poteva capitare che qualche uccello scambiasse la sua chioma per
   un nido.
   Di notte, invece, toccava alle lucciole, che donavano alla sua
   capigliatura un tocco scintillante.
   Lapo non riusciva a togliersi quel pensiero dalla testa: e se il suo babbo
   si stava trasformando davvero in un albero? Con le braccia che diventavano
   rami, la pelle corteccia e i piedi radici? (da “Storia di una matita. A
   casa”, pagina 20)

   57. Albero Munari (2)

   Prima di inoltrarmi nel laboratorio, cerco di orientarmi insieme ai
   bambini, quindi ragioniamo su come sono fatti gli alberi.

Come sono fatti gli alberi?

   Partiamo dalla struttura.

    1. Radici
    2. Tronco e rami
    3. Chioma (foglie, fiori, frutti)

   Continuo con le caratteristiche degli alberi

     *  Vivono tantissimi anni, più degli esseri umani.
     * Non si possono spostare. Si muovono solo in altezza (crescendo verso
       l’alto) o in profondità (con le radici)

   Slide Albero - Radici 1

   “Perché gli alberi, a differenza delle persone, non possono muoversi: ci
   hai mai pensato? Se tu hai caldo ti sposti all’ombra, se arriva una
   tempesta cerchi riparo, se la terra su cui poggi è instabile cerchi un
   posto più sicuro. Gli alberi no, sono piantati lì dove sono nati. E’ per
   questo che sono più resistenti, più duttili, più intelligenti – mi viene
   da dire – degli uomini. Devono fare con quello che c’è, adattarsi
   all’esigenza. Pensa se ci riuscissimo anche noi, sempre. Loro ci vedono
   passare, ci guardano, sanno”.

     * A loro modo, gli alberi parlano. Ci parlano con il loro aspetto. Se
       non crescono, significa che c’è qualcosa che non va. Se non fanno
       frutti, pure. Un albero pieno di frutti è un albero sano. Anche con la
       loro forma ci parlano. Se sono rigogliosi sono in forma, se sono
       spelacchiati, sono fuori forma. Hanno bisogno di affetto, attenzione,
       a volte anche aiuto.
     * Anche la forma del tronco è indicativa. Ci sono degli alberi che, a
       metà del loro tronco, sono un po’ storti, piegati. Significa che hanno
       avuto qualche difficoltà, si stavano accasciando, ma poi si sono
       rialzati.
     *  Gli alberi sono rispettosi, pieni di poesia, timidi.

   “La timidezza delle chiome. Sai cos’è? Hai mai visto nei boschi quella
   lama di luce che passa tra una chioma e un’altra, quando alzi la testa? La
   chioma dell’albero cresce, ma sa – sente – dove cresce l’altra e non si
   azzarda a toccarla. È timida. Quando l’altra chioma è vicina smette di
   crescere nella sua direzione. Non la invade, non la tocca”.

     * Simpatie tra gli alberi e le piante (e anche antipatie)

   E’ vero che tra le piante nascono simpatie e antipatie, come tra gli
   esseri umani. Le sostanze chimiche prodotte dalle piante possono avere
   azione stimolante o inibente su altre piante che crescono vicine. Dalla
   monocoltura (cioè dalla coltivazione di una sola specie su ogni
   appezzamento di terreno), si sta passando in alcune zone a colture
   differenziate di più specie che si migliorano a vicenda. L’agricoltura
   potrebbe uscirne rivoluzionata. E la storia del pomodoro e della salvia la
   sai? Il pomodoro cresce meglio se accanto ha una pianta di salvia. Non so
   perché, ha le sue ragioni. Diciamo che al pomodoro piace avere la salvia
   vicina. Ma la cosa incredibile sai qual è? Che se tu metti una pianta di
   pomodoro e una di salvia sotto due campane di vetro, vicine, in un
   laboratorio – è un esperimento che hanno fatto – il pomodoro cresce lo
   stesso più rigoglioso, felice. Come fa a sapere che c’è la salvia? Non ha
   occhi, non vede. Allora come fa. E’ come quando tu senti che qualcuno ti
   pensa, credo.

Tanti tipi di alberi

   Inizio a descrivere alcuni alberi, partendo da caratteristiche vere, per
   scivolare gradualmente in descrizioni un po’ fantasiose, prendendo qualche
   libertà narrativa.

   Matita a Romena

   Il Mandorlo, ad esempio, è il primo a fare i fiori, l’ultimo a fare i
   frutti.

   La Quercia è uno degli alberi più longevi e saggi. Non è raro trovare
   esemplari dall’età di 500 anni. I suoi rami sono così robusti che
   diventano delle vere e proprie panchine sospese nel cielo, per chi è così
   temerario da arrampicarsi fino in cima.

   Il Corbezzolo è un albero speciale. È sempreverde, quindi non perde mai le
   foglie, ma la sua caratteristica principale è che fa i frutti e i fiori,
   contemporaneamente. Foglie, frutti e fiori allo stesso tempo. Nessun
   albero ne è capace.

   Il Platano è l’albero giraffa, perché ha delle macchie tonde su tutto il 
   tronco, così come le giraffe le hanno sul loro corpo. E poi è altissimo.
   Le sue punte riescono a vedere l’intera città e fanno invidia ai palazzi
   di sei piani.

   Il Gelso è l’albero con le spalle alzate. Sembra dire “Che ci posso fare,
   se sono così bello, sinuoso e se, a maggio, faccio dei frutti così buoni?
   Però attenti che se vi macchiate con i miei gelsi neanche il migliore dei
   detersivi farà venire via il mio rosso intenso!”

   L’ibiscus è l’albero più timido che c’è. Ed io, a guardarlo, mi inibiscus.

   L’albicocco vuole essere coccolato, è il cocco di mamma. Si crea sempre un
   alibi per farsi coccolare: le sue foglie verdi e grandi, a forma di mani,
   pronte a raccogliere l’acqua o a dare una carezza, e i suoi rami con
   appesi tanti frutti succosi. Non c’è niente da fare, è così abile che a
   volte, per sbaglio, viene chiamato abilecocco.

Arriviamo al Binomio Fantastico.

   Ed eccolo lì! Di fronte a lui c’era l’albero della bicicletta.
   “Uno di famiglia…” diceva Cespuglio di more.
   Lapo era molto affezionato a quel groviglio di rami e pedali. Lo osservò
   da vicino: dal tronco sbucavano il manubrio di una bicicletta, un
   cerchione e un sellino. Quella strana simbiosi era nata, tantissimi anni
   prima, da una banale distrazione del suo bisnonno, che aveva scordato la
   bici appoggiata a un castagno. Poi era partito per un lungo viaggio e al
   suo ritorno aveva ritrovato la bicicletta avvolta in un abbraccio dai rami
   e dalle foglie della pianta: faceva ormai parte dell’albero.L'albero della
   bicicletta
   Era un vero e proprio simbolo per il paese, l’albero della bicicletta:
   l’unione tra l’uomo e la natura.
   L’albero da cui, anziché fiori e petali, facevano capolino raggi e pedali.
   Con il tronco che ha le marce, ma non marcisce.

   (da “Storia di una matita. A casa”, pagina 82)

   L’albero della bicicletta, l’albero di matite, l’albero della matematica,
   dei quadri, dell’alimentazione, dei ricordi, degli aquiloni, della gioia,
   delle stagioni, del telescopio, dei bikini, delle valigie, dei libri,
   delle cravatte, dei martelli, delle stelle, delle emozioni, degli occhiali
   da sole, dei pantaloni, delle lettere e così via… (I disegni sono dei
   ragazzi della scuola primaria di Fossacesia, in provincia di Chieti)

   Per arrivare infine a quello che probabilmente è l’aspetto più importante:

Qual è la tua fotosintesi?

   La fotosintesi è quel processo che trasforma la luce (foto) del sole in
   energia. Inizia con le foglie, che assorbono la luce, coinvolgendo poi
   tutta la pianta, che così cresce, vive, sempre con più energia.
   Allora, qual è la tua fotosintesi? Cos’è che ti dà più energia?

   Ma l’aspetto più interessante è che, nel processo di fotosintesi, la
   pianta si nutre, prende l’energia che gli serve e, allo stesso tempo,
   trasforma l’anidride carbonica presente nell’aria in ossigeno, che ci fa
   bene, che ci fa respirare, rende l’aria più salubre e pulita.

   Quindi, in un colpo solo, fa il bene suo e di tutti gli esseri viventi che
   la circondano. Non è incredibile?

   [IMG]Distribuzione bialbero a 4 valvole per cilindro per motore
   quadricilindrico in linea [IMG]Albero a camme per motore o bancata
   quadricilidrici

   L'albero a camme, nella meccanica, è un albero motore con parti
   eccentriche calettate, atto a trasmettere particolari leggi di moto agli
   elementi che vi sono a contatto. Nei motori a scoppio è l'albero
   responsabile della distribuzione su cui sono montati degli eccentrici,
   detti "camme", forzate su un tubo in acciaio cementato (generalmente
   acciaio 18NiCrMo5) o costituenti un tutt'uno forgiato o realizzati tramite
   idroformatura, che comandano l'apertura e la chiusura delle valvole.
   L'albero a camme si trova solo nel motore a 4 tempi sia benzina
   (accensione comandata) che diesel (accensione spontanea) ed in alcuni
   motori a due tempi unidirezionali.

Albero a camme[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]Animazione rappresentante il funzionamento delle camme

   L'albero a camme viene azionato dall'albero motore rispetto al quale ruota
   (nel motore a quattro tempi) a velocità angolare dimezzata e al quale è
   generalmente collegato tramite catena o cinghia. In alcuni motori il
   collegamento viene effettuato tramite meccanismi costituiti da una cascata
   di ingranaggi, alberelli con coppie coniche o coppia di bielle.

   Il profilo delle camme è caratterizzato da un'eccentricità più o meno
   marcata (alzo). La forma degli eccentrici è determinante ai fini delle
   prestazioni in quanto regola il diagramma di apertura, fasature e
   ampiezze, e anche ai fini della rumorosità in quanto regola l'impatto tra
   valvole e sedi delle stesse.

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Camma.

   Nei motori attuali l'albero a camme è situato generalmente al di sopra
   della testata. Con tale disposizione prende il nome di "albero a camme in
   testa" e comanda le valvole mediante punterie a bicchiere. In altri motori
   l'albero a camme era situato lateralmente alla testata del motore.

   A seconda del numero di valvole per cilindro e della disposizione dei
   cilindri ci possono essere più alberi a camme, anche se generalmente non
   superano i due per bancata (doppio albero a camme in testa). Altri sistemi
   prevedono prima delle valvole vari rimandi meccanici quali aste o
   bilancieri, sistemi comunque progressivamente abbandonati per il maggior
   numero di parti in movimento.

L'importanza dell'albero a camme[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Gli alberi a camme, dato che decidono quando e quanto devono aprirsi le
   valvole, sono di grande importanza per le prestazioni dei motori. Il
   variatore della fase di distribuzione, infatti, posto di norma su entrambi
   i lati, permette di variare il tempo di apertura della valvola.
   Aumentandolo, si ha un maggiore riempimento della camera di combustione
   con conseguente aumento di potenza e coppia motrice.

   La variazione della fase di scarico, invece, permette di aumentare
   l'incrocio valvole, ovvero la fase in cui sono aperte contemporaneamente
   (dopo lo scoppio della miscela) sia le valvole di aspirazione sia quelle
   di scarico, in modo che i gas incombusti vengano espulsi dalla camera
   grazie all'entrata della nuova miscela. In questa fase si perde una
   piccola percentuale di miscela, ma il vantaggio che se ne ricava è un
   forte lavaggio della camera di combustione, che così ad ogni scoppio è
   sempre "pulita" e raffreddata a dovere.

   Se a questo associamo anche il variatore d'alzata, che modifica
   l'escursione in millimetri della valvola, otteniamo un motore in grado di
   erogare più di 100 cv/l.

   Queste ultime considerazioni ci fanno capire quanto sia importante l'asse
   a camme, un elemento tante volte trascurato tuttavia uno dei primi su cui
   si va ad agire quando si vuole aumentare la potenza di un motore in modo
   meccanico e non elettronico.

Messa in fase dell'albero a camme[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero a camme può essere messo in fase tramite sistemi diversi:

     * fori asolati i fori presenti sull'ingranaggio da accoppiare
       sull'albero sono asolati, in modo da poter variare facilmente e
       velocemente la fasatura;
     * chiavetta di Woodruff sfalsata, l'ingranaggio viene accoppiato tramite
       questa chiavetta, oppure ogni lobo è provvisto di una chiavetta
       propria;
     * nonio o verniero, prevede l'unione dell'albero all'ingranaggio tramite
       dei fori presenti su entrambi, ma che hanno numero diversi tra loro
       (20 a 19, ecc...)

   Abete albero - abies - tipi di abete - Trentino Garden

                                Albero di Natale

Abete (Abies), un albero incantevole simbolo della lunga vita

   L’abete è un albero appartenente alla famiglia delle Pinaceace Abies,
   diffuso ampiamente nel territorio delle Alpi e soprattutto in Trentino
   Alto Adige, anche nell’Appennino e nell’Europa del Nord. Esistono
   quarantotto differenti tipi di abete: Trentino Garden ne ha selezionate
   cinque specie per la vendita online.
   Abete del Caucaso, Abete del Colorado, Abete delle rocce dell’Arizona,
   Abete di Serbia e l’Abete da vaso sono disponibili online. Scegli l’albero
   che stai cercando per il tuo giardino, oppure per festeggiare il Natale e
   acquistalo: lo faremo arrivare velocemente e in piena salute a casa tua.
   Resteremo a tua disposizione anche nel post vendita, per domande e per
   garantirti consigli utili e indicazioni sulla coltivazione e crescita del
   tuo abete. Un albero sempreverde, un abete vero, è il miglior modo per
   portare ombra, aria pura e benessere nel tuo parco o sul tuo terrazzo.

  Caratteristiche dell’abete

   L’abete è un albero che può raggiungere i 100 metri di altezza (in Italia
   è mediamente alto intorno ai 40), con tronco dritto, chioma solitamente
   piramidale e corteccia sottile. Le foglie sono aghiformi, cioè costituite
   da aghi appuntiti di colore verde cupo. Gli aghi sono lunghi tra i due e i
   tre centimetri, si presentano disposti in due file, con la cima
   arrotondata. Un abete ha circa 250 aghi ogni 10 cm di ramo e per ogni
   metro di altezza sviluppa tra i due e i dieci metri di rami.
   L’abete produce strobili (frutti) detti anche “pigne” di dimensioni e
   forme varie.

   L’abete è un albero che simboleggia la vita eterna e che fin
   dall’antichità viene celebrato per la sua maestosità. Secondo alcuni,
   infatti, la parola latina “abies” potrebbe derivare dal greco “longevo”
   (può vivere fino a 600 anni), mentre secondo altri da “abire”, che
   significa “andarsene dal terreno”, metafora per descrivere l’altezza che
   contraddistingue questo albero.

   La crescita dell’abete è lenta e per questo la sua coltivazione è famosa
   per essere rivolta solo ad agricoltori ed hobbisti pazienti.
   Se in vaso, l’abete predilige luoghi poco assolati e in estate richiede
   abbondanti annaffiature, mentre se posizionato in terra è importante
   semplicemente scegliere posizioni non siccitose e prive di ristagni di
   acqua.
   Se avete appena comprato un abete per tenerlo in casa, assicuratevi di
   aver predisposto dei buchi drenanti nel vaso, dove sarebbe perfetto
   mischiare un buon terriccio universale con torba acida. Evitate la
   vicinanza con stufe o camini.

  Scopri l'albero "Frankenstein", capace di produrre fino a 40 tipi diversi di
                      frutti: dove si trova e quali sono?

   Ti presentiamo Frankenstein, un progetto affascinante che è riuscito a
   produrre dozzine di diversi tipi di frutti da un unico albero. Vuoi sapere
   come è stato ottenuto questo risultato? Leggi i dettagli qui sotto.

   albero frankensteinL'L'albero dei 40 frutti di Sam Van Aken è un albero
   unico che produce quaranta diversi tipi di drupacee, tra cui pesche,
   susine, albicocche, nettarine, ciliegie e mandorle. Pamela Henríquez

   L'albero di Frankenstein, detto anche l'albero dei quaranta frutti, è una
   creazione naturale che nasce come manifestazione artistica a favore della
   conservazione dell'ambiente e come impegno scientifico. Nonostante sia
   popolarmente conosciuto come l'albero di Frankenstein, il suo aspetto è
   molto più bello di quello del terrificante mostro nato dalla mente di Mary
   Shelley. La verità è che questa specie non ha un nome proprio, si chiama
   semplicemente "l'albero dai 40 frutti".

Come e perché è nata questa idea?

   Questa idea è stata concepita nel 2008 da Sam Van Aken, professore di arte
   alla Syracuse University, nello stato di New York. L'obiettivo dello
   scultore era quello di creare un'opera che trascendesse l'arte,
   l'agricoltura e la conservazione.

   Lo definisce una capsula vivente di biodiversità, nata per conservare e
   sensibilizzare sulla perdita di diversità dei frutti che consumiamo.

   La scelta del numero 40 non è casuale. Secondo Van Aken è stato scelto
   perché nelle religioni occidentali è usato come numero non quantificabile,
   sinonimo di moltitudine, quindi è legato a uno dei motivi per cui lui,
   insegnante d'arte nato nella fattoria di famiglia, ha avviato questo
   progetto: sensibilizzare sulla perdita di diversità alimentare.

   “Cento anni fa, negli Stati Uniti si coltivavano 2.000 varietà di pesche,
   quasi 2.000 varietà di prugne e quasi 800 varietà di mele. Oggi ne rimane
   solo una frazione e sono minacciate dall’industrializzazione
   dell’agricoltura, dalle malattie e dai cambiamenti climatici”, ha
   affermato Van Aken.

   albero dei 40 fruttiIn realtà la macedonia è piuttosto limitata nel numero
   di frutti ma ricca di varietà di pesche, susine, ciliegie, nettarine e
   albicocche.

Ma come funziona la magia di Frankenstein?

   Questo numero di alberi, ridotti a una specie, sono stati creati sulla
   base degli innesti, una tecnica conosciuta fin dall'antichità che consiste
   nel far crescere un frammento di una pianta sul tronco di un'altra,
   facendo sì che i tessuti di entrambe si uniscano nel punto di unione e, di
   conseguenza, l'innesto può svilupparsi assorbendo indirettamente i
   nutrienti.

   Il risultato è un albero che può produrre fiori e frutti di tante varietà
   quanti sono gli innesti possibili e che svolge anche altre funzioni. Da un
   lato, perpetuare ed estendere le varietà di frutti più appetibili,
   produttivi o resistenti e, dall'altro, che svolgono una funzione
   adattativa: poiché è il tronco a essere in contatto con il suolo.

   Ci sono voluti diversi anni per produrre ognuno di questi alberi: gli
   innesti si effettuano in primavera, ma bisogna aspettare un anno intero
   per verificare se il processo è andato a buon fine, due o tre perché
   inizino a dare frutti e fino a otto per completare un albero che produce
   40 frutti diversi.

Che tipo di alberi produce Frankenstein?

   Gli alberi coltivati dal professor Van Aken appartengono al genere Prunus,
   che comprende, tra le altre specie, peschi, susini, ciliegi e albicocchi;
   ognuno di essi con centinaia o migliaia di varietà. Per gran parte
   dell'anno assomigliano a qualsiasi altro albero, ma quando arriva la
   primavera fioriscono in varie tonalità di bianco e rosa. Lo spettacolo più
   grande arriva in estate, quando i fiori lasciano il posto a 40 varietà
   diverse di pesche, susine, ciliegie, nettarine e albicocche.

    Gli anelli degli alberi rivelano il vero riscaldamento del periodo caldo
                                   medievale

   Per decenni, il “periodo caldo medievale” è stato considerato un capitolo
   di riscaldamento eccezionale nella storia della Terra. Tuttavia, gli
   anelli degli alberi mettono in discussione questa convinzione di lunga
   data.

   anelli alberi climaIl “periodo caldo medievale” era considerato un

   Per molto tempo, l’“anomalia climatica medievale” è rimasta un enigma per
   gli scienziati che studiavano il clima del passato. Si riteneva che
   durante questo periodo, che comprendeva il Medioevo e i secoli successivi,
   le temperature prevalenti fossero state insolitamente calde, addirittura
   più elevate di quelle che sperimentiamo nell’era contemporanea.

   La prova di questo andamento meteorologico è stata trovata in bella vista
   negli anelli degli alberi. Tuttavia, le cause di questo riscaldamento non
   sono state completamente chiarite e i ricercatori non sono riusciti a
   trovare una spiegazione fisica che possa spiegare un livello così
   eccezionale di calore nei modelli climatici. Le simulazioni, di
   conseguenza, mostravano solo temperature moderatamente calde per quel
   periodo.

   Tuttavia, una nuova scoperta è appena emersa e promette di cambiare ciò
   che fino ad ora pensavamo di sapere. La ricerca, che utilizza nuove
   tecniche per analizzare gli anelli degli alberi, suggerisce che forse quel
   periodo non era così caldo come si pensava in precedenza.

Testimoni della variabilità climatica

   Gli alberi possono immagazzinare informazioni sui cambiamenti climatici
   nel tempo e lo studio degli anelli è stato utilizzato per decenni per
   estrarre queste informazioni e utilizzarle per migliorare la nostra
   comprensione dei cambiamenti climatici passati e attuali. Ma ora un team
   di scienziati dell’Istituto federale di ricerca per la foresta, la neve e
   il paesaggio WSL ha sviluppato una nuova tecnica di precisione.
   Utilizzando un laser, è possibile misurare lo spessore delle cellule di
   legno dell'albero, consentendo agli scienziati di calcolare le
   informazioni sull'albero con una precisione fino a un anno.

     Así se sabe la edad de un árbol

     Este método es conocido como dendrocronología, implica contar los
     anillos concéntricos que se encuentran dentro del tronco del árbol. Cada
     anillo generalmente representa un año de crecimiento.

   "Le ricostruzioni precedenti si basavano sulla larghezza o sulla densità
   degli anelli annuali degli alberi", spiega Georg von Arx dell'Istituto
   federale di ricerca per la foresta, la neve e il paesaggio WSL. "Entrambi
   dipendono fortemente dalla temperatura, ma a volte altri fattori giocano
   un ruolo nella larghezza o nella densità dell'anello di un albero."

   Gli alberi possono immagazzinare informazioni su eventi storici, come
   incendi, siccità e parassiti, e la dendrocronologia di precisione può
   essere utilizzata per estrarre queste informazioni e utilizzarle per
   comprendere meglio la storia naturale del pianeta.

   È così che gli scienziati si sono lanciati nel compito di misurare
   direttamente lo spessore delle pareti cellulari negli anelli degli alberi.
   Questo approccio ha consentito un’analisi più acuta e approfondita. I
   risultati fanno luce sull'"anomalia climatica medievale", rivelando che
   non si è trattato di un periodo di caldo eccezionale come si ipotizzava in
   precedenza, almeno nella regione della Scandinavia oggetto dello studio.
   Le temperature erano più fresche di quanto si immaginasse in precedenza.

   Questa scoperta supporta le basi degli attuali modelli climatici e indica
   un fatto innegabile: l’attuale riscaldamento del pianeta è davvero unico
   negli ultimi 1.200 anni.

Il periodo caldo medievale

   Il periodo caldo medievale si riferisce a un periodo di riscaldamento
   avvenuto tra gli anni 900 e 1250 d.C. Durante questo periodo si presume
   che le temperature globali siano aumentate di 1-2°C al di sopra delle
   condizioni attuali, con un impatto considerevole sia sul clima della Terra
   che sull’umanità.

   In questo periodo, i Vichinghi beneficiarono della diminuzione delle
   calotte glaciali nei mari, che permise loro di colonizzare regioni come la
   Groenlandia e altre terre circostanti nel Canada settentrionale,
   espandendo così i loro domini.

   Parallelamente, in gran parte dell’Europa sono stati osservati
   miglioramenti nella produzione agricola, con l’adozione di nuove colture e
   attività. Un esempio noto è la coltivazione della vite, che ha portato al
   fiorire della produzione vinicola.

   Il periodo caldo medievale terminò nel XIII secolo e fu seguito da un
   periodo di raffreddamento noto come Piccola Era Glaciale.

   Anche se per molto tempo si è pensato che il periodo medievale fosse un
   momento di cambiamento climatico globale, ricerche più recenti hanno
   prodotto risultati diversi. Attualmente non è stata trovata alcuna prova
   conclusiva che questo riscaldamento abbia avuto una portata globale,
   essendo per lo più limitato alla regione europea.

   supera ogni limite! Cosa sta succedendo?

   In realtà, l’evidenza suggerisce che, su scala globale, la situazione
   potrebbe esser stata esattamente opposta. I dati raccolti da varie fonti,
   come carote di ghiaccio, anelli degli alberi e depositi lacustri, indicano
   infatti che a livello globale la temperatura della Terra durante il
   periodo caldo medievale era anche leggermente più fresca, con una
   differenza di circa 0,03 °C rispetto ai record di temperatura registrati a
   inizio e metà del XX secolo.

   Questi risultati mettono in discussione l’idea precedentemente sostenuta
   di un riscaldamento diffuso durante quel periodo ed evidenziano la
   complessità degli andamenti climatici storici nelle diverse parti del
   mondo.

Introduzione

   L’Albero dei fiori bianchi è una pianta affascinante e attraente,
   ampiamente apprezzata per la sua straordinaria fioritura bianca che dona
   un aspetto elegante e sofisticato a qualsiasi giardino. Questa guida
   completa ti fornirà tutte le informazioni necessarie sulla cura, la
   coltivazione e le caratteristiche di questa pianta, aiutandoti a
   comprendere meglio come far prosperare il tuo Albero dei fiori bianchi.

             Identificazione e Cura degli Alberi con Fiori Bianchi

   Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono un’aggiunta affascinante a qualsiasi
   paesaggio, offrendo un tocco di eleganza e grazia. Questi alberi, con la
   loro fioritura spettacolare, possono trasformare un giardino ordinario in
   un paradiso incantevole. Tuttavia, per mantenere la loro bellezza, è
   essenziale conoscere le tecniche di identificazione e cura.

   Iniziamo con l’identificazione. Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono
   disponibili in una varietà di specie, ognuna con le sue caratteristiche
   uniche. Ad esempio, il melo selvatico (Malus sylvestris) è noto per i suoi
   fiori bianchi profumati che sbocciano in primavera. Allo stesso modo, il
   ciliegio giapponese (Prunus serrulata) produce fiori bianchi o rosa
   pallido, mentre il magnolio stellato (Magnolia stellata) sfoggia fiori
   bianchi a forma di stella.

   Oltre ai fiori, le foglie e la corteccia possono aiutare
   nell’identificazione. Ad esempio, il ciliegio da fiore ha foglie ovali con
   bordi seghettati, mentre il magnolio stellato ha foglie oblunghe di colore
   verde scuro. La corteccia, d’altra parte, può variare da grigio chiaro a
   marrone scuro, a seconda della specie.

   Una volta identificato l’albero, passiamo alla cura. La maggior parte
   degli alberi con fiori bianchi preferisce un terreno ben drenato e una
   posizione soleggiata o parzialmente ombreggiata. Tuttavia, alcune specie,
   come il magnolio stellato, possono tollerare l’ombra. È importante
   ricordare che un terreno povero di nutrienti può influire sulla fioritura,
   quindi è consigliabile arricchire il terreno con compost o fertilizzante
   organico prima di piantare.

   L’irrigazione è un altro aspetto cruciale della cura. Mentre gli alberi
   giovani richiedono un’irrigazione regolare, gli alberi maturi possono
   tollerare periodi di siccità. Tuttavia, durante i periodi di siccità
   prolungata, un’irrigazione supplementare può essere necessaria per
   prevenire lo stress idrico.

   La potatura è un altro aspetto importante della cura degli alberi con
   fiori bianchi. Questo non solo mantiene l’albero in forma, ma favorisce
   anche una fioritura più abbondante. La potatura dovrebbe essere effettuata
   in tarda primavera o in estate, dopo la fioritura. È importante rimuovere
   solo i rami morti, danneggiati o malati, evitando di tagliare i rami che
   producono fiori.

   Infine, la prevenzione delle malattie e dei parassiti è fondamentale per
   mantenere l’albero sano. Molti alberi con fiori bianchi sono suscettibili
   a malattie come la ruggine e l’oidio, che possono essere prevenute con
   l’uso di fungicidi. Allo stesso modo, i parassiti come gli afidi e le
   cocciniglie possono essere controllati con l’uso di insetticidi o metodi
   di controllo biologico.

   In conclusione, gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono un’aggiunta meravigliosa
   a qualsiasi giardino, ma richiedono una cura adeguata per prosperare. Con
   una corretta identificazione e cura, questi alberi possono fornire anni di
   bellezza e godimento.

    Le Varie Specie di Alberi con Fiori Bianchi: Un’Esplorazione Dettagliata

   Albero fiori bianchi: Tutto quello che devi sapere
   Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono un elemento di spicco in molti paesaggi,
   grazie alla loro bellezza eterea e alla loro capacità di attirare
   l’attenzione. Questi alberi, con le loro fioriture bianche, possono
   variare notevolmente in termini di dimensioni, forma e requisiti di
   crescita, offrendo una vasta gamma di opzioni per i giardinieri di tutti i
   livelli di esperienza.

   Iniziamo con il magnolio stellato, una specie popolare per la sua
   fioritura precoce. Questo albero, originario del Giappone, è noto per i
   suoi fiori bianchi a forma di stella che sbocciano in primavera, prima che
   appaiano le foglie. I fiori hanno un profumo dolce e leggero, che aggiunge
   un ulteriore livello di fascino a questo albero.

   Un altro albero con fiori bianchi degno di nota è il ciliegio giapponese,
   o Prunus serrulata. Questo albero è famoso per la sua spettacolare
   fioritura primaverile, durante la quale si copre di fiori bianchi o rosa
   pallido. Questi fiori, noti come sakura in Giappone, sono un simbolo di
   primavera e di rinascita, e la loro fioritura è celebrata ogni anno con
   feste e picnic sotto gli alberi in fiore.

   Passando a una specie più resistente, l’abete bianco, o Abies concolor, è
   un albero sempreverde che produce piccoli fiori bianchi in primavera.
   Questo albero è apprezzato per la sua resistenza al freddo e la sua
   capacità di crescere in una varietà di terreni, rendendolo una scelta
   popolare per i paesaggi nelle regioni più fredde.

   Per coloro che cercano un albero con fiori bianchi che sia anche
   profumato, il gelsomino è una scelta eccellente. Questo albero, che può
   crescere come un arbusto o come una vite, produce fiori bianchi
   intensamente profumati che possono riempire un intero giardino con il loro
   aroma. Il gelsomino è anche resistente e facile da coltivare, rendendolo
   una scelta popolare per i giardinieri.

   Infine, per coloro che cercano un albero con fiori bianchi che offra anche
   un frutto commestibile, il melo è una scelta eccellente. Questo albero
   produce fiori bianchi in primavera, seguiti da mele in autunno. Le varietà
   di melo variano notevolmente in termini di dimensioni e sapore delle mele,
   offrendo molte opzioni per i giardinieri.

   In conclusione, gli alberi con fiori bianchi offrono una vasta gamma di
   opzioni per i giardinieri, con specie che variano in termini di
   dimensioni, forma, requisiti di crescita e caratteristiche aggiuntive come
   il profumo o la produzione di frutta. Che tu stia cercando un albero da
   fiore per un piccolo giardino o un albero da frutto per un grande
   frutteto, c’è un albero con fiori bianchi che si adatta alle tue esigenze.

      Come Coltivare e Mantenere Alberi con Fiori Bianchi nel Tuo Giardino

   Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono una scelta popolare per molti
   giardinieri grazie alla loro bellezza senza tempo e alla loro capacità di
   aggiungere un tocco di eleganza a qualsiasi paesaggio. Questi alberi, con
   le loro fioriture bianche luminose, possono trasformare un giardino
   ordinario in un paradiso incantato. Tuttavia, la coltivazione e la
   manutenzione di questi alberi richiedono una certa attenzione e cura.

   Innanzitutto, è importante scegliere il tipo giusto di albero con fiori
   bianchi per il tuo giardino. Ci sono molte varietà tra cui scegliere, tra
   cui il ciliegio, il magnolio stellato, il melo ornamentale e il pero da
   fiore. Ognuno di questi alberi ha requisiti di crescita leggermente
   diversi, quindi è importante fare una ricerca approfondita prima di fare
   una scelta.

   Una volta scelto l’albero, il passo successivo è piantarlo nel posto
   giusto. La maggior parte degli alberi con fiori bianchi preferisce un
   luogo soleggiato o parzialmente ombreggiato. È anche importante garantire
   che l’albero abbia abbastanza spazio per crescere. Molti alberi con fiori
   bianchi possono diventare piuttosto grandi, quindi è necessario prevedere
   un ampio spazio per la loro crescita.

   Il terreno è un altro fattore cruciale da considerare. Gli alberi con
   fiori bianchi prosperano in terreni ben drenati. Se il terreno nel tuo
   giardino è pesante o argilloso, potrebbe essere necessario modificarlo con
   compost o altro materiale organico per migliorare il drenaggio. Inoltre,
   questi alberi preferiscono un pH del suolo da neutro a leggermente acido.

   Una volta piantato l’albero, è importante fornire un’adeguata cura e
   manutenzione. Questo include l’irrigazione regolare, soprattutto durante i
   periodi di siccità. Tuttavia, è importante non innaffiare eccessivamente,
   poiché questo può portare a problemi di radici marce. La potatura è un
   altro aspetto importante della manutenzione. La maggior parte degli alberi
   con fiori bianchi beneficia di una potatura leggera per mantenere la forma
   e rimuovere eventuali rami morti o malati.

   La protezione contro le malattie e i parassiti è un altro aspetto
   importante della cura degli alberi con fiori bianchi. Molti di questi
   alberi sono suscettibili a vari problemi, tra cui la muffa, l’oidio e vari
   tipi di insetti. È importante monitorare regolarmente l’albero per segni
   di problemi e intervenire rapidamente se necessario.

   Infine, è importante ricordare che la pazienza è la chiave quando si
   tratta di coltivare alberi con fiori bianchi. Questi alberi possono
   richiedere diversi anni per stabilirsi e iniziare a fiorire profusamente.
   Tuttavia, con la giusta cura e attenzione, saranno in grado di fornire
   anni di bellezza e godimento.

   In conclusione, gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono una meravigliosa
   aggiunta a qualsiasi giardino. Con la giusta scelta, piantumazione, cura e
   manutenzione, questi alberi possono prosperare e fornire fioriture
   spettacolari per molti anni a venire.

         La Simbologia e il Significato degli Alberi con Fiori Bianchi

   Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono un elemento affascinante e significativo
   nel mondo della botanica e della simbologia. Questi alberi, con la loro
   bellezza eterea e la loro presenza imponente, hanno da sempre catturato
   l’immaginazione dell’uomo, diventando simboli di purezza, innocenza e
   rinascita.

   In molte culture, gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono considerati sacri. Ad
   esempio, in Giappone, il ciliegio con fiori bianchi, o “sakura”, è un
   simbolo di bellezza effimera e della transitorietà della vita. Questo
   concetto, noto come “mono no aware”, esprime la consapevolezza della
   fugacità delle cose belle e la tristezza che ne deriva. Durante la
   stagione della fioritura dei ciliegi, i giapponesi si radunano nei parchi
   per ammirare i delicati fiori bianchi, in un’usanza chiamata “hanami”.

   Anche in altre culture, gli alberi con fiori bianchi hanno un significato
   simbolico. Nel cristianesimo, ad esempio, l’azalea bianca è un simbolo di
   purezza, castità e innocenza. Questo fiore è spesso utilizzato nelle
   cerimonie religiose, come i battesimi, per rappresentare la purezza
   spirituale.

   Oltre alla simbologia religiosa, gli alberi con fiori bianchi hanno anche
   un significato in ambito psicologico. Il bianco è un colore che
   rappresenta la luce, la bontà, l’innocenza e la perfezione. Questo colore
   ha un effetto calmante e può aiutare a ridurre lo stress e l’ansia.
   Pertanto, avere un albero con fiori bianchi nel proprio giardino o in casa
   può contribuire a creare un ambiente sereno e pacifico.

   Gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono anche molto apprezzati per le loro
   proprietà estetiche. I loro fiori, con i loro petali delicati e le loro
   forme eleganti, sono un vero spettacolo per gli occhi. Inoltre, molti di
   questi alberi producono un profumo dolce e avvolgente, che può arricchire
   l’atmosfera di un giardino o di una stanza.

   Tra gli alberi con fiori bianchi più popolari, troviamo il magnolio, il
   ciliegio, l’azalea, il gelsomino e il melo. Questi alberi sono ideali per
   creare un punto focale in un giardino o per aggiungere un tocco di
   eleganza a un paesaggio urbano.

   In conclusione, gli alberi con fiori bianchi sono molto più che semplici
   piante. Sono simboli di purezza, bellezza e rinascita, e possono avere un
   effetto positivo sulla nostra salute mentale. Che tu sia un appassionato
   di giardinaggio, un amante della natura o semplicemente una persona in
   cerca di un po’ di tranquillità, un albero con fiori bianchi può essere
   un’aggiunta preziosa alla tua vita.

   [IMG]Un albero di Natale

   L'albero di Natale è un simbolo allestito in casa o in luoghi pubblici
   durante il periodo natalizio, solitamente una conifera sempreverde come un
   abete o un pino (o una sua imitazione in alluminio) che viene decorato con
   luci natalizie, palline, festoni, fiocchi e spesso una stella (che ricorda
   la stella di Betlemme^[1]) in cima.^[2]^[3] Originario della Germania e
   associato a san Bonifacio,^[4]^[5]^[6] è una delle più diffuse usanze
   della celebrazione del Natale in molti paesi. Un tempo l'albero era sempre
   di origine naturale, di solito un piccolo abete che veniva tagliato nel
   bosco e portato in casa come addobbo natalizio. In epoca industriale
   iniziarono il commercio degli abeti coltivati e degli abeti di materiale
   plastico, in vari formati e colori.^[7]

   L'abete può essere portato in casa o tenuto all'aperto, viene preparato
   qualche giorno o qualche settimana prima di Natale e rimosso dopo
   l'Epifania. Nelle grandi città è d'uso abbellire una delle piazze
   principali con un grande abete.

   Quando l'albero viene collocato in casa, è tradizione in Italia che nei
   pressi o ai suoi piedi venga collocato anche il presepe, come pure siano
   collocati anche i regali di Natale ben impacchettati, in attesa del giorno
   della festa in cui potranno essere aperti.

   Nella tradizione milanese l'albero di natale viene preparato a
   sant'Ambrogio, patrono di Milano, il 7 dicembre; mentre nella tradizione
   barese è allestito a san Nicola, patrono di Bari, il 6 dicembre. Un'altra
   usanza ne prevede la preparazione l'8 dicembre, ovvero durante la
   festività cattolica dell'Immacolata Concezione.

   L'immagine dell'albero come simbolo dell'axis mundi che collega il Cielo
   supremo sede della Divinità (specificamente la stella polare) e la Terra,
   ha origini molto antiche e trova riscontri in diverse religioni.^[8]

Tipi di alberi usati[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   In genere per l'albero di Natale in Italia si usa un peccio (Picea abies)
   detto anche abete rosso; mentre nell'Europa Centrale e nei Paesi nordici è
   comune oltre la "Picea abies", l'uso di abeti (Abies alba o Abies
   nordmanniana); più raramente si usano pini o altre conifere sempreverdi,
   ma possono essere usati anche altri tipi di albero, come per esempio
   Magnolia grandiflora.

   Nel mondo moderno ha una grande diffusione (certamente preponderante nel
   mondo occidentale) l'uso di alberi artificiali (i primi alberi di Natale
   artificiali non verdi ad avere successo commerciale su vasta scala sono
   stati quelli in alluminio). Oltre a risultare pratici ed economici, gli
   alberi artificiali garantiscono soprattutto la salvezza di molte conifere
   che verrebbero usate come alberi di Natale e rappresentano l'unica
   soluzione per coloro che soffrono di allergia alle conifere. Esistono
   alberi artificiali di tutte le dimensioni, da quelli con proporzioni
   realistiche a quelli "da tavolo", di poche decine di centimetri d'altezza.

Ornamenti[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Fra gli ornamenti più diffusi con cui addobbare gli alberi di Natale si
   possono citare le caratteristiche palline (quelle più diffuse sono
   sferiche, poi ne esistono innumerevoli varianti, per esempio coniche, a
   forma di campanella, di pigna e così via), realizzate in vetro soffiato o
   altri materiali generalmente ricoperti da una vernice colorata e
   riflettente o spruzzate d'argento, oro, o bianco. Spesso si usano anche
   fiocchi colorati di tessuto; sono molto diffusi i festoni e i fili
   perlati. File di miniluci elettriche hanno progressivamente sostituito nel
   Novecento l'uso di candele posizionate sui rami; sono di solito colorate o
   intermittenti, e tendono a ricordare luci fatate (specialmente se la loro
   luce è riflessa è diffusa dai festoni o dalle altre decorazioni, o dai
   rami stessi dell'albero). Fra i gadget in commercio già da diversi anni,
   si stanno diffondendo le file di luci elettriche musicali, che
   riproducono, talvolta in sincronia con l'intermittenza, tradizionali
   musiche natalizie come Jingle Bells , White Christmas o All I Want for
   Christmas Is You di Mariah Carey. La cima dell'albero è in genere
   arricchita da un puntale, in genere simile alle palle per colore,
   materiale e tipo di decorazioni, molto spesso a forma di stella, con
   riferimento alla stella cometa. Alcuni spruzzano sui rami dell'albero
   diversi generi di neve artificiale. Si usano inoltre altre decorazioni di
   vario tipo (pupazzi di Babbo Natale, stelle ecc.) da appendere sui rami.

   Fra le decorazioni meno comuni ma dotate di una certa tradizione, si
   possono ricordare la frutta secca; certi tipi di frutta colorata come le
   arance; i biscotti allo zenzero; le decorazioni in pasta di sale o
   marzapane; piccoli personaggi (Babbo Natale, angeli, renne e così via), o
   giocattoli. Talvolta non vi è alcun limite alla creatività di chi addobba
   l'albero, che può quindi essere, pur nella tradizione, estremamente
   "personale". Non è inconsueto, per esempio, che oggetti dotati di un forte
   valore emotivo (per esempio donati da persone care) vengano collocati in
   particolari "posizioni d'onore" sull'albero, a prescindere da
   considerazioni strettamente estetiche.

   Fra i colori più tradizionali delle decorazioni natalizie si devono
   probabilmente citare il rosso, l'oro, il verde e l'argento, ma tutti i
   colori sono ammessi e utilizzati.

  Il puntale[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Il puntale (in inglese tree-topper) è quell'elemento decorativo che viene
   posto sulla punta dell'albero natalizio.

   Nonostante esistano tantissimi tipi di puntale diversi per forma, genere e
   colore, il puntale tradizionale è quello composto da un angelo, che vuole
   rappresentare l'angelo Gabriele durante la sua visita alla casa della
   Vergine Maria per annunciare il prossimo concepimento. È certo che questo
   genere di puntale fu molto comune durante il periodo Vittoriano, ed in
   particolar modo nel Regno Unito. La Rivista Illustrata delle Notizie di
   Londra pubblicò una fotografia della Regina Vittoria, del Principe Alberto
   e della loro famiglia attorno ad un albero natalizio coronato da un
   puntale a forma di angelo. La notevole influenza della Regina, anche in
   ambito modaiolo e culturale, fece sì che l'angioletto divenisse il puntale
   più comune nelle case dei cittadini inglesi.

   Successivamente si sono anche iniziati a utilizzare dei puntali a forma di
   stella, che vogliono rappresentare la Stella Cometa che i Re Magi
   seguirono per raggiungere la grotta della Natività.

  Le luci dell'albero natalizio[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Luci natalizie.
   [IMG]Piazza Portanova, centro storico di Salerno, Natale 2008

   Oltre alle palle colorate e agli addobbi, una peculiarità dell'albero
   natalizio sono le luci elettriche, che vengono poste tutto attorno
   all'albero al fine di creare un gradevole effetto di luci colorate.

   La tradizione di utilizzare lucine elettriche è figlia di una più antica
   tradizione tedesca; quella di addobbare il proprio albero natalizio con
   delle candele, la cui luce era metafora di "Cristo come luce del mondo".

   La diffusione delle luci alimentate ad elettricità è tuttavia stato un
   percorso lungo. Comunemente, lo statunitense Edward H. Johnson è
   considerato il padre dell'albero natalizio come lo conosciamo.
   Quest'ultimo, socio del famoso inventore Thomas Edison, utilizzò per la
   prima volta delle luci elettriche per addobbare l'albero della propria
   abitazione nel 1885. La notizia è giunta sino ai giorni nostri grazie ad
   un articolo che, per l'occasione, fu pubblicato su un quotidiano di
   Detroit.

   Appena dieci anni dopo, nel 1895, anche la Casa Bianca si dotò del proprio
   albero natalizio addobbato con luci elettriche.

   La prima azienda a produrre stringhe luminose per i cittadini fu invece la
   General Electric Co. di Harrison, nel New Jersey. Tuttavia, a causa degli
   allora alti costi di produzione dell'energia elettrica, la quasi totalità
   dei cittadini continuò a preferire le classiche candele di cera per
   addobbare i propri alberi casalinghi, e solo a partire dal 1940 si assiste
   a una graduale sostituzione delle candele con luci elettriche.

  La produzione di massa delle decorazioni natalizie[modifica | modifica
  wikitesto]

   Gli Stati Uniti d'America sono stati il primo paese al mondo a
   "massificare" la produzione e la vendita di ornamenti per gli alberi
   natalizi.

   Tra i primi produttori in assoluto vi fu William DeMuth, di New York, che
   nel 1870 iniziò a produrre in serie delle palline sferiche in vetro a tema
   natalizio. Da quel momento e sino a circa il 1910, decine di piccole
   attività sorsero in giro per gli Stati Uniti, sino a quando il colosso dei
   supermercati americani Woolworth's decise di immettere nel proprio listino
   le decorazioni natalizie, divenendo così il primo rivenditore a livello
   nazionale.

   Il primato di Woolworth's resiste ancora nel ventunesimo secolo, con un
   giro di affari annuale di circa 25 milioni di dollari e un potenziale di
   vendita di circa 200.000 pezzi per singolo articolo presente in listino.

Storia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

  Origine e significato[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Culto dell'albero.
   [IMG]San Bonifacio abbatte l'albero di Thor in'un'incisione di Bernhard
   Rode.

   Una leggenda fa risalire l'usanza al 724, quando nel territorio della
   tribù germanica dei Catti, presso l'attuale Fritzlar, il missionario
   anglosassone Winfrid - poi conosciuto come San Bonifacio - abbattè a colpi
   d'ascia una quercia sacra al dio Thor con l’intento di fermare i sacrifici
   umani che vi avvenivano e convertire quei popoli al cristianesimo e al suo
   posto crebbe un'abete triangolare, che fu associato alla figura di Gesù
   Cristo come simbolo di immortalità e della Trinità (vista la
   forma).^[9]^[10]^[1]^[11]

   Alla base dell'albero natalizio ci sono tuttavia gli antichissimi usi,
   tipici di varie culture, di adorare o di avere alberi sacri, come gli
   Alberi del Paradiso con nastri e oggetti colorati, fiaccole, piccole
   campane, animaletti votivi, e la credenza che le luci, che li
   illuminavano, corrispondessero ad altrettante anime. Allo stesso modo
   venivano ornati anche i vari Alberi cosmici con simboli del Sole, della
   Luna, dei pianeti e delle stelle. In particolare l'abete era sacro a
   Odino, potente dio dei Germani.^[12]

   Gli abitanti dell'estremo Nord dell'Europa, per esempio, dove il sole
   “spariva” per settimane nel pieno dell'inverno, nella settimana precedente
   e successiva al giorno con la notte più lunga, officiavano le solennità
   per auspicare il ritorno del sole e credevano che l'abete rosso fosse in
   grado di esprimere poteri magici, poiché non perdeva le foglie nemmeno nei
   geli dell'inverno: alberi di abete venivano tagliati e portati a casa,
   decorati con frutti, ricordando la fertilità che la primavera avrebbe
   ridato agli alberi. I Romani usavano decorare le loro case con rami di
   pino durante le Calende di gennaio.

   Nel Medioevo i culti pagani vennero generalmente intesi come una
   prefigurazione della rivelazione cristiana. Oltre a significare la potenza
   offerta alla natura da Dio, l'albero divenne quindi simbolo di Cristo,
   inteso come linfa vitale, e della Chiesa, rappresentata come un giardino
   voluto da Dio sulla terra^[13]. Nella Bibbia il simbolo dell'albero è
   peraltro presente più volte e con più significati, a cominciare
   dall'Albero della vita posto al centro del paradiso terrestre (Genesi,
   2.9^[14]) per arrivare all'albero della Croce, passando per l'Albero di
   Jesse^[15]. L'albero natalizio ha una valenza cosmica che lo collega alla
   rinascita della vita dopo l'inverno e al ritorno della fertilità della
   natura. L'albero cosmico o albero della vita è stato anche associato alla
   figura salvifica di Cristo e alla croce della Redenzione, fatta appunto di
   legno. Secondo una pia leggenda, il legno della croce sarebbe stato
   ricavato da un ramoscello dell'Albero della Vita del Paradiso Terrestre
   che l'arcangelo Michele avrebbe donato a Set per portare conforto al padre
   Adamo moribondo.^[16] L'abete, sin dall'epoca egizia è stato posto in
   relazione con la nascita del dio di Biblo, dai Greci fu consacrato ad
   Artemide, protettrice delle nascite e sempre dai Greci era ritenuto
   simbolo della rinascita rappresentata dal nuovo anno.^[17] Sarà poi
   venerato dai popoli dell'Asia settentrionale e, in particolare, dai Celti
   e dai Germani che lo associavano alla nascita del fanciullo divino e a sua
   volta alla festività del solstizio invernale. Per il Cristianesimo l'abete
   diventò simbolo di Cristo e della sua immortalità.^[18]

   [IMG]Il grande albero di Natale allestito in piazza San Pietro a Roma
   (2011)

   La tradizione dell'albero di Natale, così come molte altre tradizioni
   natalizie correlate, è sentita in modo particolare nell'Europa di lingua
   tedesca (si veda per esempio l'usanza dei mercatini di Natale), sia
   cattolica che protestante, sebbene sia ormai universalmente accettata
   anche nel resto del mondo cattolico (che spesso lo affianca al
   tradizionale presepe). A riprova di questo, esiste anche la tradizione,
   introdotta durante il pontificato di Giovanni Paolo II, di allestire un
   grande albero di Natale nel luogo cuore del Cattolicesimo mondiale, piazza
   San Pietro a Roma. D'altronde un'interpretazione allegorica fornita dai
   cattolici spiega l'uso di addobbare l'albero come una celebrazione del
   legno (bois, in francese è sia inteso come "albero" sia come "legno") in
   ricordo della Croce che ha redento il mondo (Padre Thomas Le Gal); si noti
   la similitudine dell'albero con il pilastro cosmico chiamato Yggdrasill
   dalla mitologia nordica, fonte della vita, delle acque eterne, cui è
   vincolato il destino degli uomini: similitudini queste sincreticamente
   assorbite nel culto cristiano che celebra l'albero di Natale e la Croce
   stessa. La similitudine tra albero sacro e Croce fu usata anche dai
   missionari cristiani tra l'VIII e X secolo per convertire i popoli
   germanici dell'Europa centro-settentrionale.

   Il teologo luterano Oscar Cullmann sostiene che l'albero di Natale
   accoglie, certamente, i miti dell'albero, simbolo del rinnovarsi della
   vita, delle antiche genti europee (e asiatiche, amerinde ecc.), ma
   direttamente esso trae la sua origine dagli alberi innalzati, e ornati di
   frutti e altri simboli cristiani, davanti alle cattedrali cristiane:
   durante queste cerimonie, quasi liturgiche, si mettevano in scena episodi
   biblici.

   Alle origini dell'usanza si può però trovare anche un gioco religioso
   medioevale celebrato proprio in Germania il 24 dicembre, il "gioco di
   Adamo e di Eva" (Adam und Eva Spiele), in cui venivano riempite le piazze
   e le chiese di alberi di frutta e simboli dell'abbondanza per ricreare
   l'immagine del Paradiso. Successivamente gli alberi da frutto vennero
   sostituiti da abeti poiché questi ultimi avevano una profonda valenza
   "magica" per il popolo. Avevano specialmente il dono di essere
   sempreverdi, dono che secondo la tradizione gli venne dato proprio dallo
   stesso Gesù come ringraziamento per averlo protetto mentre era inseguito
   da nemici. Non a caso, sempre in Germania, l'abete era anche il posto in
   cui venivano posati i bambini portati dalla cicogna.

  Diffusione in Europa e nel mondo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]L’albero di Natale di Martin Lutero (1860), incisione di J.
   Bannister.

   L'uso moderno dell'albero nelle celebrazioni pubbliche nasce, secondo lo
   storico amatoriale livone Friedrich Amelung, a Tallinn, in Estonia, nel
   1441,^[19] quando fu eretto un grande abete nella piazza Raekoja, la
   piazza del Municipio, attorno al quale giovani scapoli, uomini e donne,
   ballavano insieme alla ricerca dell'anima gemella. Anche la città di Riga,
   in Lettonia, è fra quelle che si proclamano sedi del primo albero di
   Natale della storia (vi si trova una targa scritta in otto lingue, secondo
   cui il "primo albero di Capodanno" fu addobbato nella città nel 1510).
   Entrambe le rivendicazioni in realtà sono probabilmente errate e non si
   trattava con certezza di alberi^[20]^[21].

   Secondo altre fonti^[22] l'albero di Natale come è conosciuto sarebbe
   originario della regione di Basilea in Svizzera dove se ne trovano tracce
   risalenti al XIII secolo.

   L'usanza, originariamente intesa come legata alla vita pubblica, entrò
   nelle case a partire dal XVI secolo^[10]. Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann,
   professoressa di etnologia a Marburgo, ha identificato, fra i primi
   riferimenti storici alla tradizione, una cronaca di Brema del 1570,
   secondo cui un albero veniva decorato con mele, noci, datteri e fiori di
   carta^[10]. La leggenda vuole che sia stata una trovata del fondatore del
   protestantesimo, Martin Lutero, rimasto incantato da un abete nel bosco la
   notte di Natale tanto da portarlo a casa propria dai suoi bambini come
   simbolo della nascita di Cristo, e agli inizi del XVIII secolo era già
   pratica comune in tutte le città della Renania^[23]. L'uso di candele per
   addobbare i rami dell'albero è attestato già in quel secolo e la leggenda
   ne attribuisce l'origine pure a Lutero, che con esse volle simboleggiare
   le stelle create da Dio.^[23]

   Per molto tempo, la tradizione dell'albero di Natale rimase tipica delle
   regioni a nord del Reno, mentre era meno diffusa nelle regioni germaniche
   più a sud, dove i cattolici lo consideravano un uso protestante. Furono
   gli ufficiali prussiani, dopo il Congresso di Vienna, a contribuire alla
   sua diffusione negli anni successivi. A Vienna l'albero di Natale apparve
   nel 1816, per volere della principessa Henrietta von Nassau-Weilburg, ed
   in Francia nel 1840, introdotto da Elena di Meclemburgo-Schwerin duchessa
   d'Orléans. Nei primi anni del secolo, inoltre, in Svizzera e Germania si
   iniziò a produrre e a commerciare gli alberi di Natale, che divennero così
   parte del consumismo.

   [IMG]Illustrazione raffigurante la regina Vittoria, il principe Alberto e
   i loro bambini mentre ammirano il Reale Albero di Natale nel dicembre
   1848.

   Un contributo decisivo alla sua diffusione venne anche dalla Gran
   Bretagna: a metà del XIX secolo, infatti, il principe Alberto di
   Sassonia-Coburgo-Gotha, marito della regina Vittoria, date le sue origini
   germaniche volle introdurre nelle proprie residenze l'uso a lui familiare
   dell'albero di Natale; la novità si estese presto come una moda in tutto
   il Regno Unito, e da lì a tutto il mondo anglosassone.^[24]

   Il primo albero di Natale elettricamente illuminato fu creato da Edward H.
   Johnson, un socio dell'inventore Thomas Edison. Mostrò con orgoglio il suo
   albero di Natale, che era cablato a mano con 80 lampadine a incandescenza
   elettriche rosse, bianche e blu, da una misura simila a noce, il 22
   dicembre 1882 nella sua casa sulla Fifth Avenue a New York City.^[25] Nel
   1895, il presidente degli Stati Uniti Grover Cleveland sponsorizzò con
   orgoglio alla Casa Bianca il primo albero di Natale illuminato
   elettricamente con centinaia di lampadine elettriche multicolori.^[26]

   In Italia la prima ad addobbare un albero di Natale fu la regina
   Margherita nella seconda metà dell'Ottocento al Quirinale, e da lei la
   moda si diffuse velocemente in tutto il Paese: non a caso l'albero di
   Natale è una delle poche tradizioni straniere ad essere arrivate in Italia
   prima della sua diffusione, di tipo più consumistico, del secondo
   dopoguerra.

   Nei primi anni del Novecento gli alberi di Natale hanno conosciuto un
   momento di grande diffusione, diventando gradualmente quasi immancabili
   nelle case dei cittadini sia europei che nordamericani, e venendo a
   rappresentare il simbolo del Natale probabilmente più comune a livello
   planetario. Nel dopoguerra il fenomeno ha acquisito una dimensione
   commerciale e consumistica senza precedenti, che ha fatto dell'albero di
   Natale un potenziale status symbol e ha dato luogo, insieme alle
   tradizioni correlate, alla nascita di una vera e propria industria
   dell'addobbo natalizio.

La coltivazione dell'albero di Natale[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Produzione degli alberi di Natale.

   Coltivare pini, abeti rossi ed abeti sempreverdi da vendere durante le
   festività natalizie è un'attività lavorativa ben radicata nei paesi
   anglofoni, in particolar modo negli Stati Uniti d'America e in Canada.

   La prima azienda specializzata nella coltivazione di alberi natalizi
   nacque nel 1901 negli Stati Uniti, più precisamente nello Stato del New
   Jersey^[27]. Tuttavia sino a circa il 1940 la quasi totalità dei cittadini
   americani continuò, durante le festività, a tagliare i propri alberi dalle
   foreste. Questo poiché, nell'immaginario collettivo di allora, gli alberi
   coltivati dalle aziende private erano percepiti come alberi di medio-bassa
   qualità. Tale visione è poi gradualmente cambiata con il procedere del XX
   secolo, soprattutto grazie alle innovazioni colturali e tecnologiche
   avvenute nel settore agricolo.

   A partire dal 1950 si è poi assistito a un costante aumento delle aziende
   attive in questo settore, sospinte soprattutto da una sempre maggiore
   domanda, anche a seguito della crescente urbanizzazione della popolazione
   statunitense.

   Sino all'inizio degli anni '80 il mercato degli alberi natalizi vide una
   continua espansione, per poi iniziare lentamente a contrarsi sul finire
   dello stesso decennio. Ciononostante, circa il 98% degli alberi natalizi
   vivi venduti in giro per il mondo provengono da aziende di coltivazione
   specializzate^[senza fonte].

  Impatti culturali della coltivazione[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]Alberi natalizi in vendita provenienti da una coltivazione
   specializzata

   Con il passare dei decenni visitare queste aziende nel periodo pre
   natalizio è divenuta una vera e propria tradizione americana, con le
   stesse aziende che hanno favorito ed incoraggiato il più possibile questa
   tendenza.

   Per esempio nello Stato del Minnesota, è una vera tradizione familiare
   quella di scattarsi delle fotografie sotto gli alberi natalizi, appena
   prima di essere acquistati. Le famiglie possono inoltre "prenotare" degli
   alberi per gli anni a venire, che saranno tagliati solo quando
   l'acquirente sarà soddisfatto della grandezza dell'albero.

   Esistono poi aziende che, servendo intere famiglie per generazioni, sono
   divenute dei veri e propri punti di riferimento per le festività di molti
   cittadini.

   Tra le molte opportunità offerte da queste aziende, vi è anche quella di
   poter tagliare da sé l'albero natalizio prescelto. Ma non solo: durante il
   periodo natalizio, all'interno di queste coltivazione, non è inusuale
   trovare la casa di Babbo Natale, dove oltre alle fotografie e alle
   letterine portate dai bambini viene anche offerto ai visitatori del sidro
   di mele o della cioccolata calda. In alcune delle aziende più grandi si
   organizzano anche delle corse su slitte trainate da cani o cavalli.

   Le imprese coltivatrici si sono quindi aperte al pubblico, ed hanno
   affiancato alla propria attività commerciale una sfera del tutto
   emozionale, maggiormente accattivante per le famiglie che intendono
   raggiungere con i propri prodotti.

   Contrariamente a quanto si possa credere, negli Stati Uniti ci sono delle
   associazioni che sostengono l'utilizzo di alberi natalizi vivi, rispetto a
   quelli artificiali. Per esempio la National Christmas Tree Association
   (NCTA) ha dichiarato che ogni ettaro di alberi natalizi in coltivazione
   produce giornalmente una quantità di ossigeno bastevole per circa 39
   persone, e che la produzione americana (circa 200.000 ettari) produce
   ossigeno giornaliero per circa 9 milioni di cittadini^[28].

Il Chichilaki[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Chichilaki.

   Il Chichilaki è un particolare tipo di albero di Natale, prodotto in
   Georgia sfogliando rami di nocciolo o di noce, ottenendo così un ramo con
   delle fronde arricciate molto leggere, a cui vengono attaccati frutti
   secchi.

   La cittadina di Anthem, in Arizona, è famosa per ospitare annualmente
   all'interno del proprio centro commerciale l'albero natalizio vivo più
   alto degli Stati Uniti d'America. Nel 2015 l'albero aveva la considerevole
   altezza di 35 metri.

    L'albero della città di Boston[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]L'albero natalizio di Boston nel 2010

   La città di Boston ospita e addobba il proprio albero natalizio dal
   lontano 1941, e dal 1971 è donato annualmente all'amministrazione comunale
   da dei ricchi cittadini residenti nella Nuova Scozia, in Canada. La scelta
   dell'albero da donare è un procedimento complesso che prevede addirittura
   la formazione temporanea di un team di specialisti, i quali nei mesi
   antecedenti il Natale hanno il compito di stilare una lista di papabili
   alberi da destinare al taglio. L'attività di censimento e compilazione
   inizia generalmente nei mesi di giugno e luglio. A tal fine il
   Dipartimento delle Risorse Naturali della Nuova Scozia ha stilato un
   vademecum per selezionare al meglio l'albero da tagliare. Per esempio
   l'albero non deve superare l'altezza di 16 metri e non deve provenire da
   un'azienda di coltivazione privata, ma deve essere tagliato nella
   foresta^[29].

   Il giorno del taglio dell'albero si svolge una vera e propria cerimonia
   che vede la presenza di decine di scolaresche locali, del console degli
   Stati Uniti in Nuova Scozia e della Polizia Montana Canadese^[30].

   Dopo il taglio l'albero viaggia per circa 1200 km prima di giungere a
   Boston. Parte del viaggio è fatto su un apposito camion, la restante parte
   avviene invece a bordo di un traghetto^[31].

   Non appena entrato a Boston l'albero viene simbolicamente "scortato" dalla
   Polizia cittadina, durante una piccola parata per le vie cittadine a cui
   assistono numerose scolaresche^[32].

   Alla fine l'albero giunge nel suo luogo definitivo, ovvero nel parco
   pubblico Boston Common. L'evento della deposizione dell'albero attira
   annualmente circa 20 000 visitatori^[33], a cui si aggiungono le circa
   200 000 persone che assistono all'evento grazie alla diretta
   televisiva^[34].

   La decorazione dell'albero richiede poi l'impiego di molti uomini e
   centinaia di ore di lavoro. Per fare un esempio, nel 1998 furono necessari
   7 km di cavi elettrici per illuminare l'intera superficie
   dell'albero^[35], e nel 2006 furono utilizzati circa 8.000 bulbi
   luminosi^[36].

    L'albero della città di Chicago[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Il primo albero natalizio addobbato dalla municipalità di Chicago risale
   al 1917, anno in cui fu posto nel Grant Park. Era alto 11 metri.

   Da quell'anno e fino ai giorni nostri a Chicago viene annualmente decorato
   un grande albero natalizio.

   Particolarità dell'albero di Chicago era quello di essere composto da più
   alberi messi insieme. A titolo di esempio nel 2008 l'albero fu realizzato
   con 113 alberi ed era alto 26 metri circa. Il 2008 fu tuttavia l'ultimo
   anno in cui si assistette a questa bizzarra tradizione, in quanto dal 2009
   il Municipio di Chicago decise di utilizzare un singolo albero, al fine di
   risparmiare sugli alti costi di installazione ed addobbo registrati negli
   anni precedenti (circa 300.000$).

    L'albero della città di Los Angeles[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero che annualmente viene addobbato a Los Angeles (California),
   chiamato Grove Christmas Tree, è un albero vivo di circa 30 metri di
   altezza che sul finire di novembre viene posizionato all'interno del
   centro commerciale The Grove^[37].

   La sua presenza a Los Angeles si attesta solo dal 2002, anno in cui il
   magnate Rick J. Caruso acquista il grande lotto terriero in cui poi
   sorgerà il centro commerciale The Grove. Tuttavia, la spettacolarità delle
   sue luci ha fatto sì che questo albero rivaleggi per bellezza con lo
   storico albero natalizio del Rockefeller Center di Manhattan a New
   York^[38]. Tradizionalmente, l'albero del The Grove proviene dalle foreste
   presente nel Nord della California.

   Ogni anno l'albero viene inaugurato con l'accensione delle luci, durante
   una solenne celebrazione accompagnata da un grande spettacolo. Negli anni,
   all'interno del centro commerciale The Grove, hanno offerto la loro
   performance attori del cinema e cantanti internazionali, tra cui i The
   Backstreet Boys^[39].

    L'albero della città di Milwaukee[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero della città di Milwaukee è tradizionalmente posto di fronte al
   palazzo comunale. La tradizione è iniziata nel 1913 e continua ancora nel
   ventunesimo secolo.

   Come in molte altre città americane, non è insolito che l'albero venga
   annualmente donato da dei privati cittadini.

   Gli stessi cittadini di Milwaukee, inoltre, hanno richiesto la formazione
   di un team di specialisti addetti all'individuazione dell'albero natalizio
   per la città. Questi ultimi, devono obbligatoriamente scegliere un albero
   dello Stato del Colorado, che abbia un'altezza compresa tra i 10 e i 15
   metri e la cui cima sia facilmente raggiungibile con una gru^[40].

   Tradizione vuole che l'albero venga accesso durante una cerimonia alle ore
   17:15 in punto.

    L'albero della città di Washington[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Ogni anno, nelle immediate vicinanze della Casa Bianca a Washington, si
   addobba un grande albero conosciuto con il nome di National Christmas
   Tree. L'albero è addobbato in occasione delle festività natalizie sin dal
   1923.

   Ogni Presidente degli Stati Uniti, a partire da Franklin D. Roosevelt, ha
   tenuto un discorso durante la cerimonia di accensione delle luci
   dell'albero natalizio^[41].

    L'albero del Rockefeller Center a New York[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Albero di Natale del Rockefeller Center.

   L'albero di Rockefeller Center può essere inteso come il simbolo principe
   del Natale newyorkese.

   Ogni anno l'albero viene trasportato ed eretto a Manhattan verso la metà
   di Novembre. L'accensione delle luci si svolge durante una sontuosa
   cerimonia pubblica, e dal 1997 l'evento è onorato della diretta TV negli
   Stati Uniti. Tradizionalmente il tasto di accensione delle luci viene
   pigiato dal Sindaco di New York, accompagnato per l'occasione da ospiti di
   fama internazionale^[42]. Si stima che ogni anni circa 125 milioni di
   persone visitino l'albero di Rockefeller Center^[43].

   Tradizionalmente il grande pino utilizzato proviene dalle foreste
   norvegesi ed ha un'altezza compresa tra i 21 ed 30 metri^[44].

  Europa[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

    L’albero di Natale di Piazza San Pietro[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   La tradizione dell’albero di Natale in piazza San Pietro è stata avviata
   nel 1982 per volere di Giovanni Paolo II, che quell’anno aveva ricevuto in
   dono un abete da un contadino polacco portato dall’uomo fino a Roma.

   Da allora è tradizione che ogni anno ogni regione europea porti in dono un
   gigantesco abete proveniente dai propri boschi per essere poi issato al
   centro della piazza, accanto al presepe anch’esso offerto ogni anno da una
   diversa località del mondo.

   In riferimento a questa usanza, oggi acquisita anche da alcune famiglie
   cristiane, di addobbare un albero nel periodo natalizio, la congregazione
   per il culto scrive: "A prescindere dalle sue origini storiche, l'albero
   di Natale è oggi un simbolo fortemente evocativo, assai diffuso negli
   ambienti cristiani; evoca sia l’albero della vita piantato al centro
   dell'Eden (cf. Gn 2, 9), sia l’albero della croce, e assume quindi un
   significato cristologico. Sotto l'albero si possono aggiungere dei "doni";
   tuttavia, tra i doni posti non dovrà mancare quello per i poveri: essi
   fanno parte di ogni famiglia cristiana".^[45]

   In piazza San Pietro l'albero e il presepe vengono solitamente inaugurati
   la sera del 7 dicembre, vigilia della festa dell’Immacolata Concezione, e
   spenti il giorno della solennità del battesimo del Signore, la domenica
   successiva alla festa dell’Epifania, che secondo il calendario liturgico
   conclude il tempo di Natale.

    L'albero della città di Londra[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]L'albero di Trafalgar Square nel 2011

   Nella capitale del Regno Unito l'albero natalizio è tradizionalmente
   posizionato a Trafalgar Square. Sin dal 1947 l'albero è donato ai
   cittadini britannici dagli abitanti di Oslo, in Norvegia^[46], come
   ringraziamento per l'aiuto ricevuto durante la seconda guerra mondiale.

   Dal giorno in cui viene eretto l'albero Trafalgar Square diviene per circa
   un mese il punto centrale di tutte le attività natalizie della capitale
   britannica.

   L'albero utilizzato è tradizionalmente un pino norvegese con un'età di
   circa 60 anni e un'altezza minima di 20 metri. Il pino è tagliato sul
   finire di novembre durante una cerimonia pubblica a cui partecipa anche
   l'ambasciatore britannico in Norvegia. L'albero raggiunge poi il Regno
   Unito a bordo di un battello. Una volta giunto nella capitale, l'albero è
   addobbato con ornamenti in stile norvegese, a cui si aggiungono 500 luci
   di colore bianco.

   Alla base dell'albero è poi posta una lastra, che recita le seguenti
   parole: "Questo albero è stato donato dalla città di Oslo, come gesto di
   gratitudine Norvegese nei confronti della gente di Londra, per
   l'assistenza ricevuta negli anni 1940-1945. Un albero è donato ogni anno
   dal 1947".

   L'albero è infine acceso durante una cerimonia pubblica il primo giovedì
   di Dicembre, a cui assistono centinaia di persone.^[47]

    L'albero della città di Bruxelles[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero è tradizionalmente posto nella Grand Place della città, è alto
   all'incirca 20 metri e proviene dalle foreste delle Ardenne^[48].
   Dall'anno 2000, la piazza ospita anche i mercatini di Natale della
   capitale belga.^[49]

    L'Albero di Natale di Gubbio[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'Albero di Natale di Gubbio è il più grande del mondo e viene realizzato
   sul Monte Ingino, dominante la cittadina umbra. Non si tratta di un vero
   albero, bensì del disegno colossale di un albero di Natale realizzato con
   centinaia di sorgenti luminose, che lo rendono visibile in lontananza da
   Gubbio.

   L’idea dell’abete come rappresentazione della vita eterna proviene dal
   mondo pagano ma venne, poi, ripreso dai cristiani, che ne fecero il
   simbolo di Cristo stesso.

   Nei secoli poi si sono sviluppate moltissime altre leggende e teorie
   attorno all’albero di Natale. Secondo alcuni studiosi, per esempio,
   l’abete fu scelto dai Cristiani fra tutti gli alberi sempreverdi per la
   sua forma triangolare, che rappresenterebbe la Santa Trinità.

   Il primo vero albero di Natale, così come lo conosciamo noi, fu introdotto
   in Germania nel 1611 dalla Duchessa di Brieg che, secondo la leggenda,
   aveva già fatto adornare il suo castello per festeggiare il Natale, quando
   si accorse che un angolo di una delle sale dell’edificio era rimasto
   completamente vuoto. Per questo, ordinò che un abete del giardino del
   castello venisse trapiantato in un vaso e portato in quella sala.

Come è nata la tradizione di addobbare un abete per celebrare il Natale? Te lo
diciamo noi!

   Nel nostro Paese, a dicembre è tradizione decorare l'albero di Natale, il
   tipico abete. Ma vi siete mai chiesti come sia nata questa usanza?

Le origini

   Si pensa sia nata in ambito pagano: poiché l’abete è una pianta
   sempreverde, i Druidi - i sacerdoti celti - fecero di quest'albero un
   simbolo di vita e lo onoravano in varie cerimonie. Anche i Romani,  alle
   calende di gennaio (il primo giorno di quel mese), usavano regalarsi un
   rametto di una pianta sempreverde come augurio di buona fortuna.

   L’idea dell’abete come rappresentazione della vita eterna venne, poi,
   ripreso dai cristiani, che ne fecero il simbolo di Cristo stesso oppure,
   secondo altre leggende, dell’albero della vita di cui parla la Bibbia o di
   quello del bene e del male, che crescevano entrambi nell’Eden.

   Nei secoli poi si sono sviluppate moltissime altre leggende e teorie
   attorno all’albero di Natale. Secondo alcuni studiosi, per esempio,
   l’abete fu scelto dai Cristiani fra tutti gli alberi sempreverdi per la
   sua forma triangolare, che rappresenterebbe la Santa Trinità.

L'albero di Natale

   Tuttavia, il primo vero albero di Natale, così come lo conosciamo noi, fu
   introdotto in Germania nel 1611 dalla Duchessa di Brieg che, secondo la
   leggenda, aveva già fatto adornare il suo castello per festeggiare il
   Natale, quando si accorse che un angolo di una delle sale dell’edificio
   era rimasto completamente vuoto. Per questo, ordinò che un abete del
   giardino del castello venisse trapiantato in un vaso e portato in quella
   sala.

   In Francia, invece, il primo albero di Natale fu addobbato nel 1840 dalla
   duchessa d’Orleans. I cattolici, infatti, dopo la riforma di Martin Lutero
   (1483-1546), consideravano un’usanza protestante quella di decorare alberi
   per celebrare il Natale.  Inizialmente c'era un po' di diffidenza...

   Furono soprattutto i prussiani, i "predecessori" dei tedeschi, a
   contribuire alla sua diffusione anche all’interno dei paesi non toccati
   dalla riforma di Lutero. A Tallinn (Estonia), per esempio, già nel 1441,
   fu eretto un grande abete nella piazza del municipio, attorno al quale
   uomini e donne non sposati ballavano alla ricerca di un’anima gemella .

Altri simboli caratteristici del Natale

   Il presepe, un altro elemento tipico della tradizione natalizia di molti
   paesi, invece, è stato inventato proprio da un famosissimo italiano: San
   Francesco d’Assisi! 

   Durante la notte di  Natale del 1223, a Greccio (Lazio), il santo rievocò
   la nascita di Gesù attraverso la prima vera rappresentazione vivente
   dell’evento. In più, celebrò la Santa Messa e tenne una famosa predica in
   modo da rendere comprensibile la vicenda a cui stavano assistendo anche a
   coloro che non sapevano leggere le Sacre Scritture. Secondo la leggenda,
   il fantoccio usato per raffigurare Gesù Bambino prese vita più volte,
   durante la messa, fra le braccia di San Francesco.

   Oggi, in Francia, i presepi sono diventati una tradizione molto importante
   per la celebrazione del Natale e particolarmente famosi sono quelli della
   regione della Provenza, chiamati “Santons”.

   Nei presepi spagnoli, invece, ai personaggi classici si affiancano Tio -
   un tronchetto d’albero che, se scosso, sprigiona dolcetti - e Caganer, un
   porta fortuna natalizio.

   mettere luci e palline: ecco le istruzioni passo passo per addobbare un
   albero di Natale da film

   Addobbare l'albero di Natale sembra un gioco da ragazzi, ma non lo è.

   ** 10 addobbi natalizi che vi invidieranno tutti **

   Per ottenere un risultato che valga la foto di rito da condividere sui
   social network, ci vogliono metodo e attenzione ai dettagli.

   ** 5 trucchi per fare foto davvero instagrammabili alle lucine e
   all'albero di Natale **

   Quali? 

   ** Ecco cosa dice della vostra personalità il modo in cui addobbate
   l'albero di Natale **

   Abbiamo stilato un vademecum che spieghi passo passo come addobbare un
   albero di Natale degno di questo nome, di quelli ricchi, pieni di
   decorazioni e, in una parola, invidiabili.

   ** Chi fa l'albero di Natale in anticipo è una persona più felice della
   media (lo dice la scienza) **

   Dalla scelta dell'albero al posizionamento di luci e addobbi, ecco come
   addobbare un albero di Natale perfetto con i segreti dei Christmas Stylist
   del villaggio di Natale di Agri Brianza, dove, per i più volenterosi,
   vengono anche organizzati dei corsi a livello base e avanzato.

   ** Quanto ne sapete sul Natale? Mettetevi alla prova con il nostro quiz **

   Perché è solo seguendo delle regole ben precise che si ottiene un albero
   da film americano.

Come addobbare l'albero di Natale perfetto: ecco le regole

   (Continua sotto la foto)

   come-si-sceglie-albero1come-si-sceglie-albero1

Quanto deve essere alto l'albero di Natale

   Si parte dalla dimensione: prendete le misure del soffitto di casa e
   calcolate che diametro potrà avere al massimo la base.

   Se il soffitto è molto alto, ma lo spazio è limitato, meglio cercare
   alberi da un diametro minore senza rinunciare all'altezza.

   La regola vuole che la punta dell'albero arrivi a 50 centimetri dal
   soffitto.

   come-si-sceglie-un-albero1come-si-sceglie-un-albero1

Come si riconosce un albero bello

   La seconda variante da tenere in considerazione riguarda il numero di
   rami: più rami (e rametti su ogni ramo) ci sono, più bello sarà il vostro
   albero.

   Il materiale, poi, non è da sottovalutare: spendere un po' di più vi
   assicurerà un abete perfetto per molti Natali a venire e non rischierete
   di trovarlo spelacchiato l'anno successivo quando lo tirerete fuori dalla
   cantina.

   I migliori sono quelli con gli aghi corti e sagomati e molti rametti corti
   sulla punta.

   come-aprire-i-rami1come-aprire-i-rami1

Come si apre l'albero di Natale

   L'apertura dei rami è un momento fondamentale.

   Quelli più vicini al tronco si aprono fino a essere perpendicolari al
   tronco, quelli esterni invece vanno sagomati uno a uno, dando ai rametti
   finali una leggera curvatura verso il basso, per ottenere un effetto
   simile a quello che hanno gli abeti in natura.

   Se l'albero è bello e i rami vengono aperti bene, basterebbero le luci per
   un risultato di tutto rispetto.

   scegliete-le-luci1scegliete-le-luci1

Come si scelgono le luci per l'albero di Natale

   Le luci sono fondamentali per un albero di Natale e da sole fanno gran
   parte del lavoro, quindi vale la pena pensare bene alla luce che si
   preferisce - o a quale si abbina meglio ai nostri addobbi o all'arredo di
   casa.

   La prima distinzione, che vale anche se si scelgono le luci bianche, è tra
   illuminazione fredda o calda.

   Non ce n'è una migliore, conta solo il vostro gusto personale.

   L'unica cosa importante è far caso al colore del filo, perché se avete un
   albero chiaro non dovrete scegliere il filo scuro e viceversa. Con quello
   trasparente non si sbaglia.

   come-mettere-le-luci1come-mettere-le-luci1

Quante luci servono 

   Per un buon risultato servono tante, tantissime, luci.

   In generale la regola è che ci vogliano 300 luci per ogni metro di altezza
   dell'albero.

   Per il retro non ne servono molte, ma è sempre meglio metterne
   qualcuna per illuminare il muro dietro.

   innanzitutto1innanzitutto1

Come mettere le luci sull'albero

   Innanzitutto provatele prima di montarle, in modo da non vanificare ore di
   lavoro per poi scoprire che un filo non si accende.

   Poi fissate i connettori al tronco: si inizia sempre dal lato della presa
   elettrica e il punto di partenza è sul tronco dell'albero, non a lato o in
   un punto qualsiasi sotto la base. 

   come-mettere-le-luci-di-natale1come-mettere-le-luci-di-natale1

Come si mettono le luci sui rami

   Non arrotolate le luci intorno all'albero: partendo dal tronco fate
   scorrere il filo di luci lungo il ramo fino alla punta, fategli fare un
   giro intorno alla cima di un rascello per fissarlo e tornate al tronco (o
   quasi) prima di spostarvi al rametto successivo.

   In questo modo le luci daranno profondità all'albero e l'effetto sarà
   pieno e bellissimo.

   E soprattutto non ci sarà una ragnatela di fili elettrici tra le palline.

Come si mettono gli addobbi

   Dopo aver riempito di luci il vostro albero, passate agli addobbi,
   seguendo una sola regola: non metteteli mai in fila, né verticale, né
   orizzontale.

   La disposizione dovrà essere omogenea ma apparentemente casuale.

A proposito di dimensioni

   Al contrario di quanto si potrebbe pensare, non è necessario mettere gli
   addobbi pù grandi in basso e quelli più piccoli in alto.

   Le palline più grandi possono tranquillamente essere messe su tutta
   l'altezza dell'albero, l'importante è che ci siano anche quelle piccole
   distribuite nel mezzo per armonizzare il risultato.

Sfruttate la profondità

   Grandi o piccoli che siano i vostri addobbi, non limitatevi ad appenderli
   sulla punta del ramo, sfruttate tutta la profondità dell'albero.

   L'obiettivo è che ad albero finito non si veda più il muro dietro di lui.

Di che colore addobbare l'albero

   È solo ed esclusivamente gusto personale, anche se di anno in anno ci sono
   tendenze che prendono piede più di altre.

   In ogni caso, non lasciatevi intimorire e osate con abbinamenti di colore
   nuovi, oltre ai grandi classici.

   La regola dice che per un risultato ottimale si debbano mischiare tra i
   quattro e i sette colori.

Cosa fare quando gli addobbi sono tutti diversi 

   Gli adepti delle palline tramandate in famiglia (e quelli che
   le collezionano nei viaggi fatti intorno al mondo) dovranno avere una sola
   accortezza: scegliere una decorazione neutra da distribuire in tutto
   l'albero, in mezzo agli altri addobbi, in modo da creare continuità
   all'occhio.

   Possono essere palline piccole, rametti, fiori o fiocchi.

Cosa può finire sull'albero di Natale

   Sull'albero può andare di tutto.

   Non limitatevi necessariamente a quello che viene venduto come addobbo,
   potete adagiare sul vostro albero peluches, fotografie, biscotti o oggetti
   di ogni genere: tutto può diventare un addobbo - e più rispecchierà quello
   che vi piace più verrà personale e bello.

   scegliete-il-tema1scegliete-il-tema1

La regola finale 

   Non lesinate, quando si parla di Natale more is more e ogni tocco in più
   che darete all'albero lo renderà più ricco.

   Quindi, date sfogo a tutta la vostra creatività e liberate il folletto
   natalizio che è in voi: è il suo momento!

   Albero della vita

         L’Albero della Vita: un simbolo antico e ricco di significato

Ripartiamo con un simbolo di prosperità…

   Elegante e rigoglioso: l’albero della vita è un simbolo che ricorre sin
   dall’antichità dalla Cabala al cristianesimo, dalle filosofie orientali ai
   racconti mitologici.

   Ma qual è il suo significato? In tutte le differenti culture, l’albero
   della vita è considerato come sorgente di vita. Il significato è anche
   quello di fonte generatrice da cui ha origine ogni essere vivente. Il
   simbolo dei legami più cari che ognuno ha nelle diverse fasi della vita.

   È composto infatti dalle radici che devono essere ben salde e andare in
   profondità: in questo senso l’albero ricorda la famiglia, punto di origine
   e partenza di ciascuno, legame saldo e indissolubile. Nell’albero della
   vita sono poi presenti il tronco, solito e resistente, sostegno di
   numerosi rami e le foglie simbolo di prosperità. L’albero della vita è
   quindi un intreccio tra la forza della vita generatrice da cui crescono
   rami e foglie e la ricchezza del frutto generato, simbolo di abbondanza.

Abbiamo scelto questo simbolo per questo particolare momento.

   I gioielli da sempre ricordano momenti importanti della vita,
   simboleggiano i cambiamenti, le evoluzioni, il coraggio delle scelte, la
   forza delle decisioni.

   Questo simbolo rappresenta la nuova vita, la nuova normalità, come da
   molti è stata definita, in questo periodo di quarantena dove tutti abbiamo
   avuto modo di riflettere di più, abbiamo dato ancora più importanza alle
   nostre radici, alla famiglia. Ora, in questo momento di ripartenza, ci
   auguriamo tutti che il tronco, solido e resistente, anzi resiliente, come
   la nostra Italia di questi mesi, sviluppi rami ancora più forti e chiome
   rigogliose.

   Rappresenta quindi un simbolo di rinascita e buon auspicio di prosperità
   per tutti noi.

In quali occasioni si regala un gioiello con l’albero della vita?

   L’albero è quindi un simbolo sia di nascita che di rinascita. Regalare un
   gioiello che rappresenta l’albero della vita, come il meraviglioso
   ciondolo Tree Pendant, può assumere come significato quello di essere un
   augurio per un inizio nella vita, metaforico o letterale.

  L’albero della Vita: un simbolo unico per la famiglia

   Per il suo forte richiamo alla stabilità e alle radici, l’albero della
   vita è strettamente legato al concetto di famiglia, base solida di ciascun
   individuo.

   È un simbolo che ricorda come, anche se le tempeste possono far cadere
   delle foglie, il tronco e le radici restano saldi, insieme.

   È un meraviglioso simbolo di speranza e forza, legato anche all’unione tra
   generazioni diverse: nelle radici quelle più anziane, nelle foglie quelle
   più giovani.

  Albero della Vita: immagine perfetta per il Matrimonio

   Proprio per questo suo legame con il senso della famiglia ma anche come
   metafora di un nuovo inizio, l’Albero della Vita è uno dei simboli più
   scelti per il Matrimonio. Il matrimonio rappresenta infatti la nascita di
   una nuova famiglia in un legame di unione tra due alberi genealogici che
   ne creano uno nuovo che crescerà negli anni con la nascita dei figli.

   fedi life albero della vita

   Molte coppie di sposi scelgono questo simbolo come tema di tutto il loro
   Matrimonio e, chiaramente, anche per le loro fedi, come augurio di una
   vita fruttuosa e solida.

   L'albero, in meccanica, è un organo di trasmissione di un moto rotatorio.

Usi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero ha una grandissima quantità di applicazioni in tutti i campi
   della trasmissione del moto. Per fare un esempio domestico, l'estremità
   del frullatore, su cui si innesta il vaso, è un giunto collegato
   all'albero di un motore elettrico.

   Nei mezzi di trasporto, vi è una grande quantità di alberi: nei motori a
   pistoni abbiamo l'albero motore, detto anche albero a gomiti o albero
   eccentrico, o collo d'oca che converte il moto alternativo dei pistoni in
   rotatorio, in quanto parte del sistema di manovellismo biella-manovella.

   Questo, nelle automobili, è connesso alla scatola del cambio, in cui
   alloggiano l'albero primario e l'albero secondario; la scatola trasferisce
   quindi il moto a un albero di trasmissione che, a sua volta e tramite il
   differenziale, lo trasmette agli alberi delle ruote detti anche semiassi.
   Numerosi alberi poi fanno parte dei sistemi ausiliari, quali le pompe, il
   tergicristallo eccetera. Ma in tutte le applicazioni di meccanica si
   trovano impieghi di alberi, nelle forme più varie.

L'albero dal punto di vista meccanico[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]Albero sollecitato a flessione

   Come si è detto, l'albero trasmette un moto rotatorio; esso è quindi
   sottoposto a uno sforzo di torsione; nella maggior parte dei casi, a causa
   di masse collegate all'albero stesso, esso è anche sottoposto a sforzo di
   flessione. In figura la linea rossa mostra l'inflessione di un albero
   supportato in due punti e recante a sbalzo una massa, che genera una forza
   peso F. Per le leggi della scienza delle costruzioni, quindi, l'albero
   dovrà essere dotato di opportuni supporti. Si pone, quindi, il problema
   dell'attrito tra la parte rotante (albero) e quella stazionaria
   (supporto), di cui è parte essenziale la definizione di giochi e
   interferenze.

   Per evitare che l'albero sia sottoposto a una coppia di torsione troppo
   elevata, si può ricorrere alla chiavetta di Woodruff, la quale se
   sottoposta a uno sforzo eccessivo si rompe e svincola l'albero motore dal
   carico.

Accorgimenti[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'albero motore può essere munito o caratterizzato da alcuni elementi o
   funzioni a seconda del tipo d'utilizzo:

     * Cavità nel caso di un albero motore dritto, questo può essere creato
       cavo per poter aumentare la sua leggerezza senza compromettere alla
       sua rigidezza nella torsione.
     * Contro rotante soluzione usata su alcuni mezzi stradali, in particolar
       modo sulle motociclette, in modo da ridurre l'effetto giroscopico e
       ridurre l'impennata, questo perché l'albero motore ruotando in senso
       opposto a quello delle ruote annulla parte dell'effetto giroscopico,
       permettendo un cambio di traiettoria più rapido (a discapito della
       stabilità) e dato che durante la rotazione del motore si genera una
       coppia contraria a quella del motore, questa coppia tende a
       contrastare quella della ruota in trazione, migliorando la stabilità.

a tema.

   Elegante, maestoso, rigoglioso: l’albero della vita è un simbolo
   ricorrente nella mitologia antica, un simbolo che ancora oggi affascina
   molte persone. Qual è però il significato dell’albero della vita? Oggi
   esistono numerosi oggetti che hanno questa forma o ne riportano
   l'incisione, ad esempio il ciondolo albero della vita, per questo vi sarà
   capitato di porvi diverse domande su questo albero e sul suo significato
   simbolico. Ciascuno di questi oggetti che ne riporta l'emblema, può essere
   utilizzato come idea regalo che celebra, in generale, un nuovo inizio:
   l’albero della vita può essere un originale profumatore per la casa, un
   portachiavi, un ciondolo, un orologio... Ogni oggetto che riporta la
   sagoma o le immagini di un albero della vita ha lo scopo di comunicare
   forza, sostegno e l'augurio che la vita possa essere sempre portatrice di
   nuovi inizi fortunati e stimolanti, oppure di incontri interessanti capaci
   di trasformarsi in legami duraturi ed importanti per la propria crescita
   personale. In questo articolo vogliamo spiegare approfonditamente il
   significato dell'Albero della Vita, per aiutare chi vuole fare un regalo
   originale ed è interessato a questo affascinante albero simbolico!

  Significato albero della vita

   Presente in diverse culture con nomi diversi, l’albero della vita viene
   generalmente considerato come sorgente di vita, luogo da cui ha origine
   ogni essere vivente. La vita viene rappresentata dai 4 elementi che
   compongono l’albero e ognuno di questi rappresenta un aspetto della vita
   stessa.

     * Radici, per essere ben salde devono andare in profondità.
     * Tronco, solido e resistente, sostengo dei numerosi rami.
     * Foglie, numerose.
     * Frutti, abbondanti solo in un periodo dell’anno, per questo preziosi.

   Unendo questi elementi si può interpretare l’albero della vita come una
   sorta di augurio per una vita costruita su solide radici, che
   rappresentano la famiglia e le relazioni. Una vita che si augura sia
   anche piena e ricca, come le numerose foglie, ed intensa, cercando di
   cogliere il momento, di non lasciarsi sfuggire le occasioni, proprio come
   i frutti maturi.

   All’albero della vita vengono affiancati anche 4 elementi: aria, acqua,
   terra, fuoco. Questi elementi sostengono l’albero e lo mantengono in
   contatto con il resto del mondo: l’acqua e il sole (fuoco) lo aiutano a
   crescere, la terra lo alimenta, l’aria lo rende parte della natura.   

  L’albero della vita nelle diverse culture

   L’albero della vita è presente in tantissime culture, antiche e non, oltre
   che in moltissimi miti e credenze ancora attuali. È un elemento
   ricorrente, il cui significato cambia leggermente, ma rimane comunque
   l’inizio della vita. Un inizio che può essere metaforico o letterale.

   Nella Bibbia era presente come simbolo di una vita esente da
   preoccupazioni, in opposizione all’albero della conoscenza. Nella
   mitologia egizia il primo uomo e la prima donna emersero da un albero; nel
   caso dell'albero della vita egiziano il significato racchiude sia la vita
   che la morte. Nella mitologia cinese è presente un albero che produce
   frutti preziosi, che rendono chi li mangia immortale: il frutto nasce però
   una volta ogni 300 anni.

   Dell'albero della vita vengono sempre evidenziati la forza della vita
   generatrice (ecco che ritorna il tema albero della vita famiglia), che fa
   nascere rami, foglie, frutti, oltre  alla ricchezza del frutto generato,
   simbolo di abbondanza, che porta benefici in diversi modi

  A chi regalare l’albero della vita?

   L’albero della vita è simbolo di nascita e rinascita. È un augurio per chi
   sta per iniziare una nuova vita: si augura che sia una vita basata su
   solide radici e che sia intensa. È un’idea regalo che si può fare a un
   bambino piccolo, come portafortuna. Inoltre, lo si può regalare a chiunque
   stia per iniziare una nuova fase della propria vita: una coppia, un
   giovane, qualcuno che inizia un nuovo lavoro. Ricominciare sì, ma senza
   dimenticare il passato e le proprie radici. È sicuramente un’idea
   originale usare l’albero della vita anche come bomboniera.

  Bomboniere Albero della Vita, perfette per ogni evento importante

   Le bomboniere a forma di Albero della Vita rappresentano un simbolo
   universale di crescita, connessione e prosperità. Questi piccoli oggetti
   decorativi si adattano perfettamente a una vasta gamma di eventi speciali,

   a eventi religiosi come battesimi e comunioni. L'albero della vita
   simboleggia la radice di una famiglia e la sua crescita nel tempo,
   rendendo le bomboniere con questa forma un omaggio significativo per
   celebrare e condividere momenti importanti nella vita delle persone.
   Possono essere personalizzate in vari modi, aggiungendo dettagli come i
   nomi degli sposi o dei neonati, e possono essere realizzate con una
   varietà di materiali e stili per adattarsi al tema dell'evento. In questo
   modo, le bomboniere Albero della Vita diventano dei doni simbolici che

   simbologia legata a questi elementi: in una fotografia troviamo infatti le
   radici che ci riconducono ad un determinato ricordo, qualcosa che ci tiene
   legati ad una persona o ad un avvenimento importante; il tronco
   rappresenta la forza che quel determinato momento, racchiuso in uno scatto
   fotografico, è riuscito a trasmetterci; le foglie sono invece il futuro,
   l'auspicio che la vita possa riservarci tanti altri momenti spensierati,
   traguardi importanti o persone di estremo valore per la nostra crescita.

   Qual è il significato dell’albero della vita?
   Curiosità religiose

                 Qual è il significato dell’albero della vita?

   Scritto da Myriam il 20 Maggio 2022 7 min di lettura

   L’albero della vita è un simbolo conosciuto in numerose culture, ognuna
   delle quali lo chiama in modi diversi e gli attribuisce significati
   mistici e magici. Fin dall’origina dell’uomo, le religioni sono legate per
   qualche ragione agli alberi.

   Nelle Sacre Scritture possiamo trovare numerosi riferimenti alle piante e
   agli alberi e così nel tempo hanno assunto un significato religioso
   profondo. Pensa ad esempio al seme di grano, legato alla parola di Cristo
   e al suo sacrificio, Lui che proprio come un seme è morto nella terra per
   rinascere e dare nuovi frutti. Oppure l’ulivo, simbolo di Gesù e
   dell’alleanza voluta da Dio con gli uomini e sancita con la sua morte
   sulla croce.

   In questo articolo vogliamo scoprire insieme a te il vero significato
   dell’albero della vita per la religione cristiana. Continua a leggere!

   Indice degli argomenti:

     * L’origine dell’albero della vita
          * Cosa significa l’albero della vita?
          * L’albero della vita nelle culture
          * I riferimenti biblici sull’albero della vita
     * Quando e a chi regalare un albero della vita?

L’origine dell’albero della vita

   Un altro albero che richiama un significato religioso profondo è l’abete.
   Ogni anno in occasione del Natale l’albero sempreverde si trasforma nel
   simbolo della Resurrezione di Cristo e della rinascita. Lo stesso albero
   compare anche in civiltà precedenti, come i celti e i greci, ed era
   associato al concetto di speranza, di fertilità e di nuova vita.

   Per comprendere il significato dell’albero della vita è necessario fare un
   discorso diverso. Nei testi sacri viene citato di frequente, dalla Genesi
   all’Apocalisse, e compare spesso anche nella cultura ebraica e in quella
   cristiana, arricchendosi nel corso del tempo di significati sempre più
   profondi e spirituali.

   La sua origine deriva da un albero che Dio aveva fatto nascere in mezzo al
   giardino dell’Eden, accanto all’albero della conoscenza del bene e del
   male. Adamo ed Eva poterono cibarsi dei frutti dell’albero della vita e
   per tutto quel tempo erano entrambi immortali. Intoccabili dallo scorrere
   del tempo, delle malattie e dalla vecchiaia. Come ci insegnano i testi
   sacri, peccando d’orgoglio e di arroganza, i due scelsero di mangiare
   anche i frutti dell’altro albero, quello della conoscenza del bene e del
   male, nonostante Dio gli avesse intimato di non farlo. Con questo gesto
   ignobile condannarono tutti gli uomini a vivere la propria vita conoscendo
   nel peccato e nel dolore.

   Sappiamo che l’albero della vita ha un ruolo molto simile in tutte le
   culture in cui è presente, ed è considerato come una sorgente di vita. La
   sua figura è composta da pochi e semplici elementi con significati
   profondi: le radici, il tronco, le foglie e i frutti. Ogni elemento
   rappresenta un aspetto importante della vita dell’uomo.

   Visto il suo significato profondo, l’albero della vita viene usato anche
   come idea regalo poiché simboleggia l’augurio e il portafortuna di una
   vita costruita su solide basi (tronco e radici) e che sia piena ed intensa
   (rami, foglie e frutti).

   I principali simboli dell’albero della vita sono: l’aria, l’acqua, la
   terra e il fuoco. I suoi poteri sono: la cura, la guarigione, il
   ringiovanimento, l’immortalità e il sostentamento.

   Quadretto Albero Della VitaQuadretto Albero Della Vita

  Cosa significa l’albero della vita?

   L’albero della vita viene considerato la sorgente di vita dunque, un luogo
   da cui ha origine ogni essere vivente. La vita viene rappresentata da 3
   elementi che vanno a comporre l’albero, ognuno di questi rappresenta un
   aspetto della vita stessa.

   Le radici, devono essere ben salde devono andare in profondità. Il tronco,
   solido e resistente, per sostenere i numerosi rami. Le foglie, numerose e
   rigogliose. I frutti, abbondanti solo in particolare periodo dell’anno e
   per questo preziosi.

   Se si uniscono questi elementi si può attribuire all’albero della vita un
   significato di buon auspicio, una sorta di augurio per una vita costruita
   su solide radici, che rappresentano la famiglia e le relazioni. Una vita
   piena e ricca, come le numerose foglie, ed intensa, cercando di cogliere
   il momento per non perdere occasioni importanti, proprio come i frutti
   maturi.

   Allo stesso modo, anche i quattro elementi associati all’albero, oltre a
   sostenerlo, lo collegano con il resto del mondo: l’acqua e il sole lo
   aiutano a crescere, la terra lo alimenta, l’aria lo rende parte della
   natura.

  L’albero della vita nelle culture

   Come abbiamo detto, l’albero della vita è presente in molte altre culture
   e in numerosi miti e credenze ancora attuali. Si tratta di un elemento
   ricorrente, che cambia sensibilmente, seppur rimane connesso con l’inizio
   della vita. Un inizio inteso sia in modo metaforico che letterale.

   Nella Bibbia ad esempio, era presente come simbolo di una vita esente da
   preoccupazioni, in contrapposizione all’albero della conoscenza, con i
   frutti del peccato. Nella mitologia egizia invece, da un albero nacquero
   il primo uomo e la prima donna. Nella mitologia cinese è presente un
   albero che produce frutti preziosi, che rendono immortale chi li mangia:
   il suo frutto nasce però una volta ogni 300 anni.

  I riferimenti biblici sull’albero della vita

   Nella Bibbia troviamo numerosi riferimenti che ci aiutano a comprendere il
   significato dell’albero della vita.

   “Ecco, l’uomo è diventato come uno di noi, quanto alla conoscenza del bene
   e del male. Guardiamo che egli non stenda la mano e prenda anche del
   frutto dell’albero della vita, ne mangi e viva per sempre.” (Genesi, 3:22)

   Dopo questo evento l’uomo viene bandito dal Paradiso terrestre e
   allontanato dai doni inestimabili dell’albero della vita. La conoscenza,
   la percezione di sé, dei propri desideri, e dei desideri altrui, fu
   l’inizio della fine. Solo con la purezza d’animo si poteva godere dei
   frutti dell’immortalità. Vergogna, ricatto, invidia e guerra nascono da
   questa conoscenza rubata, che l’uomo non sa gestire, e che lo porterà a
   suscitare l’idra di Dio al punto da scatenare il Diluvio Universale.

   Magnete Albero Della VitaMagnete Albero Della Vita

   Nonostante il peccato commesso dell’uomo, l’albero della vita non scompare
   dai testi sacri. Dio è infinitamente buono e lungimirante, per questo
   lascia sempre uno spiraglio di luce per i suoi figli. Un giorno infatti
   gli uomini meritevoli, che saranno stati in grado di ascoltare la Parola
   di Dio e di vivere secondo i suoi dettami, potranno gioire dei frutti
   dell’albero della vita: “Chi ha orecchi ascolti ciò che lo Spirito dice
   alle chiese. A chi vince io darò da mangiare dell’albero della vita, che è
   nel paradiso di Dio.” (Apocalisse, 2:7)

   Nella nuova Gerusalemme infatti, la città degli eletti che saranno
   risvegliati da Cristo per vivere una nuova vita nella pace e nello
   splendore in terra, ritroveremo l’albero della vita: “In mezzo alla piazza
   della città e sulle due rive del fiume stava l’albero della vita. Esso dà
   dodici raccolti all’anno, porta il suo frutto ogni mese e le foglie
   dell’albero sono per la guarigione delle nazioni.” (Apocalisse, 22:2)

   La promessa che si nasconde dietro al simbolo dell’albero della vita va
   ben oltre. Perché il fiume che scorre nel nuovo Paradiso in terra è la
   Parola di Dio, come possiamo leggere in molte citazioni nei testi sacri, e
   in essa possiamo vivere ogni giorno del suo nutrimento come se fossimo noi
   stessi alberi: “Beato l’uomo che non cammina secondo il consiglio degli
   empi, che non si ferma nella via dei peccatori; né si siede in compagnia
   degli schernitori; ma il cui diletto è nella legge del Signore, e su
   quella legge medita giorno e notte. Egli sarà come un albero piantato
   vicino a ruscelli, il quale dà il suo frutto a suo tempo, e il cui
   fogliame non appassisce; e tutto quello che fa, prospererà.” (Salmi,
   1:1-3)

   La similitudine tra chi crede e vive seguendo la volontà del Signore, e
   gli alberi ricchi di frutto che crescono lungo le rive del fiume, si
   presenta spesso anche in altri passaggi dei testi sacri, così come nelle
   parole di profeti e saggi.

Quando e a chi regalare un albero della vita?

   Come abbiamo detto, l’albero della vita è simbolo di nascita e rinascita,
   e rappresenta un augurio importante per chi sta iniziando una nuova vita.
   È un’idea regalo perfetta per un bambino piccolo che festeggia il suo
   Battesimo. Ma in generale si può regalare a chiunque stia per iniziare una
   nuova fase della propria vita: una coppia, un giovane oppure qualcuno che
   inizia un nuovo lavoro. L’albero della vita può anche essere un’idea per
   una bomboniera da consegnare ai propri cari in occasione di festeggiamenti
   importanti.

   Stai cercando un regalo speciale per una persona che sta per iniziare una
   fase importante della sua vita? Oppure sei alla ricerca di una bomboniera
   preziosa e ricca di significato? Nel nostro sito puoi trovare la soluzione
   giusta per te. Scopri la sezione dedicata all’albero della vita!

   11- Perché offrire un albero della vita?

   Sebbene il simbolo dell'albero della vita o dell'albero della vita sia
   molto antico, si nota che viene rappresentato più frequentemente nella
   nostra vita quotidiana. Sotto forma di gioielli, tatuaggi o
   rappresentazioni iconografiche, il simbolo dell'albero della vita compare
   sempre più spesso nelle nostre società. Il ritorno di questo simbolo può
   essere legato alle preoccupazioni ambientali che invadono sempre più la
   nostra vita quotidiana. Tuttavia, il successo di questa rappresentazione è
   dovuto anche al fatto che l'albero è sempre stato e rimane una delle
   realizzazioni della natura più impressionanti per le nostre menti umane
   alla ricerca di un significato.

   In questo articolo parleremo di questo antico simbolo, del ruolo speciale
   che ha avuto nell'iconografia medievale e del significato che gli
   attribuiamo oggi.

L'albero della vita: un simbolo antico

   Sia nelle rappresentazioni di numerose civiltà che nella Bibbia, l'albero
   della vita è un archetipo che si ritrova fin dalle civiltà preistoriche.

  L'albero della vita nella Bibbia

   Nella Genesi, l'albero della vita appare nel Giardino dell'Eden. Si trova
   accanto all'albero della conoscenza del bene e del male. L'albero della
   vita è un dono di Dio: è associato all'amore e alla protezione di Dio.
   Darà cibo e riparo ad Adamo ed Eva.

   Quando il primo uomo e la prima donna scelsero di assaggiare il frutto
   dell'albero della conoscenza, il Signore cacciò Adamo ed Eva dal Giardino
   dell'Eden per proteggere l'albero della vita. Questo albero avrebbe dato
   loro la vita eterna. Questo è impossibile ora che gli uomini conoscono il
   male.

   L'albero della vita si trova anche negli scritti dell'Apocalisse: in
   questi testi, l'albero è descritto come un albero dell'abbondanza, una
   ricompensa finale presente nel paradiso di Dio.

  Il caso speciale dell'albero di Jesse

   L'albero di Jesse è ben distinto dall'albero della vita, ma
   iconograficamente la sua rappresentazione è quella dell'albero della vita.

   Nei Vangeli di Matteo e Luca troviamo una lunga genealogia di Cristo che
   si estende per diverse decine di generazioni. La rappresentazione di
   questa filiazione prese naturalmente la forma di un albero. L'albero di
   Jesse si trova quindi in molte rappresentazioni cristiane.

  L'albero della vita nelle culture del mondo

   Non sorprende che l'albero della vita non sia solo un simbolo cristiano.

   Questo essere affascinante, vivente e apparentemente immutabile è il
   legame tra cielo e terra. Domina l'uomo da tutta la sua altezza, lo nutre
   e lo protegge e gli ha sempre permesso di costruire gli strumenti
   necessari alla sua sopravvivenza.

   Nelle rappresentazioni delle civiltà assira, egizia, maya o celtica,
   l'albero della vita è, a seconda delle culture, il pilastro del mondo,
   l'asse centrale che unisce il cielo e la terra o l'albero del mondo. Dalle
   radici alle punte delle foglie più alte, l'albero per sua natura parla
   all'uomo, sempre alla ricerca di significati e simboli.

   L'albero del mondo egizio è il pilastro del mondo e sostiene con i suoi
   rami la volta celeste.

   Anche i Maya, una cultura precolombiana, rappresentavano l'albero del
   mondo che collegava il cielo, la terra e il mondo sotterraneo. Secondo i
   Maya, questo albero iniziò a crescere al momento della creazione del
   mondo. Il mondo emergeva dall'albero in quattro direzioni: nord, sud, est
   e ovest. Nell'albero della vita maya, al centro si trova una croce che
   rappresenta la fonte di tutta la creazione.

   Nella Cabala della religione ebraica, l'albero della vita è associato a un
   simbolismo molto forte e complesso.

   Tra i Celti si parla di albero del mondo, per loro ogni albero è
   l'antenato di un essere umano. È la rappresentazione più potente delle
   forze della natura e dell'armonia che le unisce.

L'albero della vita nel Medioevo

  Il simbolismo in epoca romanica: un supporto ideale per la rappresentazione
  dell'albero della vita

   Chi non ha mai guardato il timpano di una chiesa romanica o una miniatura
   medievale da una pergamena? Tutti i dettagli misteriosi rappresentati dai
   miniatori dell'epoca e dagli scultori sono talvolta un vero e proprio
   oggetto di fascino.

   Ispirato in gran parte dai benedettini, il simbolismo nel Medioevo (e
   ancor più nel periodo romanico) aveva lo scopo di comunicare con il popolo
   analfabeta. Ancora oggi, lo strano bestiario di questi animali scolpiti
   nella pietra è fonte di meraviglia. Queste chimere e questi strani
   personaggi erano sempre accompagnati da una decorazione vegetale.

   È in questo contesto che osserviamo nelle nostre chiese sempre più
   rappresentazioni dell'albero della croce della vita.

  Il legno della croce

   Il legno della croce utilizzato dai Romani per le crocifissioni era un
   legno disprezzato. Non si trattava di una specie nobile, ma di una specie
   comune, solitamente il pino. Non era un albero che portava frutti, era un
   legno di morte, poiché gli uomini vi erano legati per morire. Il legno
   delle crocifissioni era un legno sterile invece di un legno vivificante.
   La risurrezione rende nobile il legno della croce.

  Il concetto di albero trasversale della vita

   Quando Adamo ed Eva assaggiarono il frutto dell'albero della conoscenza
   del bene e del male, l'albero della vita fu loro proibito. Questo spiega
   il disordine dell'umanità. La croce della crocifissione, con il suo legno,
   con la sua verticalità, ristabilisce il legame tra la terra e il cielo,
   tra gli uomini e Dio. Questa idea si riflette nella rappresentazione della
   croce-albero della vita che si trova spesso nelle chiese romaniche tra
   l'XI e il XIII secolo.

   esempio di illustrazione da aggiungere

   La Santa Croce di Gesù è il nuovo albero della vita che unisce cielo e
   terra. Per questo motivo, nel Medioevo, esistevano molte rappresentazioni
   di questa croce di Cristo vegetalizzata e adornata con ogni sorta di
   aggiunte vegetali.

   Questa nuova rappresentazione ci invita finalmente a essere noi stessi
   alberi fruttiferi, trasmettitori di una vita ricca e nutriente per noi e
   per la nostra comunità.

   In seguito, dal XIII secolo fino al XX secolo, torneremo a immagini molto
   più rappresentative della crocifissione di Gesù. Il passaggio dalla
   croce-albero della vita al crocifisso che mostra Gesù nel dolore, nella
   sofferenza, nel rifiuto dei peccati dell'umanità, ha la precedenza sulla
   croce come simbolo della vita e dei legami tra l'uomo e Dio.

Il ritorno del simbolo dell'albero della vita

  L'albero come simbolo nella nostra vita

   Nel nostro tempo, l'albero della vita ha riacquistato il suo significato:
   quello di simbolo di rinascita, di partenza o di nuovo inizio, di apertura
   a una nuova vita.

   Consideriamo semplicemente l'albero di Natale che ci accompagna ogni anno.
   Per le civiltà più antiche, come i Celti o i Greci, era associato alla
   speranza, alla nuova vita e alla fertilità. Il simbolo dell'albero di
   Natale il 24 dicembre, solstizio d'inverno, assume il suo pieno
   significato con la speranza di una rinascita nel nuovo anno.

   Infine, oggi non possiamo rimanere insensibili a tutte le questioni
   ambientali che preoccupano la nostra società, che ci preoccupano. Una
   delle soluzioni proposte dagli scienziati per combattere il riscaldamento
   globale è quella di piantare più alberi per purificare l'aria del nostro
   pianeta.

  Perché dare un albero della vita?

   Come abbiamo visto, l'albero della vita trascende il tempo. Ha sempre
   avuto un valore simbolico e universale. È una fonte di elevazione e di
   crescita sia a livello spirituale che fisico. Simboleggia protezione,
   rinascita e vita eterna.

   Proprio per questo motivo, un albero della vita sotto forma di gioiello o
   di rappresentazione è il regalo ideale per un battesimo, una comunione,
   una professione di fede o qualsiasi momento simbolico nella vita di una
   persona cara.

     * *  *  *  * L’albero della vita riguarda qualunque essere umano ed è un
simbolo riconosciuto dalle principali culture e religioni del pianeta, anche se
viene chiamato in modi diversi e gli si attribuiscono vari significati mistici o
magici. Vediamo insieme quali sono.

   L’albero della vita: simbolo di esistenza solida, prosperosa e intensa

   Nelle sacre scritture si trovano numerosi riferimenti alle piante e agli
   alberi. Il famoso seme di grano di cui parla Cristo, ad esempio, o anche
   Lui stesso che come un seme muore sulla Terra (e nella terra) per
   rinascere e portare nuovi frutti.

   Oppure l’ulivo, così importante per la Toscana, simbolo sempre di Gesù e
   dell’alleanza di Dio con gli uomini. Un altro albero dal significato
   mistico è l’abete, il sempreverde che per Natale si trasforma nel simbolo
   della nascita di Cristo.

   Ma lo stesso albero emerge anche in civiltà precedenti, come i celti e i
   greci, associato al concetto di speranza, di fertilità e nuova vita.

   L'abete è uno degli alberi simbolo della nascita e della rinascita.

  L’albero della vita nella Bibbia

   Nella Bibbia, l’albero della vita viene citato di frequente, dalla Genesi
   all’Apocalisse, e compare spesso anche nella cultura ebraica e in quella
   cristiana, arricchendosi nel corso del tempo di significati sempre più
   profondi e spirituali.

   La sua origine mitica deriva da un albero che Dio fa crescere nel giardino
   dell’Eden, accanto all’albero della conoscenza del bene e del male. Adamo
   ed Eva, potendo cibarsi dei frutti dell’albero della vita, rimangono per
   questo immortali, inattaccabili dal tempo, dalle malattie e dalla
   vecchiaia.

   Come sappiamo, tuttavia, nonostante la proibizione divina, peccando
   d’orgoglio e arroganza, i due scelgono di mangiare anche i frutti
   dell’altro albero, quello della conoscenza del bene e del male,
   condannando, secondo il mito, tutti gli uomini a vivere la propria vita
   nel peccato e nel dolore.

   Basilica della Santissima Annunziata a Firenze

  Un albero del Paradiso Terrestre

   Nonostante il peccato commesso dall’uomo, la perdita di purezza, e il suo
   allontanamento dal Paradiso Terrestre, l’albero della vita non scompare
   dai testi sacri: “Chi ha orecchi ascolti ciò che lo Spirito dice alle
   chiese. A chi vince io darò da mangiare dell’albero della vita, che è nel
   paradiso di Dio.” (Apocalisse, 2:7)

   Nella nuova Gerusalemme, la città degli eletti che saranno risvegliati da
   Cristo per vivere una nuova vita nella pace e nello splendore in terra,
   ritroviamo l’albero della vita: “In mezzo alla piazza della città e sulle
   due rive del fiume stava l’albero della vita. Esso dà dodici raccolti
   all’anno, porta il suo frutto ogni mese e le foglie dell’albero sono per
   la guarigione delle nazioni.” (Apocalisse, 22:2).

   Nella tradizione cristiana l’albero rappresenta simbolicamente la Croce di
   Cristo. Ancora oggi nella liturgia dell’Esaltazione della Santa Croce, nel
   prefazio si dice: «Nell’albero della Croce tu hai stabilito la salvezza
   dell’uomo, perché donde sorgeva la morte di là risorgesse la vita, e chi
   dell’albero traeva vittoria, dall’albero venisse sconfitto, per Cristo
   nostro Signore.»

   cristiana?

   L'albero della vita è simbolo di rinascita e vita eterna

  L’albero della vita simbolo di sorgente di vita

   L’albero della vita ha un ruolo molto simile in tutte le culture in cui
   appare, ed è considerato principalmente come una sorgente di vita. La sua
   figura è composta da pochi e semplici elementi con significati profondi:
   le radici, il tronco, le foglie e i frutti. Ogni elemento rappresenta un
   aspetto importante della vita dell’uomo.

   Le radici, devono essere ben salde e andare in profondità. Il tronco, deve
   essere solido e resistente per sostenere i numerosi rami. Le foglie,
   numerose e rigogliose. I frutti, abbondanti solo in un particolare periodo
   dell’anno e per questo preziosi.

   Unendo poi questi elementi si attribuisce all’albero della vita un
   significato di buon auspicio, una sorta di augurio per una vita costruita
   su solide radici, che rappresentano la famiglia e le relazioni, una vita
   piena, ricca e intensa, come le numerose foglie, una vita che cerca di
   cogliere il momento (carpe diem) per non perdere occasioni importanti,
   proprio come i frutti maturi.

   Le radici dell'albero sono simbolo di vita.

  L’albero nelle grandi culture dell’antichità

   I principali simboli associati all’albero della vita sono gli elementi
   primari, come l’aria, l’acqua, la terra e il fuoco: l’acqua e il sole lo
   aiutano a crescere, la terra lo alimenta, l’aria lo rende parte della
   natura. I suoi poteri sono: la cura, la guarigione, il ringiovanimento,
   l’immortalità e il sostentamento.

   L’albero della vita è elemento ricorrente di altre grandi culture
   dell’antichità, oltre a quella ebraica e cristiana. Se nella Bibbia
   rappresenta una vita felice, in contrapposizione all’albero della
   conoscenza che porta i frutti del peccato, nella mitologia egizia da un
   albero nascono il primo uomo e la prima donna. Nella mitologia cinese c’è
   invece un albero che produce frutti preziosi, i quali rendono immortale
   chi li mangia: il suo frutto nasce però una volta ogni 300 anni.

  Un simbolo di nascita e di rinascita

   Essendo l’albero simbolo di nascita e di rinascita, rappresenta un augurio
   importante per chi sta iniziando una nuova vita. Può essere un’idea regalo
   per festeggiare la nascita di un bambino, ma in generale si può donare a
   chiunque stia per iniziare una nuova fase della propria esistenza: una
   coppia, un giovane, oppure qualcuno che comincia un nuovo lavoro, perché
   l’albero è l’auspicio di una vita costruita su solide basi (tronco e
   radici), oltre che piena, intensa e soddisfacente (rami, foglie e frutti).

   L’Albero della Vita esiste davvero?

    L’albero della vita è citato nelle Sacre Scritture, dalla Genesi
    all’Apocalisse, come simbolo della vita per eccellenza. Ma esiste veramente
    un albero così speciale?

   Da sempre gli uomini attribuiscono a determinati alberi un valore
   simbolico e religioso. Basti pensare a tutte le religioni che li hanno
   messi al centro del proprio pantheon.

   Comprendere le ragioni di questo legame profondo tra uomo a alberi non è
   facile. Forse nasce dal fatto che, fin dalle epoche più remote, gli uomini
   cercavano negli alberi riparo e protezione, finendo con il rivestirli del
   ruolo di giganti protettori, saggi, amici. Sicuramente la forma stessa
   dell’albero, il suo sviluppo verticale ha contribuito all’approfondirsi di
   questo legame spirituale. L’albero unisce il cielo alla terra, il mondo
   degli dei a quello degli uomini, e nel farlo si fa divinità esso stesso, e
   come tale portatore delle risposte a tutte le domande, a tutte le
   contraddizioni che dominano la vita degli uomini da sempre: il Bene e il
   Male, la Vita e la Morte, la Conoscenza, la Trasmutazione, l’Umano e il
   Divino.

   Molte religioni arcaiche parlano di un asse cosmico intorno al quale si
   sarebbe formato l’intero universo, e che unisce attraversandoli cielo,
   terra e mondo sotterraneo. Un asse che spesso ha la forma di un albero.

   Comunque la vogliamo interpretare, la mitologia legata agli alberi, in
   generale, e all’albero della vita in particolare è affascinante a affonda
   le sue radici – è il caso di dirlo… – nelle origini stesse della storia
   umana.

   In un articolo precedente ci siamo soffermati sul significato dell’albero
   della vita in ambito cristiano. Abbiamo esaminato come esso sia citato nei
   testi sacri, e come la sua simbologia ricorra nella cultura ebraica e
   successivamente in quella cristiana. Secondo la Bibbia esso sorgeva in
   mezzo al giardino dell’Eden, accanto all’albero della conoscenza del bene
   e del male.

   Il significato dell’albero della vita
   Tutte le religioni, dalle origini della storia dell’uomo, sono legate in
   qualche modo agli alberi…

   Era grazie ai suoi frutti che Adamo ed Eva erano immortali, immuni allo
   scorrere del tempo, alla vecchiaia e alle malattie. Con il peccato
   originale Adamo ed Eva perdono il diritto di nutrirsi dei frutti di questo
   albero miracoloso. Anche in questa parte della storia risiede una
   simbologia profonda: mangiando i frutti dell’albero della conoscenza del
   bene e del male, il primo uomo e la prima donna hanno perso il diritto a
   godere i benefici dell’albero della vita. Il loro peccato è stato
   dettato dall’orgoglio e dall’arroganza. La conoscenza del bene e del male
   fece loro perdere l’innocenza, li rese coscienti di tutti quei sentimenti
   e desideri che prima non provavano, per il semplice fatto che nel Paradiso
   Terrestre avevano tutto ciò di cui necessitavano per essere felici,
   completi. L’uomo non era pronto per far fronte a quei sentimenti, a quelle
   emozioni, a quei bisogni: odio, menzogna, vergogna, invidia, ricatto,
   guerra.

   La storia di Adamo ed Eva
   Chi non conosce la storia di Adamo ed Eva, il primo uomo e la prima donna?

   Tuttavia, nonostante la cacciata dal Paradiso terrestre, l’albero della
   vita rimane nei testi sacri come promessa di salvezza e speranza di
   riconciliazione con Dio, che seguita a promettere i suoi frutti in premio
   a chi saprà seguire la retta via. L’avvento di Cristo, il nuovo Adamo, il
   Figlio che, anziché sfidare per orgoglio la volontà del Padre, si
   sottomette ad essa fino alle estreme conseguenze, rappresenta un punto di
   svolta fondamentale per la storia spirituale dell’uomo. Ed ecco che
   la Croce su cui Gesù muore per la salvezza di tutti diviene il nuovo
   albero della vita, simbolo di una salvezza promessa a tutti coloro i quali
   sapranno seguire l’esempio di Cristo.

   La simbologia dell’albero rimane una costante per i credenti, e ancora
   oggi è molto diffusa. La filosofia New age l’ha rilanciata, recuperando
   soprattutto aspetti folklorici e mitologici, ma l’essenza della tradizione
   cristiana continua a renderlo in simbolo molto caro e utilizzato. Per
   esempio, la bomboniera albero della vita è molto apprezzata e utilizzata
   soprattutto per la prima comunione e il battesimo, mentre indossare un
   gioiello che raffigura questo particolare simbolo, come una collana albero
   della vita o un bracciale albero della vita, è un modo per manifestare la
   propria fede verso questo albero mistico, e tutto ciò che
   rappresenta. Regalare un gioiello che lo raffigura è un augurio sentito
   per una vita prospera e felice, con radici solide, rigogliosa come il
   fogliame, intensa e ricca di buoni frutti. Per le donne diventa anche un
   simbolo di fecondità. Donato a un bambino appena nato è un modo per
   celebrare una nuova vita che ha inizio.

Il ‘vero’ albero della vita

   Ma esiste davvero un albero della vita, da qualche parte nel mondo? In
   mezzo al deserto del Bahrain, poco lontano dal Djebel Dukhan (la Montagna
   del Fumo) e a 40 km da Manama, sorge un albero antico. Sembra sia qui da
   più di quattrocento anni, cresciuto in una terra brulla, desertica, priva
   di vegetazione.

   albero della vita
                               Albero della Vita

   E tuttavia esso vive e prospera, e ha superato i dieci metri di altezza,
   tanto da meritare la fama di albero leggendario e aver reso l’oasi in cui
   sorge uno dei luoghi più mistici al mondo. Gli abitanti della regione gli
   hanno dato il nome di nome di Shajarat-al-Hayat, “albero della vita”, e
   credono che l’albero sia stato piantato qui nel 1583 per indicare il luogo
   in cui in origine si estendeva il Paradiso Terrestre. Un’affermazione
   ardita, considerando che al giorno d’oggi la zona è completamente
   desertica! Ma alcuni rilevamenti avrebbero dimostrato che, in epoche
   remote, questa regione fosse ricca d’acqua, e vi si estendesse un’immensa
   oasi rigogliosa e popolata da una moltitudine di animali di ogni tipo.
   L’albero in questione è una Prosopis cineraria, un arbusto in grado di
   sopravvivere in condizioni oltremodo ostili, grazie alle sue radici capaci
   di scendere fino a 50 metri di profondità. Questo gli permette di trarre
   il suo nutrimento anche dal terreno arido e brullo. Con la sua resina si
   producono gomma, candele e profumi. Viene visitato da più di 50.000
   turisti ogni anno, tanto che è stato necessario proteggerlo con un recinto
   di ferro per evitare che venisse danneggiato da qualche vandalo. Infatti
   molti visitatori avevano preso la brutta abitudine di strappare foglie e
   rametti per portarseli via come portafortuna o souvenir, o si divertivano
   a lasciare il proprio messaggio inciso nel suo tronco secolare. Per
   ora Shajarat-al-Hayat sembra godere di ottima salute, con ampi rami
   aggrovigliati, foglie cangianti che vanno dal verde al marrone in
   sfumature splendide e vivide, un tronco maestoso. È così da oltre
   quattrocento anni, e ci auguriamo che possa continuare a stare bene ancora
   molto a lungo.

   Da Wikipedia, l'enciclopedia libera.

   Un albero sintattico o concreto è un albero che rappresenta la struttura
   sintattica di una stringa in accordo a determinate forme grammaticali. Un
   programma che produce quest'albero viene chiamato parser. Gli alberi
   sintattici possono essere generati per frasi delle lingue naturali
   attraverso l'elaborazione del linguaggio naturale, così come durante
   l'elaborazione di linguaggi formali e di linguaggi di programmazione.

   La struttura ad albero è stata mutuata dalla teoria dei grafi per
   rappresentare l'idea intuitiva che le frasi delle lingue naturali possono
   essere segmentate in unità più piccole.^[1] È detto "indicatore
   sintagmatico" ogni rappresentazione (ad albero o per mezzo di parentesi)
   dei sintagmi di una frase.^[2]

Caratteristiche[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   [IMG]Un semplice albero sintattico della frase inglese «John ha colpito la
   palla».

   Un albero sintattico è composto da nodi e rami. La figura a fianco è un
   albero sintattico linguistico che permette di creare determinate frasi in
   lingua inglese. Nel disegno, l'albero sintattico è l'intera struttura che
   parte da S e termina in ognuna delle foglie (John, ball, the, hit).

   Nell'albero sono usate le seguenti abbreviazioni:

     * S sta per la frase, la struttura top-level in questo esempio;
     * NP sta per sintagma nominale. Il primo ramo (quello a sinistra) è il
       soggetto John. L'altro è l'oggetto della frase;
     * VP sta per sintagma verbale, che serve il predicato;
     * V per verbo. In questo caso, hit («ha colpito»);
     * Det sta per aggettivo determinativo, in questo caso the («la»);
     * N sta per sostantivo.

   Nell'albero sintattico, ogni nodo può essere un nodo radice, un nodo ramo
   o un nodo foglia. Nell'esempio precedente, S è il nodo radice, NP e VP
   sono nodi rami, mentre John, ball, the e hit sono tutti foglie.

   I nodi si possono anche riferire ai genitori e ai figli di nodi. Un
   genitore è quel nodo che ha almeno un altro nodo collegato con un ramo
   sotto di lui. Nell'esempio, S è genitore sia di NP che di VP. Un figlio è
   quel nodo che ha almeno un ramo collegato a un nodo sopra di lui;
   nell'esempio, hit è un figlio del nodo V.

           2.3 Alberi sintattittici                               Indietro Avanti 

     Un albero sintattico e' una rappresentazione di come una particolare
     frase puo` essere derivata da una grammatica, a partire dall' assioma.

     L' albero sintattico assegna alle frasi una struttura chwe puo` essere
     utilizzata per operaziomni successive quali l' interpretazione della
     frase, la sua traduzione etc.

     Anche i traduttori o compilatori analizzano il linguaggio sorgente,
     producono un albero sintattico del programma e lo utilizzano per
     tradurlo in linguaggio macchina.

      Dato un insieme di regole, esse possono essere       Grammatica 
      utilizzate per derivare o produrre una proposizione  
      applicando il metodo riportato qui di seguito.       
      Si parte dal simbolo non terminale proposizione, si  
      cerca una regola avente proposizione come parte      
      sinistra, e si sostituisce la sua parte destra al    
      posto di proposizione. In questo modo si rimpiazza   
      un simbolo non terminale con una delle stringhe di   
      cui puo` essere composto.                            
      Visualizziamo questa operazione utilizzando          
      opportuni diagrammi, detti alberi sintattici, che    
      permettono di descrivere la struttura di un regola   
      scomponendola nelle sue parti costituenti:           

      Si ripete il processo applicandolo ad uno dei simboli non       
      terminali, ad esempio sintagma_nominale.                        
      La derivazione e' completa quando la frontiera dell' albero (le 
      foglie) contiene solo simbolo terminali.                        
      Il simbolo non terminale proposizione viene chiamato radice     
      dell'albero, mentre i simboli terminali foglie Espandendo il    
      vocabolario dei simboli terminali, e` possibile descrivere un   
      numero maggiore di proposizioni.                                

                                   Quiz                                       

                                                               IndietroAvanti

                           Albero sintattico astratto

   Da Wikipedia, l'enciclopedia libera.
   Vai alla navigazione Vai alla ricerca

   In informatica, un albero sintattico astratto (AST) o semplicemente albero
   sintattico è una rappresentazione ad albero della struttura sintattica
   astratta del testo (spesso codice sorgente) scritto in un linguaggio
   formale. Ogni nodo dell'albero denota un costrutto che si verifica nel
   testo.

   La sintassi è "astratta" nel senso che non rappresenta ogni dettaglio
   presente nella sintassi reale, ma solo quelli strutturali o relativi al
   contenuto. Ad esempio, le parentesi di raggruppamento sono implicite nella
   struttura ad albero quindi non devono essere rappresentate da nodi
   separati. Similmente, un costrutto solitamente sintattico come
   l'istruzione se-condizione-allora può essere denotato per mezzo di un
   singolo nodo con tre rami.

   Questo distingue gli alberi sintattici astratti da quelli concreti,
   tradizionalmente designati come alberi di analisi che sono tipicamente
   costruiti da un parser durante la traduzione del codice sorgente e il
   processo di compilazione. Una volta costruiti, ulteriori informazioni
   vengono aggiunte all'AST mediante elaborazioni successive come le analisi
   contestuali.

   Gli alberi sintattici astratti vengono utilizzati anche nell'analisi del
   programma e nei sistemi di trasformazione del programma.

Applicazione nei compilatori[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Gli alberi sintattici astratti sono strutture dati ampiamente utilizzate
   dai compilatori per rappresentare la struttura del codice sorgente. Un AST
   è in genere il risultato della fase di analisi sintattica del compilatore.
   Spesso funge da rappresentazione intermedia del programma attraverso le
   diverse fasi di compilazione e ha un forte impatto sul risultato finale.

  Motivazioni[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Un AST ha diverse proprietà che aiutano nelle varie fasi del processo di
   compilazione:

     * Può essere modificato e migliorato con informazioni quali proprietà e
       annotazioni per ogni elemento che contiene, impossibile da fare con il
       codice sorgente di un programma, poiché implicherebbe cambiarlo.
     * Rispetto al codice sorgente, un AST non include punteggiatura e
       delimitatori non essenziali (parentesi, punto e virgola, ecc.).
     * Di solito contiene informazioni extra sul programma, a causa delle
       varie fasi di analisi da parte del compilatore. Ad esempio, può
       memorizzare la posizione di ciascun elemento nel codice sorgente,
       consentendo al compilatore di stampare utili messaggi di errore.

   Gli AST sono necessari a causa della natura intrinseca dei linguaggi di
   programmazione e della relativa documentazione. Le lingue sono spesso
   ambigue per natura. Per evitare questa ambiguità, i linguaggi di
   programmazione sono spesso specificati come grammatica libera dal contesto
   (CFG). Tuttavia, ci sono spesso aspetti dei linguaggi di programmazione
   che una CFG non può esprimere, ma fanno parte del linguaggio e sono
   documentati nelle sue specifiche. Questi sono dettagli che richiedono un
   contesto per determinarne la validità e il comportamento. Ad esempio, se
   un linguaggio consente la dichiarazione di nuovi tipi, una CFG non può
   prevedere i nomi di tali tipi né il modo in cui debbano essere utilizzati.
   Anche se un linguaggio ha un insieme predefinito di tipi, il modo corretto
   di utilizzarli di norma richiede un contesto. Un altro esempio è il duck
   typing, in cui il tipo di un elemento può cambiare a seconda del contesto.
   L'overloading degli operatori è un altro caso in cui l'utilizzo corretto e
   la funzione finale dipendono dal contesto.

  Design[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   La progettazione di un AST è spesso strettamente collegata alla
   progettazione di un compilatore e alle sue caratteristiche.

   I requisiti fondamentali includono quanto segue:

     * I tipi di variabile devono essere preservati, così come la posizione
       di ogni dichiarazione nel codice sorgente.
     * L'ordine delle istruzioni eseguibili deve essere rappresentato in modo
       esplicito e ben definito.
     * I componenti sinistro e destro delle operazioni binarie devono essere
       memorizzati e identificati correttamente.
     * Gli identificatori e i relativi valori devono essere memorizzati per
       le istruzioni di assegnazione.

   Questi requisiti possono essere usati per progettare la struttura dati per
   l'AST.

   Alcune operazioni richiedono sempre due elementi, come i due termini per
   l'addizione. Tuttavia, alcuni costrutti di linguaggio richiedono un numero
   arbitrariamente elevato di elementi figlio, come l'elenco di argomenti
   passati ai programmi dalla shell. Di conseguenza, un AST utilizzato per
   rappresentare il codice scritto in tale linguaggio deve anche essere
   sufficientemente flessibile da consentire l'aggiunta rapida di una
   quantità sconosciuta di figli.

   Per supportare la verifica del compilatore, dovrebbe essere possibile
   riconvertire l'AST in un codice sorgente sufficientemente simile
   all'originale nell'aspetto e identico nell'esecuzione dopo la
   ricompilazione.

  Utilizzo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   L'AST viene utilizzato intensamente durante l'analisi semantica, dove il
   compilatore verifica il corretto utilizzo degli elementi del programma e
   del linguaggio. Il compilatore genera anche la tabella dei simboli in base
   all'AST durante l'analisi semantica. Un attraversamento completo
   dell'albero permette di verificare la correttezza del programma.

   Dopo aver verificato la correttezza, l'AST funge da base per la
   generazione del codice la quale spesso avviene per mezzo di una
   rappresentazione intermedia (IR) talvolta detta linguaggio intermedio.

Albero sintattico

   Un albero sintattico o concreto è un albero che rappresenta la struttura
   sintattica di una stringa in accordo a determinate forme grammaticali. Un
   programma che produce quest'albero viene chiamato parser. Gli alberi
   sintattici possono essere generati per frasi delle lingue naturali
   attraverso l'elaborazione del linguaggio naturale, così come durante
   l'elaborazione di linguaggi formali e di linguaggi di programmazione.

   La struttura ad albero è stata mutuata dalla teoria dei grafi per
   rappresentare l'idea intuitiva che le frasi delle lingue naturali possono
   essere segmentate in unità più piccole. È detto "indicatore sintagmatico"
   ogni rappresentazione (ad albero o per mezzo di parentesi) dei sintagmi di
   una frase.

Caratteristiche modifica

   Un semplice albero sintattico della frase inglese «John ha colpito la
   palla».

   Un albero sintattico è composto da nodi e rami. La figura a fianco è un
   albero sintattico linguistico che permette di creare determinate frasi in
   lingua inglese. Nel disegno, l'albero sintattico è l'intera struttura che
   parte da S e termina in ognuna delle foglie (John, ball, the, hit).

   Nell'albero sono usate le seguenti abbreviazioni:

     * S sta per la frase, la struttura top-level in questo esempio;
     * NP sta per sintagma nominale. Il primo ramo (quello a sinistra) è il
       soggetto John. L'altro è l'oggetto della frase;
     * VP sta per sintagma verbale, che serve il predicato;
     * V per verbo. In questo caso, hit («ha colpito»);
     * Det sta per aggettivo determinativo, in questo caso the («la»);
     * N sta per sostantivo.

   Nell'albero sintattico, ogni nodo può essere un nodo radice, un nodo ramo
   o un nodo foglia. Nell'esempio precedente, S è il nodo radice, NP e VP
   sono nodi rami, mentre John, ball, the e hit sono tutti foglie.

   I nodi si possono anche riferire ai genitori e ai figli di nodi. Un
   genitore è quel nodo che ha almeno un altro nodo collegato con un ramo
   sotto di lui. Nell'esempio, S è genitore sia di NP che di VP. Un figlio è
   quel nodo che ha almeno un ramo collegato a un nodo sopra di lui;
   nell'esempio, hit è un figlio del nodo V.

     * Convenzioni sulle parentesi

                                  Proposizioni

   Sintassi Fissiamo un insieme \(L\) non vuoto i cui elementi si dicono
   lettere proposizionali. Le lettere proposizionali sono indicate dalle
   prime lettere dell’alfabeto \(\mathrm{A} , \mathrm{B} , \mathrm{C} ,
   \dots\) (eventualmente con pedici e apici, come \(\mathrm{A}_{0},
   \mathrm{A}_{1}, \dotsc\) o \(\mathrm{A}' , \mathrm{A}'', \dotsc\)).
   L’insieme \(Prop ( L )\) delle proposizioni (o formule proposizionali) su
   \(L\) è un sottoinsieme di \[( L \cup \left \{ {(}, {)} , {\neg} , {\vee}
   , {\wedge} , {\to} , {\leftrightarrow} \right \} ) ^* ,\] l’insieme di
   tutte le stringhe finite di simboli che sono elementi di \(L\) oppure
   connettivi o parentesi. \(Prop ( L )\) è definito dalle clausole

     * Se \(\mathrm{A} \in L\) allora \(( \mathrm{A} ) \in Prop ( L )\).

     * Se \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop ( L )\) allora \(( \neg \mathrm{P} ) \in Prop
       ( L )\).

     * Se \(\Box\) è un connettivo binario (ovvero \(\Box \in \left \{ {\vee}
       , {\wedge} , {\to} , {\leftrightarrow} \right \}\)), e se \(\mathrm{P}
       , \mathrm{Q} \in Prop ( L )\) allora \(( \mathrm{P} \mathrel{\Box}
       \mathrm{Q} ) \in Prop ( L )\).

   Le clausole della definizione sono anche regole di costruzione: s’intende
   che ogni proposizione si ottiene applicando un numero finito di volte le
   clausole della definizione.

   Formalmente

   Definizione Per \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) definiamo \(Prop_{n}( L )\) un
   sottoinsieme di \(( L \cup \left \{{(}, {)} , {\neg} , {\vee} , {\wedge} ,
   {\to} , {\leftrightarrow} \right \} ) ^*\) per ricorsione mediante le
   clausole

   \[Prop_{0} ( L )\] \[=\] \[\left \{ ( \mathrm{A} ) \boldsymbol\mid         
                            \mathrm{A }\in L \right\}\]                       
                            \[Prop_{n} ( L ) \cup \left \{( \neg \mathrm{P} ) 
                            \boldsymbol\mid \mathrm{P} \in Prop_{n} ( L )     
   \[Prop_{n + 1} ( L       \right\} \cup \left \{( \mathrm{P} \mathrel{\Box} 
   )\]                \[=\] \mathrm{Q} ) \boldsymbol\mid \mathrm{P} ,         
                            \mathrm{Q} \in Prop_{n} ( L ) , \; \Box \in \left 
                            \{ {\vee} , {\wedge} , {\to} , {\leftrightarrow}  
                            \right \} \right\}\]                              

   Quindi \(Prop_{0} ( L ) \subseteq Prop_{1} ( L ) \subseteq \dotsc\) e
   \[Prop ( L ) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} Prop_{n} ( L )\]

   Le lettere \(\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{Q} , \mathrm{R} , \dots\) (eventualmente
   con pedici e apici) variano su elementi di \(Prop ( L )\).

Proposizioni atomiche e connettivi principali

   Le proposizioni della forma \(( \mathrm{A} )\) (per qualche \(A \in L\))
   si dicono proposizioni atomiche.

   Se una proposizione è invece della forma \((\neg \mathrm{P} )\) o della
   forma \(( \mathrm{P} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{Q} )\), \(\neg\) e \(\Box\)
   sono rispettivamente il suo connettivo principale, e \(\mathrm{P}\) e
   \(\mathrm{Q}\) le sottoproposizioni immediate.

   Una proposizione non atomica \(\mathrm{P}\) viene detta negazione,
   congiunzione, disgiunzione, implicazione oppure bi-implicazione quando il
   suo connettivo principale è \(\neg\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\),
   \(\rightarrow\) o \(\leftrightarrow\), rispettivamente.

Misure di complessità

   La lunghezza di una proposizione \(\mathrm{P}\) è la lunghezza di
   \(\mathrm{P}\) vista come stringa, \[lh \colon ( L \cup \left \{ {(}, {)}
   , {\neg} , {\vee} , {\wedge} , {\to} , {\leftrightarrow} \right \} ) ^*
   \to \mathbb{N}\] mentre l’altezza di una proposizione \(ht ( \mathrm{P}
   )\) è definita da \[ht \colon Prop ( L ) \to \mathbb{N}, \qquad ht (
   \mathrm{P} ) = \min \left \{n \in \mathbb{N} \boldsymbol\mid \mathrm{P}
   \in Prop_{n} ( L ) \right\} ,\] Per esempio se \(\mathrm{P} = ( \mathrm{A}
   )\), allora \(lh ( \mathrm{P} ) = 3\) e \(ht ( \mathrm{P} ) = 0\), mentre
   se \(\mathrm{P} = ((\neg(\mathrm{A})) \wedge ((\mathrm{B})\to
   (\neg(\mathrm{A}))))\), allora \(lh (\mathrm{P} ) = 21\) e \(ht (
   \mathrm{P} ) = 3\).

   La lunghezza e l’altezza di una proposizione si dicono misure di
   complessità e ci permettono di dimostrare fatti sulle proposizioni per
   induzione strutturale sull’insieme di stringhe \(( L \cup \left \{ {(},
   {)} , {\neg} , {\vee} , {\wedge} , {\to} , {\leftrightarrow} \right \} )
   ^*\) (usando \(lh\)) oppure sull’insieme \(Prop(L)\) delle proposizioni
   (usando \(ht\)).

   Per ogni \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop ( L )\)

     * \(\mathrm{P}\) inizia con una parentesi sinistra “\((\)”, termina con
       una parentesi destra “\()\)”,

     * ogni parentesi sinistra ha una sua parentesi di chiusura destra,

     * \(lh ( \mathrm{P} )\) è divisibile per \(3\).

   Dimostrazione. (Per induzione strutturale sull’altezza di \(\mathrm{P}\))
   Se \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop_{0} ( L )\) (ossia \(ht(\mathrm{P})=0\)), allora
   \(\mathrm{P} = ( \mathrm{A} )\) per qualche \(\mathrm{A} \in L\) e il
   risultato segue immediatamente.

   Supponiamo ora che il risultato valga per ogni proposizione in \(Prop_{n}
   ( L )\) (ossia ogni \(\mathrm{P}\) tale che \(ht(\mathrm{P})=n\)) e
   dimostriamo che allora vale anche per ogni proposizione in \(Prop_{n + 1}
   ( L )\) (ossia ogni \(\mathrm{P}\) tale che \(ht(\mathrm{P})=n+1\)).
   Fissiamo dunque una generica \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop_{n + 1} ( L )\).

     * Se \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop_{n} ( L )\) il risultato segue immediatamente
       dall’ipotesi induttiva.

     * Se \(\mathrm{P} = ( \mathrm{Q} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{R} )\) con
       \(\mathrm{Q} , \mathrm{R} \in Prop_{n} ( L )\), allora chiaramente
       \(\mathrm{P}\) inizia con una parentesi sinistra “\(\; (\)” e termina
       con una parentesi destra “\(\; )\)”. Inoltre, per ipotesi induttiva
       ogni parentesi sinistra che compare in \(\mathrm{Q}\) ha la sua
       parentesi di chiusura destra in \(\mathrm{Q}\) stesso, e la stessa
       cosa vale per \(\mathrm{R}\); poichè l’unica parentesi sinistra di
       \(\mathrm{P}\) che compare fuori da \(\mathrm{Q}\) e \(\mathrm{R}\) è
       quella iniziale, la cui parentesi destra di chiusura è la parentesi
       finale, si ha che il medesimo risultato vale per \(P\). Infine, se
       \(lh ( \mathrm{Q} ) = 3i\) e \(lh ( R ) = 3j\), allora \(lh (
       \mathrm{P} ) = 1 + 3i + 1 + 3j + 1 = 3 ( i + j + 1 )\).

     * Se \(\mathrm{P} = ( \neg \mathrm{Q} )\) con \(\mathrm{Q} \in Prop_{n}
       ( L )\), allora chiaramente \(\mathrm{P}\) inizia con una parentesi
       sinistra “\(\; (\)” e termina con una parentesi destra “\(\; )\)”. Per
       ipotesi induttiva, ogni parentesi sinistra che compare in
       \(\mathrm{Q}\) ha la sua parentesi destra di chiusura in
       \(\mathrm{Q}\) stesso; poichè l’unica parentesi sinistra di
       \(\mathrm{P}\) che compare fuori da \(\mathrm{Q}\) è quella iniziale,
       la cui parentesi destra di chiusura è la parentesi finale, si ha che
       il medesimo risultato vale per \(P\). Infine, se \(lh ( \mathrm{Q} ) =
       3i\), allora \(lh ( \mathrm{P} ) = 1 + 1 + 3i + 1 = 3 ( i + 1 )\).

Esempi

   Siano \(\mathrm{A} , \mathrm{B} \in L\).

    1. \(\mathrm{A} \wedge \mathrm{B}\) è una proposizione? No, perchè ogni
       proposizione contiene almeno una parentesi.

    2. \() \mathrm{A} (\) è una proposizione? No, come non lo sono
       \(\mathrm{A}\) o \() \mathrm{A} )\), perchè ogni proposizione inizia
       con una parentesi \((\) e termina con una parentesi \()\).

    3. \(( ( \mathrm{A} ) \to ( \mathrm{B} ) )\) è una proposizione? Sì,
       perchè ottenuta dalle \(( \mathrm{A} )\) e \(( \mathrm{B} )\) con una
       applicazione della clausola induttiva relativa a \(\rightarrow\).

    4. \(( \neg ( ( \mathrm{A} ) \to ( \mathrm{B} ) ) )\) è una proposizione?
       Sì, perchè ottenuta da \(( \mathrm{A} )\) e \(( \mathrm{B} )\) con una
       prima applicazione della clausola induttiva relativa a \(\rightarrow\)
       e una seconda applicazione della clausola relativa a \(\neg\).

    5. \(( ( \mathrm{A} )\) è una proposizione? No, perchè c’è una parentesi
       sinistra che non ha la sua parentesi destra di chiusura.

    6. \(( \mathrm{A} \mathrm{B} )\) è una proposizione? No, perchè non è
       atomica e non contiene nessun connettivo.

                     Albero sintattico di una proposizione

   Una proposizione è una lista di simboli, ma è anche passibile di una
   rappresentazione con una diversa struttura. A ogni proposizione è
   associato un albero di costruzione, o albero sintattico, che è un albero
   etichettato finito binario.

   Un albero finito è un insieme \(X\) parzialmente ordinato, cioè con una
   relazione binaria \(\preceq\) definita su \(X\), con le seguenti
   proprietà:

     * \(\preceq\) è una relazione di ordine su \(X\) tale che per ogni \(x
       \in X\) l’insieme \(\left \{y \in X \boldsymbol\mid y \preceq x
       \right\}\) dei predecessori di \(x\) è finito e linearmente ordinato
       da \(\preceq\). Gli elementi di \(X\) vengono detti nodi. Se \(x
       \preceq y\), si dice che \(y\) è un successore, o un discendente di
       \(x\). I nodi \(a\) tali che non esiste \(b \neq a\) per cui \(a
       \preceq b\) si chiamano foglie.

     * Esiste un nodo minimo rispetto a \(\preceq\), ovvero un nodo \(r\)
       tale che \(r \preceq x\) per ogni nodo di \(X\). Tale nodo si chiama
       radice.

   L’albero si dice binario se

     * Ogni nodo che non sia una foglia ha uno o al massimo due successori
       immediati, dove si dice che \(b\) è un successore immediato di \(a\)
       se \(a \preceq b\), \(a \neq b\) e non esiste un \(c\) tale che \(a
       \preceq c \preceq b\), con \(c \neq a\) e \(c \neq b\).

   La rappresentazione usuale di un albero binario è di questo tipo, dove la
   radice è in alto e l’albero cresce verso il basso:

   Didascalia figura: Esempio di rappresentazione di albero binario. I nodi
   sono disposti su quattro righe. Nell prima riga si trova la radice (un
   unico nodo). Nella seconda riga ci sono due nodi connessi con la radice.
   Nella terza riga ci sono tre nodi: due nodi connessi con il nodo di
   sinistra della riga precedente, un nodo connesso con il nodo di destra
   della riga precedente. Nella quarta riga c’è un solo nodo connesso con il
   secondo nodo della riga precedente.

   Un ramo è un insieme totalmente ordinato di nodi che va dalla radice a una
   foglia. La sua lunghezza è il numero di nodi che vi appartengono.
   L’altezza dell’albero è la massima lunghezza dei suoi rami.

   Un albero si dice etichettato se ad ogni nodo è associato un elemento di
   qualche insieme prefissato, che si chiama etichetta (label). Le etichette
   si possono sovrapporre ed identificare con i nodi.

   Costruzione dell’albero sintattico

   Algoritmo per costruire l’albero sintattico L’albero sintattico di una
   proposizione \(\mathrm{P}\) è definito in questo modo:

    1. la radice è (etichettata con) la proposizione data;

    2. ogni nodo ha nessuno, uno o due successori immediati a seconda che la
       proposizione etichetta del nodo sia atomica, della forma \(( \neg
       \mathrm{Q} )\) (ovvero il suo connettivo principale è \(\neg\)), o
       della forma \(( \mathrm{Q} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{R} )\) (ovvero il
       suo connettivo principale è un connettivo binario \(\Box\)),
       rispettivamente. Nel secondo caso il successore è etichettato con
       \(\mathrm{Q}\), nel terzo caso i due successori sono etichettati
       rispettivamente con \(\mathrm{Q}\) e con \(\mathrm{R}\).

   Questo descrive un algoritmo che, partendo dalla radice etichettata con la
   proposizione iniziale, permette di costruire l’albero sintattico
   applicando ripetutamente la condizione 2 ai nodi costruiti al passo
   precedente.

   Esempio

   L’albero sintattico di \(( ( ( \mathrm{A} ) \wedge ( \neg ( \mathrm{B} ) )
   ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( \mathrm{A} ) ) )\) è il seguente:

   Didascalia figura: Albero sintattico di \( ( ( ( \mathrm {A} ) \wedge (
   \neg ( \mathrm {B} ) ) ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( \mathrm {A} ) ) ) \)

   L’albero è completo perchè tutte le sue foglie sono etichettate con
   proposizioni atomiche (quindi l’algoritmo termina).

     * Le etichette dei nodi dell’albero di costruzione di una proposizione
       sono le sue sottoproposizioni.

     * Si dice che un simbolo occorre in una proposizione se è un elemento
       della stringa (che è la proposizione). Le occorrenze di un simbolo in
       una proposizione sono i vari posti della stringa in cui il simbolo si
       presenta, e il numero di occorrenze di un simbolo è il numero di volte
       che compare nella stringa.

     * Le lettere che compaiono nelle (proposizioni atomiche nelle) foglie
       sono le lettere che occorrono nella proposizione.

   Algoritmo per costruire l’albero sintattico L’albero sintattico di una
   proposizione \(\mathrm{P}\) è definito in questo modo:

    1. la radice è (etichettata con) la proposizione data;

    2. ogni nodo ha nessuno, uno o due successori immediati a seconda che la
       proposizione etichetta del nodo sia atomica, della forma \(( \neg
       \mathrm{Q} )\) (ovvero il suo connettivo principale è \(\neg\)), o
       della forma \(( \mathrm{Q} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{R} )\) (ovvero il
       suo connettivo principale è un connettivo binario \(\Box\)),
       rispettivamente. Nel secondo caso il successore è etichettato con
       \(\mathrm{Q}\), nel terzo caso i due successori sono etichettati
       rispettivamente con \(\mathrm{Q}\) e con \(\mathrm{R}\).

   Per eseguire lo step 2 è necessario avere un metodo (= algoritmo) che
   permetta di determinare, se esiste, qual è il connettivo principale della
   proposizione nell’etichetta del nodo in esame: ad esempio, come si fa a
   determinare il connettivo principale della proposizione seguente?
   \[(((\neg(((\mathrm{A})\to (\mathrm{B})) \vee (\mathrm{C}))) \to
   ((\mathrm{A}) \wedge ((\mathrm{B}) \to (\mathrm{C})))) \wedge
   (\neg((\mathrm{A}) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{A}) \vee (\mathrm{B})))))\]

   Le parentesi sono essenziali per individuare il connettivo principale di
   una proposizione, e quindi per costruire il suo albero sintattico.

   Contatore di parentesi Consideriamo la stringa \[(((\neg ( \mathrm{A} ))
   \to (\mathrm{B})) \wedge (\neg(\mathrm{B})))\] e supponiamo di voler
   trovare la parentesi che chiude la parentesi sinistra evidenziata in
   azzurro. Possiamo allora utilizzare un contatore che scorre la lista da
   sinistra verso destra partendo dalla parentesi cui siamo interessati, e
   scatta di \(+1\) quando incontra una parentesi sinistra, di \(-1\) quando
   incontra una parentesi destra. La prima parentesi su cui il contatore
   torna a \(0\) è proprio la parentesi di chiusura cercata. Nel nostro
   esempio:

   Contatore: 0/1/2/3

   Le parentesi sono essenziali per individuare il connettivo principale di
   una proposizione, e quindi per costruire il suo albero sintattico.

   Come si individua il connettivo principale? Sia \(P\) una proposizione non
   atomica. Il primo simbolo di \(P\) sarà sempre (, mentre il secondo
   simbolo sarà o \(\neg\) oppure un’altra parentesi (.

     * Nel primo caso il connettivo principale è proprio \(\neg\) e ciò che
       lo segue esclusa l’ultima parentesi ) è la sua sottoproposizione
       principale.

       Esempio: \(( \neg ( \neg (\mathrm{A}) \to (\mathrm{B})))\).

     * Nel secondo caso, occorre trovare innanzitutto la parentesi che chiude
       quella che si trova al secondo posto: il simbolo che lo segue è il
       connettivo principale e le due sottoproposizioni principali sono tutto
       ciò che precede e segue tale connettivo escluse le parentesi iniziali
       e finali.

       Esempio: \(((( \mathrm{B}) \to ( \mathrm{A})) \vee ( \neg ( \mathrm{B}
       )))\)

   Algoritmo per costruire l’albero sintattico L’albero sintattico di una
   proposizione \(\mathrm{P}\) è definito in questo modo:

    1. la radice è (etichettata con) la proposizione data;

    2. ogni nodo ha nessuno, uno o due successori immediati a seconda che la
       proposizione etichetta del nodo sia atomica, della forma \(( \neg
       \mathrm{Q} )\) (ovvero il suo connettivo principale è \(\neg\)), o
       della forma \(( \mathrm{Q} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{R} )\) (ovvero il
       suo connettivo principale è un connettivo binario \(\Box\)),
       rispettivamente. Nel secondo caso il successore è etichettato con
       \(\mathrm{Q}\), nel terzo caso i due successori sono etichettati
       rispettivamente con \(\mathrm{Q}\) e con \(\mathrm{R}\).

   Attenzione! Se si raggiunge un nodo etichettato con una stringa che non è
   una formula atomica e non è nemmeno della forma \((\neg \mathrm{Q})\) o
   \((\mathrm{Q} \mathrel{\Box} \mathrm{R})\), l’algoritmo termina
   immediatamente e si conclude che \(\mathrm{P}\) NON era una proposizione
   ben formata (ovvero \(\mathrm{P} \notin Prop(L)\)).

   Se invece questo non accade mai, dopo un certo numero di passi tutti i
   nodi privi di successori saranno etichettati con proposizioni atomiche:
   l’algoritmo quindi termina e quello costruito è l’albero sintattico di
   \(\mathrm{P}\).

   Dunque l’algoritmo per la costruzione dell’albero sintattico permette di

     * determinare se la stringa \(\mathrm{P}\) che viene data come input è
       una proposizione ben formata (ovvero un elemento di \(Prop(L)\))
       oppure no;

     * nel caso in cui \(\mathrm{P} \in Prop(L)\), individuarne tutte le
       sottoproposizioni e l’ordine con cui le regole di costruzione delle
       proposizioni sono state applicate ad esse per costruire
       \(\mathrm{P}\).

   Inoltre, l’albero sintattico permette anche di determinare l’altezza della
   proposizione \(\mathrm{P}\): infatti, si dimostra facilmente per induzione
   strutturale che \(ht(\mathrm{P})\) coincide con l’altezza del suo albero
   di costruzione diminuita di una unità, ovvero con la massima lunghezza di
   un cammino che congiunga la radice a un nodo terminale.

   Esempio

   Sia \(\mathrm{P}\) la proposizione \(( ( ( \mathrm{A} ) \wedge ( \neg (
   \mathrm{B} ) ) ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( \mathrm{A} ) ) )\). Abbiamo visto
   che il suo albero sintattico è il seguente:

   Didascalia figura: Albero sintattico della proposizione \( ( ( ( \mathrm
   {A} ) \wedge ( \neg ( \mathrm {B} ) ) ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( \mathrm {A} )
   ) ) \)

   Siccome l’altezza dell’albero è \(4\), l’altezza della proposizione
   \(ht(\mathrm{P})\) è \(4-1\), ovvero \(3\).

   Esercizio Verificare quali delle seguenti stringhe sono proposizioni e
   quali no, costruendone l’albero sintattico e spiegando dove eventualmente
   la costruzione fallisce e per quale ragione:

     * \(( ( \mathrm{A} ) \rightarrow ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \vee (\neg (
       \mathrm{C} ) ) ) )\)

     * \(( ( \neg ( \mathrm{A} ) ) \wedge ( \mathrm{B} ) ) \vee ( \mathrm{C}
       ) )\)

     * \((\neg \neg (( \mathrm{A} ) \rightarrow ( \mathrm{B} ) ) )\)

     * \(( ( ( ( \mathrm{A} ) \rightarrow ( \mathrm{B} ) ) \wedge (
       \mathrm{A} ) ) \rightarrow ( \mathrm{B} ) )\)

     * \(( ( ( \neg ( \mathrm{A} )) \wedge ( \mathrm{B} ) ) \vee ( \mathrm{C}
       ) )\)

     * \((\neg (\neg \mathrm{A} ) )\)

     * \((( \mathrm{A} ) \wedge ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge ( \mathrm{C} ) )\).

                          Convenzioni sulle parentesi

   Alcune parentesi sono sovrabbondanti: ad esempio, quelle della coppia più
   esterna e quelle nelle proposizioni atomiche, dove sono usate sia per
   uniformità sia per sottolineare la differenza tra una lettera come
   elemento dell’alfabeto e la lettera come proposizione.

   Per comodità di scrittura e lettura riduciamo il numero di parentesi con
   le convenzioni seguenti.

     * Non si scrivono le parentesi nelle proposizioni atomiche e non si
       scrivono le parentesi più esterne.

     * Si eliminano alcune coppie di parentesi intorno ad alcune
       sottoproposizioni, utilizzando il criterio di priorità tra connettivi
       dato dalla seguente graduatoria: \[\neg\] \[\wedge \quad \vee\]
       \[\rightarrow\] \[\leftrightarrow\]

     * Per occorrenze multiple dello stesso connettivo si prende in esame
       l’ultima, quella più a destra; questo significa che per formule
       composte con uno stesso connettivo ripetuto si conviene l’associazione
       a destra, cioè ad esempio con \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{B}
       \rightarrow \mathrm{C}\) si intende \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow
       (\mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{C})\), e con \(\mathrm{A} \wedge
       \mathrm{B} \wedge \mathrm{C}\) si intende \(\mathrm{A} \wedge
       (\mathrm{B} \wedge \mathrm{C} )\).

   Non tutte le parentesi si possono eliminare da una proposizione!

   Esempio

   Non si possono eliminare le parentesi da \(\neg (\mathrm{A} \vee
   \mathrm{B})\). Togliendole si avrebbe infatti \(\neg \mathrm{A} \vee
   \mathrm{B}\) che, per la priorità tra connettivi che abbiamo convenuto,
   rappresenta a formula \((\neg \mathrm{A}) \vee \mathrm{B}\).

   Similmente, la scrittura \(\mathrm{A} \wedge \mathrm{B} \vee \mathrm{C}\)
   non ha una lettura univoca e quindi è considerata priva di significato: le
   convenzioni sulle parentesi date non permette di capire se si intenda
   considerare la formula \((\mathrm{A} \wedge \mathrm{B}) \vee \mathrm{C}\)
   oppure \(\mathrm{A} \wedge (\mathrm{B} \vee \mathrm{C} )\) (poichè
   \(\wedge\) e \(\vee\) hanno la stessa priorità!).

   Riassumendo: si possono eliminare parentesi fin tanto che il significato
   dell’espressione risultante resta univocamente determinato ed identico a
   quello della proposizione originale (ovvero alla versione formale con
   tutte le parentesi). Questo vuol dire che, utilizzando le convenzioni
   date, si devono poter reintrodurre le parentesi senza ambiguità, fino a
   ricostruire la proposizione originale.

   Esempi

   Data \(\mathrm{A} \wedge \neg \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \neg \mathrm{A}\), la
   reintroduzione delle parentesi avviene attraverso questa successione di
   passi:

    1. \((\mathrm{A} ) \wedge \neg (\mathrm{B} ) \rightarrow \neg (
       \mathrm{A} )\)

    2. \((\mathrm{A}) \wedge \neg (\mathrm{B}) \rightarrow (\neg
       (\mathrm{A}))\)

    3. \((\mathrm{A}) \wedge (\neg (\mathrm{B})) \rightarrow (\neg
       (\mathrm{A}))\)

    4. \(((\mathrm{A}) \wedge (\neg (\mathrm{B}))) \rightarrow (\neg
       (\mathrm{A}))\)

    5. \((((\mathrm{A}) \wedge (\neg (\mathrm{B}))) \rightarrow (\neg
       (\mathrm{A})))\).

   I passi 2 e 3 si possono naturalmente fare in parallelo.

   Reintrodurre le parentesi in \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \neg (\mathrm{B}
   \wedge \neg \neg \mathrm{C} )\)

    1. \((\mathrm{A}) \rightarrow \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge \neg \neg (
       \mathrm{C} ) )\)

    2. \((\mathrm{A}) \rightarrow \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge \neg (\neg (
       \mathrm{C} ) ) )\)

    3. \((\mathrm{A}) \rightarrow \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge (\neg (\neg (
       \mathrm{C} ) ) ) )\)

    4. \(( \mathrm{A}) \rightarrow ( \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge (\neg (\neg
       ( \mathrm{C} ) ) ) ) )\)

    5. \(( ( \mathrm{A} ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge (\neg
       (\neg ( \mathrm{C} ) ) ) ) ) )\)

   oppure, per rendere più chiara la lettura

    1. \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \neg (\mathrm{B} \wedge \neg (\neg \mathrm{C}
       ) )\)

    2. \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \neg (\mathrm{B} \wedge (\neg ( \neg
       \mathrm{C} ) ) )\)

    3. \(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow (\neg (\mathrm{B} \wedge (\neg (\neg
       \mathrm{C} ) ) ) )\)

    4. \(( \mathrm{A} \rightarrow ( \neg (\mathrm{B} \wedge (\neg (\neg
       \mathrm{C} ) ) ) ) )\)

   rimettendo infine le parentesi intorno alle lettere

    1. \(( ( \mathrm{A} ) \rightarrow ( \neg ( ( \mathrm{B} ) \wedge (\neg
       (\neg ( \mathrm{C} ) ) ) ) ) )\)

   L’albero sintattico si può costruire direttamente anche per le espressioni
   in cui sono state omesse le parentesi seguendo le convenzioni stabilite.

   Il connettivo principale è sempre quello di priorità più bassa tra quelli
   non contenuti in alcuna coppia di parentesi; se ve n’è più di uno con
   queste caratteristiche, il connettivo principale è quello più a sinistra
   tra di essi.

   Esempio

   L’albero sintattico di \(\mathrm{A} \wedge \neg \mathrm{B} \rightarrow
   \neg \mathrm{A}\) è il seguente, essendo \(\rightarrow\) il connettivo
   principale:

   Didascalia figura: Albero sintattico di \(\mathrm{A} \wedge \neg
   \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \neg \mathrm{A}\)

   L’albero sintattico può essere ulteriormente semplificato etichettando le
   foglie con le formule atomiche, e tutti gli altri nodi con il solo
   connettivo che serve per costruire la (sotto)proposizione corrispondente a
   partire dalle (sotto)proposizioni nei suoi successori immediati.

   Esempio

   L’albero sintattico di \((\mathrm{A} \wedge \neg \mathrm{B}) \vee \neg
   \mathrm{A}\)

   Per semplificare la lettura di alcune formule, nella pratica ometteremo
   spesso molte parentesi (ma non tutte) e useremo anche le parentesi quadre
   \[[ \qquad ]\] al posto di quelle tonde.

   Esempio

   Per esempio scriveremo espressioni come \[(\mathrm{A}\wedge\neg
   \mathrm{B})\rightarrow[\neg \mathrm{C}\leftrightarrow (\mathrm{B}\vee \neg
   \mathrm{D})].\]

   Tale espressione non è altro che una “semplificazione” della proposizione
   che si ottiene sostituendo le parentesi quadre con le parentesi tonde e
   reintroducendo tutte le parentesi nella maniera opportuna, ovvero della
   proposizione \[(((\mathrm{A})\wedge(\neg
   (\mathrm{B})))\rightarrow((\neg(\mathrm{C}))\leftrightarrow
   ((\mathrm{B})\vee (\neg (\mathrm{D}))))).\]

   Esercizio

   Reintrodurre le parentesi nelle seguenti stringhe in modo da ottenere, se
   possibile, proposizioni, o se no spiegare il perchè.

   [IMG]Un albero binario

   In informatica un albero binario è un albero i cui nodi hanno grado
   compreso tra 0 e 2. Per albero si intende un grafo non diretto, connesso e
   aciclico mentre per grado di un nodo si intende il numero di sotto alberi
   del nodo, che è uguale al numero di figli del nodo.

   Anche l'albero costituito da un solo nodo e nessun arco si considera un
   albero binario valido, sebbene il grado del nodo in questo caso sia nullo.

   Come nel caso generale degli alberi è possibile individuare (in maniera
   non unica) un nodo radice: qualunque nodo di grado minore di 3 può essere
   scelto come radice dell'albero binario. Stabilito un nodo radice è
   possibile costruire delle relazioni di parentela tra nodi: il nodo radice
   non ha padre e può avere 0, 1 o 2 figli, ed ogni nodo è ovviamente padre
   dei suoi figli. Poiché tutti i nodi tranne la radice hanno un padre, per
   via della limitazione sul grado dei nodi ogni nodo può avere al massimo 2
   figli (da qui il nome "albero binario").

   I nodi senza figli vengono detti foglie o nodi terminali; un nodo non
   foglia è un nodo interno.

Implementare gli alberi binari[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   In questa sezione trattiamo l'implementazione degli alberi binari dal
   punto di vista teorico, facendo ricorso a strutture di programmazione
   generiche; sarà poi compito del programmatore decidere come implementare
   queste strutture sulla base del linguaggio di programmazione che si
   troverà ad usare.

   Esistono vari sistemi, ma il più semplice risulta essere quello che
   utilizza un array che contiene i nodi dell'albero secondo questa logica:
   la radice occupa la prima posizione dell'array e i figli di questa radice
   sono a loro volta nell'array e occupano come posizione (2i) e (2i+1) dove
   i è la posizione della radice, del padre, dei due figli.

   Si fa notare che questa implementazione è ottimale se l'albero è pieno
   cioè se tutti gli elementi che costituiscono l'albero hanno esattamente
   due figli, tranne ovviamente le foglie, altrimenti è necessario un flag
   booleano, in realtà un array di accompagnamento, che ci indica se la
   posizione è valida o meno.

   [IMG]

   Interpretiamola: in A, posizione 1, c'è sempre la radice, in posizione 2 e
   3 troviamo i figli B e C. Prendiamo il figlio B, posizione 2, i suoi figli
   sono in 4 e 5, ma, la colonna dei flag ci dice che le posizioni 4 e 5 sono
   disattivate, infatti B non ha figli, al contrario, C posizione 3, in 6 e 7
   ha proprio i valori cercati e cioè i suoi due figli D, E.

   I vantaggi dell'utilizzo di questa implementazione sono la semplicità di
   accesso e la semplicità di gestione degli elementi della lista, al
   contrario, le operazioni di inserimento e in generale la dimensione
   considerevole di un array di un grande albero giocano a sfavore di questa
   implementazione che risulta essere di conseguenza sconveniente da usare.

   Un'altra implementazione che prevede l'uso di array è quello della
   rappresentazione collegata con array, in cui, in una tabella a tre colonne
   abbiamo, rispettivamente per riga, in quella centrale il valore, in quella
   sinistra l'indirizzo del figlio sinistro e in quella destra l'indirizzo di
   quello destro. È necessario aggiungere una variabile inizio per indicare
   il punto in cui dobbiamo iniziare l'analisi, al contrario, se un indirizzo
   è a zero è da considerarsi NULL.

   [IMG]
   Inizio = 1

   Iniziando da 1, A ha figli che sono in 2 e 3, il figlio B non ha
   discendenti, quello C invece ha come discendenti 4 a sinistra e 5 a
   destra, cioè D ed E.

   Lo stesso risultato si può ottenere prendendo in considerazione anziché un
   array, un semplice nodo strutturato a tre campi, etichetta, figlio
   sinistro, figlio destro e con un puntatore al primo nodo, e di fatto ci
   ricolleghiamo all'immagine di accompagnamento alle due tabelle precedenti.

   Profondità di un albero: La radice r ha profondità 0, i suoi figli
   sinistro e destro, hanno profondità 1, i nipoti profondità 2 e così via.
   Quindi se la profondità di un nodo è p i suoi figli non vuoti hanno
   profondità p+1

   Per quanto riguarda l'altezza h di un albero binario è data dalla massima
   profondità raggiunta dalle sue foglie. Quindi, l'altezza misura la massima
   distanza di una foglia dalla radice dell'albero, in termini di numero di
   archi attraversati. Poiché la definizione di alberi si applica anche ai
   sotto alberi, è più efficiente e semplice trovare l'altezza di un albero
   binario osservando che l'albero composto da un solo nodo ha altezza pari a
   0, mentre un albero con almeno due nodi ha altezza pari all'altezza del
   suo sottoalbero più alto, incrementata di uno in quanto la radice
   introduce un ulteriore livello

   h=profondità del più lungo cammino

   Nel caso dell'albero nella figura qui sopra, l'altezza h è
   0(foglie)+1(figli radice)+1(radice)=2.

   Esistono alcune formule per calcolare le caratteristiche degli alberi:

   Log_{2}(n+1)-1 Altezza di un albero binario bilanciato pieno di n nodi    
   2^{{h+1}}-1    Numero massimo di nodi in un albero binario di altezza h   
   h              Altezza o numero minimo di nodi di un albero con altezza h 
   2^{l}          Numero massimo di nodi ad un livello l (elle)              

Implementare gli alberi di ricerca binari su array[modifica | modifica
wikitesto]

   Se non è necessario effettuare frequentemente operazioni di inserimento e
   cancellazioni o non è affatto necessario effettuarle e non si vuole usare
   troppa memoria è possibile implementare un albero di ricerca binario su un
   array ordinato, con la restrizione che il numero degli elementi sia
   2^{{n}}-1 con n\in \mathbb{N}.

   [IMG]

   L'immagine sopra mostra un albero di ricerca binario implementato su un
   array ordinato di 15 elementi, si comincia ponendo il centro dell'array
   come radice dell'albero e come sue foglie rispettivamente il centro della
   parte destra dell'array e il centro della parte sinistra dell'array, si
   continua applicando ricorsivamente il procedimento fino a che non sono
   stati coperti tutti gli elementi. Si ottiene quindi l'equivalente
   dell'albero

   [IMG]

   lo pseudo-algoritmo per la ricerca di una chiave è

 Ricerca di una chiave
    N:= numero di elementi dell'albero (2^k-1)
    A:= array delle N chiavi ordinate in ordine crescente, A[0], A[1] .. A[N - 1]
    key:= chiave da cercare
    jump:= (N + 1)/4
    i: = (N - 1)/2
    while jump @gt; 0 do
        if key == A[i] then
            ricerca finita
        else if key @lt; A[i] then
            i = i - jump
        else if key @gt; A[i] then
            i = i + jump
        endif
        jump = jump / 2
    done
    nessun risultato

   Suddetta modalità di visualizzazione di un albero binario sfrutta la
   definizione di skip-list, ossia di albero binario i cui elementi sono
   ordinati e si sfrutta una algoritmo randomizzato. In una skip list per
   cercare un elemento non facciamo altro che creare nuove liste a partire da
   quella di partenza L0, dimezzando ogni volta gli elementi seguendo la
   regola (n/2^i)=2, cioè sappiamo che possiamo creare Li liste fino a che
   non arriviamo alla lista con il minor numero di elementi, ossia 2. La skip
   list è molto utile se vogliamo trovare un elemento in quanto nella ricerca
   dobbiamo partire dalla lista L(lgn) e scendere cercando sempre il primo
   elemento più grande del valore cercato x; è un buon algoritmo anche se è
   costoso in termini di spazio, ma è più difficile aggiungere o cancellare
   un elemento.

Implementare gli alberi binari tramite puntatori[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Un modo semplice per implementare gli alberi binari di ricerca è quello di
   usare i puntatori. Nell'implementazione classica ogni nodo dell'albero
   oltre al suo valore ha un puntatore al figlio destro ed uno al figlio
   sinistro, in questo modo è possibile, partendo dalla radice, discendere
   nell'albero fino ad arrivare alle foglie. Tutti i nodi sono uguali,
   l'unica differenza è che nessun nodo punterà alla radice (infatti la
   radice non è né un figlio destro, né un figlio sinistro), e le foglie non
   avendo figli non punteranno a nulla (nil, NULL value).

  Una semplice implementazione in C[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

 /*************************************************************************************************************
 * In questo file verranno incluse le funzioni necessarie a costruire un albero binario,
 * e gestirlo tramite
 * i puntatori che ogni radice ha verso il figlio destro e il figlio sinistro.
 * L'interfaccia è abbastanza semplice, una volta avviato si arriva ad un menu.
 * Si consiglia per compilarlo sotto *nix di usare "gcc -o btree binarytree.c" ,
 * Per avviarlo invece, come suggerisce l'ERRORE di parametri
 * sarà utile seguire la forma ./btree @lt;nomefile@gt;, in cui nomefile può anche contenere il path completo.
 * i dati presenti in nomefile devono essere degli interi separati da spazi.

  Determinazione della larghezza[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   La larghezza di un albero binario corrisponde al numero massimo di nodi
   giacenti al medesimo livello.

   La determinazione di suddetta grandezza può essere ottenuta attraverso
   un'opportuna modifica della Visita in-order: si fa uso di un vettore,
   dimensionato al pari del numero di nodi, inizialmente con valori tutti
   uguali a zero; la funzione WrapperLarghezza è deputata al passaggio
   corretto dei parametri alla funzione ricorsiva Larghezza , che ritorna il
   valore massimo contenuto nel vettore, cioè la larghezza dell'albero.

 INIZIO

 WrapperLarghezza(radice albero)

     Inizializzazione array livelli;
     Larghezza(radice albero,array livelli,0);
     larghezza = CercaMassimoVettore(array livelli);
     return larghezza;

 Larghezza (radice albero,array livelli,livellocorrente)
    Se radice albero == NULL (se l'albero è vuoto)
         return;

                              Gli alberi                              [IMG][IMG] 

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organizzazioni di dati:                                                          
  * Lineari: ogni elemento ha un solo predecessore e un solo successore.         
  * Non lineare o gerarchico: ad esempio gli alberi. Un albero si compone di due 
    componenti: il nodo (che contiene le informazioni) e l'arco (che collega     
    gerarchicamente coppie di nodi). Un nodo in un albero possiede un solo       
    predecessore, ma può avere molti successori.                                 
                                                                                 
Come in botanica, un albero ha una radice, un tronco che si può dividere in due  
o più rami, che a loro volta possono ridividersi. Si rappresenta tuttavia con la 
radice in alto (come un albero genealogico). Nell'esempio vediamo un albero i    
cui nodi contengono valori interi (la radice contiene il valore 10).             
Un albero può essere vuoto (se non ha nessun nodo), oppure ha un nodo radice che 
ha una sequenza di zero o più nodi figli, i quali sono a loro volta radici di    
altrettanti sotto-alberi .                                                       
                                                                                 
Gli alberi si prestano per rappresentare organizzazioni gerarchiche di           
informazioni, ad esempio: file system.

[IMG][IMG]                    Alberi: terminologia                    [IMG][IMG] 

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Per chiamare i nodi di un albero e le relazioni tra di essi si usano termini     
botanici e genealogici o di parentela.                                           
Il predecessore di un nodo è detto padre, mentre i successori sono detti figli.  
                                                                                 
La relazione antenato-discendente generalizza quella di padre-figlio nel modo    
intuitivo. Un nodo che non ha predecessori è detto radice ed è l'unico per       
l'albero.                                                                        
Un nodo senza successori è detto foglia.                                         
Si parla di profondità (ovvero l'altezza dell'albero) e ampiezza (ovvero la      
larghezza).                                                                      
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
[IMG][IMG]                      Gli alberi binari                     [IMG][IMG] 
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
Un albero binario è un albero in cui ogni nodo ha al massimo due figli. Se il    
sottoalbero sinistro (risp. destro) di un albero non è vuoto, la sua radice      
viene detta figlio sinistro (risp. destro) della radice dell'intero albero (che  
è il padre).                                                                     
                                                                                 
Ad esempio, nell'albero seguente [il nodo contenente] 10 è la radice             
dell'albero, ed ha sia un figlio sinistro (20) che un figlio destro (2). I nodi  
1, 29 e 7 sono foglie. Il nodo 20 è il padre di 3 e un antenato di 29, che è un  
discendente di 10. Il nodo 3 ha soltanto il figlio sinistro, perché il suo       
sottoalbero destro è vuoto.                                                      
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
++                                                                               
++                                                                               
                                                                                 
Gli alberi binari hanno una elegante definizione ricorsiva:                      
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| Un albero binario è una struttura definita su un insieme di nodi che:        | 
|   * non contiene nessun nodo (albero vuoto), oppure                          | 
|   * contiene un nodo radice, un albero binario detto sottoalbero sinistro ed | 
|     un albero binario detto sottoalbero destro.                              | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
                                                                                 
Molti algoritmi su alberi binari possono essere descritti in modo naturale       
sfruttando questa definizione ricorsiva, comprendendo un caso base (per l'albero 
vuoto) e una clausola ricorsiva (con due chiamate ricorsive, per i due           
sottoalberi).

[IMG][IMG]                 Visita di un albero binario                [IMG][IMG] 

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Visitare" un albero significa esaminare sequenzialmente tutti i suoi nodi. Ci   
sono tre tipi principali di visite:                                              
  * Nella visita in ordine simmetrico si visita il sottoalbero sinistro, quindi  
    si esamina la radice e infine si visita il sottoalbero destro.               
  * Nella visita in ordine anticipato si esamina prima la radice e quindi si     
    visitano il sottoalbero sinistro e quello destro.                            
  * Nella visita in ordine posticipato si visitano prima il sottoalbero sinistro 
    poi quello destro e infine si esamina la radice.                             
Altri tre tipi di visite si ottengono dai precedenti scambiando "sinistro" con   
"destro".                                                                        
                                                                                 
Ricerca in un albero binario: usando una visita in ordine qualsiasi, si può      
stabilire se un certo oggetto appartiene o meno ad un dato albero binario. Si    
noti che:                                                                        
  * il caso base è banale (come sempre): se l'albero è vuoto, si restituisce     
    false;                                                                       
  * la visita viene interrotta non appena si trova l'oggetto cercato.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Un albero binario di ricerca (ABR)  è un albero binario tale che:                
  * sui valori delle chiavi dei suoi nodi è definito un ordinamento totale;      
  * soddisfa la seguente proprietà:                                              
                                                                                 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+                 
|  Per ogni nodo n dell'albero:                                |                 
|                                                              |                 
|   * tutte le chiavi dei nodi contenuti nel sottoalbero       |                 
|     sinistro di n hanno valore strettamente minore della     |                 
|     chiave contenuta in n,                                   |                 
|   * tutte le chiavi dei nodi contenuti nel sottoalbero       |                 
|     destro di n hanno valore strettamente maggiore della     |                 
|     chiave contenuta in n.                                   |                 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+                 
                                                                                 
Un esempio, in cui le chiavi sono interi con l'ovvio ordinamento...              
                                                                                 
Si noti che in un ABR non ci possono essere due nodi con la stessa chiave.       
                                                                                 
Un'importante proprietà di un ABR è la seguente:                                 
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+                 
|                                                              |                 
|   La visita in ordine simmetrico di un albero binario di     |                 
|   ricerca genera una sequenza crescente di tutte le sue      |                 
|   chiavi.                                                    |                 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+                 
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
[IMG][IMG]                          Ricerca in un ABR                            
                                                                                 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                                                 
Per la ricerca di un elemento in un albero binario di ricerca vediamo il primo   
esempio di algoritmo che sfrutta la proprietà (ABR). Come nel caso della ricerca 
binaria su un array, ogni indagine nell'ABR permette di eliminare metà degli     
elementi su cui continuare la ricerca. Tecnicamente questo permette di ridurre   
la ricorsione doppia, tipica degli algoritmi su alberi binari, ad una ricorsione 
singola.                                                                         
                                                                                 
L'algoritmo è il seguente:                                                       
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+                 
|   * Se l'albero è vuoto la ricerca termina subito con        |                 
|     fallimento.                                              |                 
|   * Se l'albero non è vuoto, si confronta il valore cercato  |                 
|     con quello contenuto nella radice dell'albero:           |                 
|        * Se i due valori coincidono la ricerca termina con   |                 
|          successo.                                           |                 
|        * Se il valore cercato è minore di quello contenuto   |                 
|          nella radice la ricerca prosegue ricorsivamente nel |                 
|          sottoalbero sinistro.                               |                 
|        * Se è invece maggiore la ricerca prosegue nel        |

                        Sulla complessità della ricerca                          
                                                                                 
Si confrontino gli algoritmi di ricerca visti. In un albero binario, nel caso    
pessimo (ad esempio, se la chiave cercata non esiste) dobbiamo visitare tutti i  
nodi, quindi la complessità è lineare nel numero dei nodi.                       
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
In un albero binario di ricerca, ad ogni passo si visita un solo sottoalbero:    
infatti le due chiamate ricorsive compaiono nel metodo in rami mutuamente        
esclusivi. Di conseguenza nel caso pessimo la ricerca ha una complessità         
proporzionale alla massima profondità dell'albero.                               
                                                                                 
Se l'ABR è bilanciato si dimostra che la sua profondità è logaritmica nel numero 
di nodi e quindi anche la complessità della ricerca diviene logaritmica.         
                                                                                 
Ad esempio, per scoprire che 45 non è presente nel seguente albero, con il primo 
algoritmo bisogna visitare 10 nodi, con il secondo solo tre.                     
                                                                                 
Su di un albero ben bilanciato di 1000 nodi, il secondo algoritmo richiede al    
massimo una decina di passi.

           Differenza tra albero binario e albero di ricerca binario

  Albero binario

   In informatica, un albero binario (in inglese a binary tree) è una
   struttura di dati gerarchica in cui ogni nodo ha al massimo due figli
   generalmente indicati come figlio sinistro e figlio destro. Ciascun nodo
   in un albero binario contiene tre nodi che includono puntatore al
   sottoalbero sinistro , e puntatore al sottoalbero e dati elemento di
   destra . Il nodo più in alto nell’albero è indicato come radice. Di solito
   un albero vuoto è rappresentato dal puntatore NULL .

   Tipi di alberi binari basati sulla struttura

     * Albero binario radicato (ha un nodo radice e ogni nodo non ha più di
       due figli).
     * Albero binario completo (ogni nodo dell’albero non ha nessuno o almeno
       2 figli).
     * Albero degenerato (ogni nodo padre ha un solo nodo figlio. Si comporta
       come un elenco collegato).
     * Albero binario perfetto (tutti i nodi interni hanno 2 figli e le
       foglie hanno la stessa profondità o lo stesso livello.
     * Albero binario completo (ogni livello ad eccezione dell’ultimo livello
       è completamente riempito e tutti i nodi si trovano alla periferia
       sinistra.

  Albero di ricerca binario

   In informatica, gli alberi binari di ricerca  (in inglese binary search
   trees) sono una struttura di dati utile per l’aggiunta e la rimozione
   rapida dei dati. L’albero di ricerca binario è un albero binario
   organizzato in cui esiste un ordine relativo in cui i nodi dovrebbero
   essere disposti. È composto da nodi, che memorizza i dati e si collega
   anche a un massimo di altri due nodi figlio. Affinché un albero binario
   sia un albero di ricerca binario, i dati di tutti i nodi nel sottoalbero
   sinistro del nodo radice devono essere inferiori ai dati della radice. I
   dati di tutti i nodi nel sottoalbero destro del nodo radice dovrebbero
   essere maggiori di quelli uguali ai dati della radice. A questo proposito,
   le foglie più a sinistra dell’albero hanno i valori più bassi, mentre le
   foglie a destra dell’albero hanno i valori più alti.

   Tipi di albero di ricerca binario

     * T-trees
     * AVL trees
     * Splay trees
     * Tango trees
     * Red-black trees

[taddeus] quale albero piantare?

         in una aiula di dimensioni circa 4x3 vicino ad una casa in campagna,
         potete consigliarmi un albero con crescita veloce?

         avevo pensato ad un pioppo.
         cosa dite?
         però non vorrei che le radici del pioppo possano "disturbare" un
         vicino muro a secco che fa da terrapieno sottostante.

         pareri? suggerimenti?

         1... 2... 3... prova

         com'è il terreno? ombra? intendi lavorarci su o preferisci qualcosa
         che poi non perda troppe foglie/frutti?

         realizzata molti anni fa praticamente dentro un uliveto e tutto
         attorno ci sono ulivi. anche un fico ed un albicocco.
         tranne in questa grande aiula che è vuota..
         l'iaula è in zona ombrata (da albero vicino) in alcune opre del
         giorno.

         cercavo un albero veloce nella crescita e che richieda poche
         attenzioni.
         clima mediterraneo (sud italia).

         questa aiula (vicino la casa) è pianeggiante ed rettangolare ha:
         - da un lato il muretto in cemento di confine proprietà
         - da un lato un muretto a secco di confine proprietà
         - da un lato un dislivello sotto cui passa una strada (c'è un muro
         che fa da terrapieno)

         io avrei consigliato un pioppo (cresce veloce ed è bello da vedere)
         ma poi mi è sorto un dubbio:
         il mio timore è che magari tra 7-8 anni il pioppo con le sue radici
         inizi a danneggiare o la casa o uno dei muri vicini o il muro che fa
         da terrapieno!!
         che ne pensi?

         ciliegio? mmm... ma sbaglio o è lento?

         1... 2... 3... prova

         Il kaki:è il frutto più buono che c*è e fruttifica in abbondanza.Ma
         non so se è veloce.
         Il ginko è veloce, è bellissimo (d*autunno quando è tutto giallo è
         commovente), ma diventa più grosso del pioppo.
         Quindi il kaki

                Qual è il momento ideale per piantare un albero?

   29 Lug 2021 | Redazione Tubex |

   Piantare un albero è un gesto importante che fa la differenza per noi e
   per il resto del mondo. Acquistare un albero è praticamente un
   investimento che dura per tutta la vita e del quale potranno gioire anche
   le future generazioni. Per fare in modo che cresca sano e forte, è
   importante piantarlo nel modo giusto e, soprattutto, nel momento ideale.

Quando si dovrebbe eseguire la messa a dimora di un albero?

   È consigliabile piantare gli alberi durante l’inverno o in autunno, quando
   cadono le foglie. Questo è il periodo di riposo vegetativo delle piante.
   Tra l’altro, in questi mesi il clima è più fresco e spesso piovoso. Questo
   favorisce un più rapido attecchimento. Preferire questo periodo dell’anno
   per piantare un albero è la scelta ideale. In questo modo il fusto ha
   tutto il tempo per stabilirsi e per prepararsi alla primavera e
   all’estate, ovvero al momento in cui crescerà più velocemente.

In ogni caso, attenzione allo stress da trapianto!

   Gli alberi, così come le altre tipologie di vegetali, possono perdere una
   notevole parte delle loro radici durante l’espianto. Perciò, soprattutto
   dopo la messa a dimora, possono presentare una condizione che viene
   definita stress o shock da trapianto. In questi casi l’albero può
   risultare meno vitale e meno propenso ad attecchire e a svilupparsi.
   Questo può accadere indipendentemente dal momento che si è scelto per
   eseguire la messa a dimora.

   Sulla base di questo, è utile dire che piantare un albero significa
   altresì prestare molta attenzione. Sarà opportuno preparare adeguatamente
   il terreno per la messa a dimora e manipolare delicatamente la zolla.
   Questo consentirà di evitare ulteriori danni. Successivamente si potrà
   curare l’albero premurosamente.

   Non bisogna dimenticare di scegliere la giusta collocazione (più all’ombra
   o più al sole) e di usare il terriccio più adatto a favorire attecchimento
   e sviluppo. Tutto questo è ciò che serve per piantare un albero nel modo
   giusto. Aiuterà inoltre a ridurre lo shock e a far sì che la pianta si
   stabilisca più rapidamente nella nuova postazione.

   piantare un albero evitando lo stress da trapianto

Si può piantare un albero in estate?

   Gli alberi potrebbero essere piantati persino durante l’estate: tutto
   dipende dalla specie e, più in particolare, dal contesto ambientale e dal
   clima del luogo. Pertanto, è sempre opportuno reperire informazioni sulle
   caratteristiche e necessità dell’albero che si desidera mettere a dimora.
   Con le dovute attenzioni si potranno piantare alberi sani provvisti di
   un’ampia zolla di terra.

   A questo proposito, è utile sapere anche che nelle zone con clima
   tropicale e subtropicale si può scegliere di piantare un albero in
   qualunque momento dell’anno. Questo è possibile perché in questi luoghi
   non esiste un periodo di riposo: le piante crescono sempre! L’importante è
   fornire all’albero una quantità sufficiente di acqua, in particolare
   durante la fase dell’attecchimento.

   In ogni caso, per non sbagliare, è meglio prediligere il periodo di riposo
   vegetativo (fine autunno e inverno) e la primavera, prima del
   germogliamento. In ogni eventualità non dimenticate che piantare un albero
   nel modo giusto vuol dire anche proteggerlo. Con gli shelter Tubex potrete
   andare sul sicuro!

    Frutticoltura: le protezioni per alberi da frutto da utilizzare durante
                              l’inverno e non solo

   13 Nov 2023 | Redazione Tubex |

   La frutticoltura è un’arte antica che richiede una cura costante e
   attenzione a ogni dettaglio, specialmente durante i rigidi mesi invernali.
   Uno dei metodi più efficaci per salvaguardare i fusti si concretizza
   nell’utilizzo delle protezioni per alberi da frutto proposte da Tubex. Con
   questi presupposti, oggi parliamo dell’importanza di proteggere queste
   piante durante l’inverno (e non solo) e di come gli shelter Tubex possono
   aiutare a raggiungere questo scopo.

L’importanza della protezione nei mesi più freddi

   Durante l’inverno, gli alberi da frutto sono particolarmente vulnerabili
   ad una serie di fattori avversi. Tra questi, primi fra tutti troviamo:

     * Basse temperature – Il gelo può danneggiare seriamente gli alberi,
       causando il congelamento del legno e delle radici.
     * Venti freddi – I venti invernali possono provocare la disidratazione
       delle piante: la corretta idratazione è essenziale per la crescita e
       la fruttificazione.
     * Animali selvatici – Gli animali selvatici, come i conigli, i caprioli
       e i topi, possono mordere e danneggiare la corteccia e i rami degli
       alberi.
     * Malattie e parassiti – Molti agenti patogeni e insetti dannosi sono
       ancora attivi durante i mesi invernali. Senza usare delle buone
       protezioni per alberi da frutto, agenti patogeni e insetti possono
       attaccare e danneggiare rami e tronchi.

   Proteggere gli alberi da frutto da tutti questi fattori può aiutare a
   prevenire danni significativi e garantire una produzione frutticola sana e
   abbondante.

   protezioni per alberi da frutto

    

Le protezioni per alberi da frutto a marchio Tubex: perfette in inverno e non
solo

   Gli shelter Tubex Fruitwrap si presentano come una soluzione affidabile e
   comprovata per chi necessita di proteggere gli alberi da frutto durante
   l’inverno. Queste protezioni tubolari flessibili agiscono come una
   barriera protettiva contro il freddo e i diversi agenti climatici,
   mantenendo una temperatura più elevata all’interno del tubo rispetto
   all’esterno. Aiutano a prevenire efficacemente i danni causati da animali,
   come roditori e conigli, e insetti dannosi, e anche a prevenire infezioni
   e malattie.

   Grazie alla struttura tubolare delle protezioni per alberi da frutto a
   marchio Tubex, gli alberi sono meno esposti alle raffiche di vento e al
   conseguente rischio di disidratazione. Inoltre, all’interno di questi
   shelter si crea un microclima umido in grado di favorire l’attecchimento e
   la crescita dei fusti.

Come utilizzare gli shelter Tubex

   Per utilizzare gli shelter Tubex in modo efficace, la prima cosa da fare è
   scegliere gli shelter delle dimensioni adatte ai propri alberi. Sarà
   importante assicurarsi che il tubo sia abbastanza alto da coprire una
   parte significativa dell’area inferiore del tronco. Grazie alla loro
   struttura avvolgibile, usare i Tubex Fruitwrap è molto semplice: basta
   avvolgere il tubo protettivo attorno al fusto e ancorarlo saldamente al
   suolo per ottenere benefici nel breve e nel lungo termine.

   Queste protezioni per alberi da frutto si dilatano autonomamente nel
   tempo, seguendo lo sviluppo della pianta. Quando non saranno più
   necessarie potranno essere tolte. Qualora cadessero e rimanessero sul
   terreno, non ci sarà da preoccuparsi: sono eco-friendly, e quindi in grado
   di degradarsi in modo naturale senza creare un impatto negativo nei
   confronti dell’ambiente.

           Protezione per alberi: ad ogni pianta il suo shelter Tubex

   20 Nov 2023 | Redazione Tubex |

   Ogni albero dovrebbe avere il suo shelter. Quest’ultimo è un vero e
   proprio rifugio: una protezione per alberi e piante che si rivela semplice
   da usare e, allo stesso tempo, all’avanguardia.

   Tubex propone varie soluzioni, e i suoi prodotti sono i più venduti in
   Italia. Gli shelter del marchio proteggono l’albero e ne favoriscono la
   crescita, rispettano l’ambiente e ottimizzano le attività di coloro che
   operano nel mondo dell’agricoltura, della paesaggistica e/o della
   silvicoltura. Detto questo, entriamo nel dettaglio e andiamo a vedere cosa
   offre Tubex.

Tubex Fruitwrap: la protezione per alberi da frutto

   Le protezioni Fruitwrap si presentano come shelter dalla struttura
   avvolgibile realizzati in polipropilene stabilizzato UV a doppia parete,
   un materiale sicuro per l’ambiente. Queste protezioni possono essere alte:

     * 0,4 metri
     * 0,6 metri
     * 0,75 metri
     * 0,9 metri

   Presentano un diametro di 65 millimetri, dilatabile fino a 80 millimetri
   (che si allargherà in relazione alla crescita dell’albero). Questa
   tipologia di protezione per alberi da frutto è di colore verde e protegge
   la pianta dagli attacchi degli animali, dalle sfavorevoli condizioni
   climatiche e ambientali, dagli impianti di manutenzione meccanizzata e
   molto altro.

   All’interno dello shelter si crea una sorta di microclima in grado di
   favorire l’attecchimento e la crescita dell’albero.

Per la vite c’è Tubex Ecovine

   Di certo la vite non è un albero, ma si tratta comunque di un vegetale
   particolare che necessita di una protezione altrettanto particolare. Con
   questi presupposti, oltre alla protezione per alberi disponibile in varie
   tipologie, Tubex propone Ecovine. Questo prodotto rappresenta una delle
   soluzioni più economiche ed efficaci per favorire l’attecchimento e la
   crescita della vite, proteggerla e permetterle di offrire un qualitativo e
   cospicuo raccolto.

   È stato riscontrato che questo tipo di shelter può anche aumentare
   considerevolmente la velocità di sviluppo della pianta. Questo avviene in
   particolare grazie all’umidità che viene intrappolata all’interno della
   protezione stessa e che regala importanti risorse al giovane arbusto.

   protezione per alberi

    

La protezione ventilata: Tubex Ventex

   Come dicevamo, per ogni albero esiste lo shelter più adatto. Dopo anni di
   osservazione e studio, Tubex ha creato anche le protezioni Ventex, ovvero
   degli shelter ventilati. Questi shelter sono muniti di un sistema di
   ventilazione brevettato che potenzia ancor più il microclima che si crea
   all’interno del tubo stesso. Usare questo tipo di protezione per alberi
   comporta una serie di vantaggi, tra cui:

     * Maggiore crescita della pianta – Si evince dal rapido ampliamento del
       diametro dello stelo e da un migliore sviluppo radicolare.
     * Aumento della biomassa totale – È stato riscontrato che con Ventex la
       biomassa totale della specie arborea o arbustiva può aumentare
       notevolmente. In alcune situazioni può diventare anche il doppio
       rispetto a quella delle piante non provviste di shelter.

   Quale stagione è il momento giusto per piantare alberi?

Come trovare il periodo giusto dell'anno

   Fondamentalmente, la primavera e l'autunno sono i periodi migliori
   dell'anno per piantare un albero. L'unico requisito è che il terreno sia
   protetto dal gelo.

     * È possibile piantare alberi anche quando c'è il gelo?
     * Tiefwurzler: quali alberi sono inclusi?

  Sistema di root

   Sono disponibili in commercio alberi con tre diversi tipi di radici, che
   hanno tutti un'influenza sul tempo di impianto.

     * Alberi a radice nuda: non hanno terreno alle radici
     * Alberi con zolla: sono stati scavati, la terra si aggrappa alle radici
       e la zolla è spesso avvolta con lino o rete metallica
     * Alberi in un contenitore: le piante sono cresciute in vaso fin
       dall'inizio

   Puoi praticamente piantare merci in container tutto l'anno, poiché questi
   alberi mettono radici e continuano a crescere. Gli alberi con una zolla,
   invece, dovrebbero idealmente essere piantati all'inizio dell'autunno (tra
   la fine di agosto e la fine di settembre) in modo che crescano in tempo
   utile prima dell'inverno. Le merci a radice nuda, invece, entrano nel
   terreno tra ottobre e aprile.

  Tipo di albero

   Oltre alla radice, decide anche il tipo di albero quando è meglio
   piantarlo. Gli alberi decidui vengono sempre piantati quando le foglie
   cadono in autunno in modo che possano investire le loro energie nella
   formazione di nuove radici. In primavera, d'altra parte, un albero del
   genere ha bisogno di troppa energia per cacciare nuove foglie. Puoi
   piantare alberi sempreverdi tutto l'anno, a seconda del tipo di radice.

  Suggerimenti

   Oltre alla stagione giusta, dovresti anche osservare le distanze di semina
   consigliate. Ciò riguarda anche le distanze regolamentate per legge dal
   confine di proprietà.

   Alberi da Frutti - Piantagione
   Scritto da: Vivai Piante Gabbianelli il 16/05/2019

Alberi da Frutti – Guida alla piantagione e manutenzione

  1. Perché piantare alberi da frutti

   Per chi ne ha la possibilità e lo spazio, piantare alberi da frutto è
   un’attività appassionante e appagante che non dovrebbe mai mancare nel
   nostro orto, giardino o terrazzo, grande o piccolo che sia.

   Realizzare un piccolo frutteto familiare è però anche un’attività delicata
   al tempo stesso che richiede un minimo di progettazione per evitare errori
   grossolani e successive frustrazioni nel caso di cattiva riuscita
   dell’impianto frutteto familiare.

  2. Come progettare un frutteto familiare

   Il frutteto familiare va progettato in funzione delle abitudini e delle
   esigenze della famiglia, nonché delle sue possibilità di lavoro, più che
   all’ottenimento di alte produzioni (che in buona parte andrebbero
   sprecate).

   Prima di proseguire nella scelta delle tipologie e varietà degli alberi da
   frutta da impiantare a dimora, è quindi essenziale conoscere i gusti della
   famiglia e le proprie abitudini. Ad esempio, se si ha la certezza negli
   anni che in un determinato periodo non è presente nessuno, inutile
   trapiantare alberi da frutta che maturino in quello specifico lasso di
   tempo.

   Inoltre, molto spesso si mettono a dimora dei tipi di alberi da frutto i
   cui frutti piacciono più a livello estetico che come caratteristiche
   gustative.

   In questi casi, buona parte dei frutti sono gettati, regalati, oppure
   nemmeno raccolti e lasciati marcire sulla pianta. (Peraltro, lasciare i
   frutti marci attaccati sull’albero da frutti è una pratica non
   raccomandabile poiché gli stessi fungono da serbatoio ed inoculo per le
   malattie che si potrebbero manifestare l’anno seguente).

   Nella fase successiva si predispone quindi un elenco alberi di frutta in
   base tenendo conto oltre che dei propri gusti personali anche delle
   caratteristiche di crescita delle varie specie e della loro epoca di
   maturazione.

   Riguardo al periodo di maturazione, è consigliabile scegliere varietà di
   alberi da frutto che abbiano una maturazione scalare nel tempo in modo da
   avere la produzione di frutta dalla primavera fino quasi all'inverno
   (tranne negli eventuali periodi di assenza dalla casa).

  Quando piantare alberi da frutto3. Quando piantare alberi da frutti

   La messa a dimora degli alberi da frutti va eseguita attuando alcune
   semplici ma fondamentali linee guida che consentiranno di dare una lunga e
   prospera vita agli alberi di frutto, poiché, l’albero frutta che cresce
   bene e sano nella fase iniziale, crea tutti i presupposti per resistere
   meglio agli agenti atmosferici, alle malattie e per regalarci abbondanti e
   costanti produzioni.

   Quando piantare albero con frutti: il migliore e giusto periodo per il
   trapianto alberi da frutto è da inizio autunno fino alla fine
   dell’inverno, quando gli alberi di frutto sono in riposo vegetativo e
   prive di foglie.

   Ci sono diversi vantaggi ad effettuare la messa a dimora alberi da frutto
   in questo lasso di tempo:

    1. L’attecchimento sarà più sicuro poiché il terreno con cui è stata
       richiusa la buca si compatterà bene attorno alle radici grazie alle
       piogge invernali.
    2. L’albero da frutto inizierà ad emettere la nuova vegetazione non
       appena la temperatura dell’aria ricomincerà ad aumentare alla fine
       dell’inverno e potrà esprimere il massimo potenziale di sviluppo
       consentito dalla sua capacità vegetativa.
    3. Se la stagione per piantare alberi di frutta è l’autunno, saranno
       necessari meno interventi di manutenzione, intesi soprattutto come
       annaffiature, poiché con le piantagioni autunno-invernali l’ albero di
       frutta affronterà la stagione estiva bene impossessata nel terreno,
       con le radici già ben sviluppate ed autonome nell’approvvigionamento
       idrico.

   Tutto ciò è essenzialmente valido per gli alberi da frutti forniti a
   radice nuda (radice scossa, cioè senza pane di terra).

   Per gli alberelli da vaso, che hanno l’apparato radicale già formato (e
   sono quindi più autonome), la messa a dimora degli alberi da frutti può
   essere eseguita per tutto l’arco dell’anno (anche se mettere a dimora gli
   alberi da vaso durante il periodo di riposo vegetativo è sempre
   preferibile).

   Ci sono poi alcuni tipi di alberi da frutta notoriamente delicati quali,
   ad esempio, olivo, kaki, fico e nespolo del Giappone, tropicali, esotiche
   che potrebbero essere danneggiate dal freddo invernale per cui, nei luoghi
   più freddi, è quasi tassativa la loro messa a dimora primaverile,
   indipendentemente dal fatto che siano alberi da frutto in vaso o a radice
   nuda (radice scossa, cioè senza pane di terra).

  Piantare alberi da frutto4. Dove piantare alberi da frutti

   In linea generale, tutte gli alberi da frutta amano una posizione
   soleggiata, luminosa, preferibilmente esposta a mezzogiorno e al riparo
   dalle correnti fredde settentrionali.

   Ci sono poi alcuni alberi frutto resistenti freddo come ad esempio il
   ciliegio, susino, melo, pero, pesco, sorbo, cotogno e nespolo europeo che
   non lo temono assolutamente e che si possono quindi collocare anche in
   posizioni meno favorevoli. Altre specie invece, quali albicocco, mandorlo
   e nespolo del Giappone, temono i ritorni di freddo tardivi che possono
   provocare danni ai fiori ed anche ai nuovi germogli se il freddo è molto
   intenso.

   Il tipo di terreno è un fattore determinante che può decretare il successo
   o l’insuccesso della piantagione degli alberi in vaso da frutti.

   Generalmente sono da preferire quei suoli di medio impasto, ricchi di
   sostanza organica e ben drenati. Sono sicuramente da evitare quelli molto
   argillosi, compatti ed asfittici.

   Nella scelta del sesto di impianto, cioè lo schema di piantagione, un
   altro fattore fondamentale da tenere in considerazione è lo spazio aereo e
   radicale che andrà ad occupare l’albero da frutta una volta adulto.
   Riguardo quindi alla distanza tra alberi da frutto, gli schemi per mettere
   a dimora gli alberi da frutta possono essere schematicamente riassunti nei
   seguenti quattro:

    1. a file.
    2. a file sfalsate.
    3. a quadrato (posizionando gli alberi da frutti ai quattro angoli).
    4. a quinconce (posizionando gli alberi da frutti a quadrato ed una al
       centro).

   Qualunque sia il sesto di impianto scelto, in linea del tutto generale, si
   consiglia di prevedere distanze relative tra gli alberi di frutto di circa
   4/6 metri, variabili in funzione della vigoria della pianta, esposizione e
   pendenza del terreno.

   Attenzione a rispettare distanze di almeno 2/3 metri da recinzioni,
   muretti e pavimentazioni e di almeno 6/7 metri da altri alberi esistenti
   ed edifici.

   Gli alberi da frutta nani possono essere messe a dimora a distanze più
   ridotte in quanto il loro sviluppo sarà molto più contenuto.
   Indicativamente si consigliano distanze tra gli alberi di 2/3 metri.

   Infine, riguardo alle distanze dai confini, attenersi sempre alle distanze
   minime previste dalla legge o dai regolamenti locali.

  Come piantare alberi da frutto5. Come piantare alberi da frutti

   Definito il tipo di terreno, si deve procedere con la preparazione delle
   buche delle seguenti dimensioni (indicative): larghezza 80/100 cm. e
   profondità 60/80 cm.

   Questa operazione deve essere eseguita diverso tempo prima della messa a
   dimora degli alberi da frutta in vaso, preferibilmente durante l’estate in
   modo da arieggiare il suolo e lasciarlo successivamente esposto agli
   agenti atmosferici invernali che lo renderanno friabile e poroso.

   Se nel terreno ci fossero stati presenti in precedenza altri alberi da
   frutta, si consiglia di spolverare tutte le pareti della buca con calce
   viva per distruggere eventuali funghi derivanti dai vecchi apparati
   radicali.

   Qualora il terreno si presenti argilloso e compatto, sarà indispensabile
   collocare sul fondo della buca uno strato di circa 10/15 cm di sassi o
   ciottoli al fine di favorire il drenaggio delle acque. E’ inoltre
   consigliabile apportare, sempre sul fondo della buca, anche uno strato di
   letame maturo (qualora disponibile) oppure del compost maturo andrà bene
   lo stesso.

   L'albero frutti deve essere posizionata con il suo pane di terra nel
   terreno ad un’altezza tale che il colletto (zona di passaggio fra il fusto
   e l’apparato radicale) sia di qualche centimetro al di sopra del piano di
   campagna; ciò è molto importante in quanto una profondità eccessiva
   potrebbe provocare asfissia alle radici mentre un interramento troppo
   superficiale lascerebbe le radici esposte all’aria.

   La buca può essere quindi richiusa con il terreno di scavo, qualora sia
   friabile e bene sminuzzato, in modo da accostarsi perfettamente
   all’apparato radicale, evitando quindi la pericolosa formazione di sacche
   d’aria o acqua.

   Questo è un passaggio determinante ed importantissimo per la riuscita
   della piantagione; qualora il terreno presente in loco non sia idoneo
   (grosse zolle non frantumabili, molta ghiaia, etc...), è opportuno
   apportarne di migliore oppure miscelarlo (prima di usarlo per chiudere la
   buca) con terriccio universale o sabbia.

   Schema di come trapiantare alberi da fruttoDi fianco all’albero da frutto,
   nel lato opposto alla direzione del vento dominante, andrà posizionato un
   paletto tutore in legno scortecciato di pino o canna di bamboo' che avrà
   il compito di sorreggere il fusto in presenza di vento, evitando quindi
   che venga sradicato e che cresca storto.

   Solitamente l’altezza del tutore deve essere pari al punto in cui inizierà
   ad aprirsi la chioma della pianta. Nella scelta dei materiali di legatura
   è importante optare per legacci in pvc morbido o in juta, resistenti ma
   svenevoli al tempo stesso in modo da evitare strozzature al fusto durante
   l’accrescimento.

   In alternativa, in commercio si trovano dei fermagli elastici dotati anche
   di distanziatore, utilissimo per evitare che la corteccia e il tutore
   sfreghino tra di loro danneggiando la corteccia dell’albero da frutto. Si
   consiglia inoltre di controllare periodicamente la legatura per
   verificarne la tenuta ed evitare strozzature.

   Qualora non si sia apportato letame in fondo alla buca, sarà necessaria
   una leggera concimazione piante da frutto superficiale con circa 1-2 kg.
   di concime per frutteto contenente azoto organico a lenta cessione (tipo
   stallatico) in modo che il nutrimento sia via via disponibile all’albero
   per tutta la stagione vegetativa.

   Ultima operazione è eseguire un’abbondante annaffiatura con circa 50/80
   litri d’acqua avente lo scopo di fare accostare bene il terreno alle
   radici.

  Piantare alberi da frutto6. Cure colturali alberi da frutti

   Dopo la messa a dimora degli alberi da frutti, il lavoro non è finito, ma
   anzi incomincia. Per avere degli alberi da frutta sani infatti necessarie
   tutta una serie di operazioni colturali che si devono ripetere
   ciclicamente e regolarmente ogni anno.

  Piantare alberi da frutto7. Come potare alberi da frutti

   Una volta completata la messa a dimora dell’albero da frutto, si passa ad
   eseguire la potatura “di formazione” (detta anche “di allevamento”) che
   verrà poi proseguita solamente per i primi 3/4 anni. Essa si prefigge
   diversi ed importanti obiettivi:

    1. Formare lo scheletro dell'albero di frutta della dimensione desiderata
       che supporti la produzione ma assecondando comunque il suo naturale
       portamento.
    2. Veloce raggiungimento della fase di maturità, cioè della piena
       fruttificazione.
    3. Permettere l’esecuzione da terra delle operazioni di potatura alberi
       da frutti e raccolta.
    4. Agevolare la meccanizzazione delle cure colturali.

   Si possono generalmente distinguere due tipologie di allevamento: forme
   “in volume” e forme “appiattite”.

   Classica forma in volume è il vaso, la più usata e conosciuta per i
   piccoli frutteti a carattere familiare, che presenta tre o quattro branche
   principali inserite ad una certa altezza del tronco in una unica
   impalcatura. L’obiettivo generale è cercare di mantenere vuota la parte
   centrale dell’albero di frutta togliendo i cosiddetti “succhioni” (rami
   verticali non produttivi), cercando di dare una forma sempre più verso
   l’esterno ai rimanenti ed avendo cura di lasciare i rametti piccoli che
   hanno gemme a fiore, gonfie e arrotondante. È sempre buona norma eliminare
   anche i rami che si intersecano tra loro e quelli che ombreggiano il
   tronco. Eliminare, infine, i rami spezzati a causa di traumi o gelate e i
   rami rovinati dalle malattie. Se il ramo tagliato o asportato è di grandi
   dimensioni, è opportuno proteggere la superficie del taglio con una pasta
   cicatrizzante.

   La palmetta è invece un esempio di forma appiattita dove tutte le branche
   principali sono orientate su di un unico verticale in modo da limitare lo
   sviluppo laterale della chioma.

   L’operazione si distingue a seconda della fase di sviluppo dell’albero da
   frutta (potatura di allevamento o formazione e di mantenimento o
   produzione) e della stagione in cui si eseguono (potatura secca o
   invernale e potatura verde o estiva).

   La potatura degli alberi da frutto è una delle azioni ritenute più
   difficili dai giardinieri e frutticoltori amatoriali poiché richiedono una
   minima conoscenza di botanica e fisiologia per governare l’andamento della
   crescita e della fruttificazione.

   Gli interventi di taglio su un fruttifero sono necessari fondamentalmente
   per tre motivi:

    1. Ottenere alberi da frutti di forma armoniosa ed equilibrata.
    2. Migliorare qualità e quantità dei frutti
    3. Mantenere gli esemplari coltivati in vigore e in salute

   Nella potatura di formazione, durante i primi anni dopo la messa a dimora
   si interviene per dare all’albero da frutto la forma prescelta e
   consentire alle ramificazioni di sopportare il carico della
   fruttificazione.

   La scelta della forma di allevamento dipende sia dalle preferenze
   personali sia dalla specie e varietà, nonché da clima ed esposizione.

   Il frutticoltore può scegliere se governare la crescita di tronco e rami
   con forme obbligate (spalliere, filari, tunnel), grazie all’impiego di
   fili e tutori, o se preferire la crescita delle piante con tronco basso e
   chioma allargata (forme in volume): esistono moltissime possibilità di
   conduzione della chioma, alcune usate a scopi più che altro estetici,
   altre che rispondono invece a esigenze di coltivazione.

   All’interno di un giardino o per il frutteto famigliare le forme in volume
   naturali o a vaso sono quelle consigliabili perché di facile manutenzione,
   e spesso l’esemplare acquistato nei vivai piante da frutto è già
   preimpostato in questa direzione.

   Nella potatura invernale a fine inverno si effettuano tagli per eliminare
   i rami secchi o esili e fragili, nonché quelli folti e incrociati fra
   loro, e per ridurre la chioma al fine di mantenerla ben aerata.

   Con la potatura si incoraggia poi la nascita di nuovi germogli: la
   conoscenza di questo meccanismo è importante perché, attraverso opportuni
   interventi, sarà possibile stimolare la formazione di gemme da frutto,
   ottimizzando la produzione, e favorire lo sviluppo di nuove branche, per
   colmare vuoti e sostituire parti malate.

   Infine, nella potatura estiva si intervenire sui fruttiferi durante la
   stagione vegetativa (quando è più facile individuare le gemme e, quindi,
   effettuare il taglio in modo corretto), con gli stessi obbiettivi della
   potatura invernale.

   Vengono poi considerati interventi di potatura estiva anche la
   spollonatura (eliminazione dei polloni che crescono alla base dell’albero
   di frutta e che sottraggono nutrimento alla chioma) e la sfemminellatura
   (eliminazione dei getti verticali che spuntano su tronco e ramificazioni
   principali).

   Vi rientrano anche piegatura, inclinazione e curvatura dei rami, tecniche
   particolari con cui si inducono alla fioritura rami altrimenti vocati alla
   sola produzione delle foglie. Sempre in estate si pratica, quando
   necessario, il diradamento dei frutti: si asportano cioè i frutticini più
   piccoli e mal posizionati per aumentare qualità e pezzatura di quelli che
   rimangono. L’intervento interessa soprattutto albicocchi, peri e susini.

   Albicocchi, ciliegi, cotogni e fichi si potano più che altro per mantenere
   la chioma pulita, sana e ordinata, in quanto si tratta di fruttiferi che
   reagiscono poco alla potatura e il loro legno si cicatrizza con minore
   rapidità.

   Le specie sensibili alla potatura (come i meli, i peri e tutte le altre
   alberi di frutti che appartengono alla famiglia delle pomacee) non possono
   fare a meno di tagli regolari perché la produzione di lamburde e brindilli
   (cioè i rami destinati a portare frutti) dipende dal corretto regime di
   accorciamento dei rami.

   I susini e i peschi danno il raccolto migliore se vengono potati
   regolarmente, soprattutto se allevati a spalliera.

   Nei fruttiferi ogni gemma nascente può essere destinata a diventare una
   gemma a legno, a fiore oppure mista: le prime hanno forma appuntita e
   daranno luogo a ramoscelli esclusivamente da foglia; le seconde sono
   invece tozze, tondeggianti, più grosse delle gemme a legno e svilupperanno
   ramoscelli con foglie e fiori (e quindi frutti); le miste, infine, hanno
   forma intermedia fra i due tipi sopra descritti e possono produrre rami
   sia a fiore sia a legno.

   Durante la potatura occorre salvaguardare le gemme a fiore, che su meli e
   peri crescono su tre tipi di ramificazioni diverse: sui rami misti che,
   più o meno lunghi, si sviluppano ogni anno in modo uniforme in tutta la
   chioma, e che portano gemme sia a fiore sia a frutto.

   Gemme a fiore spuntano anche sulla punta dei brindilli, rametti corti (max
   30 cm), esili e molto flessibili che su tutta la lunghezza portano solo
   gemme a legno: con lo sviluppo dei frutti i rami si incurvano assumendo
   una conformazione caratteristica.

   Le lamburde, infine, sono rametti corti, d’aspetto deformato: nei primi 3
   anni di sviluppo generano solo gemme a legno che formano una
   caratteristica coroncina di foglie, solo poi la gemma in punta diviene
   mista e inizia a produrre anche fiori.

   In quest’ultima fase la lamburda si ingrossa e viene chiamata “borsa”; nel
   melo spesso si ha lo sviluppo di più lamburde ravvicinate tra loro e la
   formazione prende il nome di “zampa di pollo”.

   Attrezzatura occorrente per la potatura degli alberi da frutti:

    1. Un paio di cesoie robuste e perfettamente affilate, adatte alla mano
       del potatore (esistono anche tipologie per mancini),
    2. Un troncarami, attrezzo che può essere dotato di manici a V più o meno
       lunghi; alcuni modelli hanno un meccanismo a moltiplica, che migliora
       sensibilmente la prestazione di taglio in rapporto allo sforzo
       necessario, altri manico a stantuffo, che muove le lame all’estremità.
       Chi ha molte alberi di frutto può ricorrere ai comodi attrezzi da
       taglio pneumatici, che riducono molto l’affaticamento della mano.
    3. Un seghetto ben affilato (o una motosega) è poi utile per rimuovere
       rami di grossa dimensione.

   Il taglio, qualunque sia la sua larghezza, deve essere inclinato per far
   scorrere via le gocce d’acqua. Se interessa una superficie ampia, conviene
   trattare la parte con apposito mastice cicatrizzante.

   Infine è buona prassi pulire e disinfettare con alcool le lame degli
   attrezzi da taglio prima di passare da un esemplare all’altro, per
   limitare la propagazione di problemi fitosanitari.

  Piantare alberi da frutto8. Trattamento alberi da frutti

   Alla caduta delle foglie è importante eseguire una corretta difesa
   fitosanitaria intervenendo con prodotti rameici (poltiglia bordolese),
   utili per cicatrizzare ferite, cancri rameali e gommosi e prevenire
   eventuali infezioni fungine primaverili.

   Un secondo intervento, della stessa tipologia, si renderà necessario
   durante l’inverno dopo avere eseguito la potatura alberi da frutta od in
   presenza di alberi da frutta con rami danneggiati dalla neve o dopo
   periodi particolarmente piovosi.

   Prima della fioritura, nella fase di bottoni rosa (gemme a fiore
   ingrossate), si consiglia un altro intervento con poltiglia bordolese,
   associata ad un insetticida in modo da prevenire numerose malattie, sia
   fungine che da insetti.

   ATTENZIONE: in questo caso si consiglia di verificare attentamente in
   etichetta la compatibilità dell'insetticida con la bordolese poiché non
   tutti sono compatibili.

   Si consiglia di operare sempre in giornate di sole, in assenza di vento e
   con scarsa probabilità di pioggia; qualora dovesse poi piovere dopo sole
   poche ore dall’intervento, è necessario ripetere il trattamento alberi da
   frutta.

   Mentre gli interventi “al bruno”, compiuti cioè durante il riposo
   vegetativo dell’albero da frutto, si possono ritenere validi un po’ per
   tutte le specie, pomacee e drupacee, sui trattamenti tardo-primaverili ed
   estivi, è impossibile fornire delle linee guida generali in quanto ogni
   specie ha i suoi patogeni specifici ed epoche e modalità di intervento
   differenti.

  Piantare alberi da frutto9. Concimazione alberi da frutti

   Per la concimazione alberi da frutto a carattere familiare è sempre
   conveniente apportare letame ben maturo, concime organico azotato che
   migliora la struttura del terreno e consente di nutrire le piante in modo
   naturale e per tutta la stagione vegetativa; in assenza di letame, si può
   utilizzare come concime organico il pellettato bovino (stallatico).

   L’epoca ideale di concimazione degli alberi in vaso da frutto è durante
   tutto l’inverno e comunque prima della ripresa vegetativa poiché l’azoto
   organico ivi contenuto, ha bisogno di diverso tempo e trasformazioni prima
   di essere disponibile ad essere assorbito dalla pianta.

   In presenza di piante di scarsa vigoria, terreni poveri, primavere molto
   piovose, si consiglia una seconda concimazione alberi da frutti, ad
   aprile-maggio, con concime misto organico-minerale, a più pronto effetto,
   col il quale si apporta oltre all’azoto anche fosforo, potassio ed altri
   microelementi.

   Il concime per alberi da frutto resistenti va distribuito superficialmente
   attorno al tronco su una superficie corrispondente alla proiezione della
   chioma sul terreno, avendo cura di spargerlo in modo uniforme e di
   interrarlo leggermente nel terreno con una leggera zappettatura. Le dosi
   variano caso per caso in funzione dell’età e mole dell’albero da frutta e
   del titolo del concime per cui non possono essere schematizzate e si
   consiglia di attenersi alle indicazione proposte nella confezione.

   Qualora il terreno si presenti compatto, prima di distribuire il concime,
   si consiglia di eseguire una leggera sarchiatura, utile anche alla
   rimozione delle malerbe e successivamente procedere ad una leggera
   innaffiatura, tutto ciò al fine di favorire l’accorpamento del concime nel
   terreno.

  Piantare alberi da frutto10. Irrigazione agli alberi da frutto

   Durante il periodo estivo spesso ci si gioca la sorte degli alberi di
   frutta. È difatti fondamentale, soprattutto durante i primi anni di
   sviluppo dell’albero da frutto, essere metodici nel monitorare
   costantemente sul campo lo stato idrico dell’albero di frutta ed
   intervenire con adeguati interventi di irrigazione di soccorso.

   In linea del tutto generale, in assenza di piogge di una certa
   consistenza, si consiglia di intervenire ogni 10/15 giorni circa con
   almeno 50/100 litri per ogni albero da frutto.

   Questa, ribadiamo, è solo un’indicazione molto di massima in quanto nel
   fabbisogno idrico di un alberello di frutta concorrono tanti fattori, per
   esempio, tanto per citarne alcuni: tipo di albero da frutto, tipo di
   terreno, temperatura, stadio vegetativo, etc... Solo lo spirito di
   osservazione, l’esperienza acquisita sul campo e un po' di buon senso,
   saranno in grado di indirizzarci verso una corretta gestione.

   In associazione all’irrigazione sono importantissime anche adeguate
   sarchiature (zappature) con le quali si ottengono tre importanti
   obiettivi:

    1. Tenere pulito dalle malerbe il terreno ed evitare quindi la loro
       competizione.
    2. Interrompere il flusso di risalita dell’acqua per capillarità con
       conseguente evaporazione, riducendo quindi il fabbisogno idrico.
    3. Facilitare l’assorbimento dell’acqua di irrigazione e ridurne gli
       sprechi per scorrimento, problema in particolare sentito nei terreni
       acclivi e argillosi che tendono a formare una crosta impermeabile. A
       tal proposito si consiglia di formare sempre attorno all'albero da
       frutto, con il terreno circostante, la cosiddetta “tazza”, cioè una
       sorta di bacino capace di contenere una buona quantità di acqua.

   Se si possiede un piccolo impianto frutteto organizzato in filari e si
   opta per la sarchiatura a pieno campo, è importante ricordare che le
   lavorazioni del terreno devono essere superficiali (10/15 cm) per evitare
   danneggiamenti agli apparati radicali degli alberi da frutta.

   Qualora si decidesse invece per la tecnica dell’inerbimento, si consiglia
   di seminare tra le file delle foraggere leguminose (come ad esempio il
   trifoglio) o appositi miscugli, che non sottraggono elementi nutritivi
   all’albero ma anzi, favoriscono la fissazione di azoto atmosferico nel
   terreno, migliorandolo nettamente e contrastando l’insediamento delle erbe
   infestanti.

   Anche scegliendo questa tecnica sarà comunque necessario mantenere, almeno
   per i primi 3/4 anni, attorno all’albero da frutto un’area di terreno
   zappettata e libera da malerbe.

   In alternativa si può ricorrere alla posa, attorno al tronco dell’albero
   da frutto, di dischi di pacciamatura biodegradabili in juta e fibra di
   cocco che, oltre a contenere l’infestazione delle malerbe, trattengono
   l’umidità e assicurano un’efficace barriera all’evaporazione dell’acqua.

  Piantare alberi da frutto11. Raccolta della frutta e conservazione

   Un accorgimento molto importante, spesso tralasciato o semplicemente
   sconosciuto, è il diradamento dei frutticini in maturazione. Se l’albero
   da frutto è molto carico di frutti, si corre il rischio di ottenere una
   ridotta pezzatura, una scarsa colorazione dell’epidermide e uno scadente
   sapore dei frutti.

   Dopo la cascola fisiologica, si esegue quindi il diradamento manuale
   cercando di lasciare sui rametti i frutti distanziati di circa 10/15 cm;
   in questo modo si ottengono frutti di pezzatura maggiore e dal gusto più
   saporito.

   Il periodo ottimale per la raccolta della frutta dipende dalla varietà e
   dalla destinazione d’uso del prodotto. La frutta che matura in piena
   estate deve essere raccolta pochi giorni prima della maturazione mentre,
   all’opposto, le varietà invernali devono essere raccolte il più
   tardivamente possibile per avere dei frutti più maturi e di maggiore
   pezzatura.

   È buona norma raccogliere durante delle belle giornate, senza vento o
   pioggia. I frutti devono essere staccati asciutti con il loro picciolo e
   riposti in cesti o panieri imbottiti, avendo cura di non ammaccarli.
   Durante le operazioni di raccolta è inoltre molto importante non
   danneggiare i rametti che portano i frutti. Ci sono infatti delle specie
   quali, ad esempio, il ciliegio, il melo ed il pero che fruttificano anche
   su dei delicati rametti di diversi anni (mazzetti di maggio e lamburde);
   romperli vorrebbe dire perdere parte della produzione per alcuni anni.

   La frutta si conserva bene in ambienti freschi, arieggiati e senza troppa
   umidità, facendo attenzione, durante i mesi invernali, ad eseguire
   controlli e cernite volte a togliere i frutti eventualmente marci.

  ”Piantare12. Problemi degli alberi da frutto

   Tra i numerosi problemi che affliggono gli alberi da frutti, uno dei più
   lamentati è la mancanza di fruttificazione.

   Se l’albero da frutto non fruttifica, ci possono essere tanti motivi ma i
   più comuni sono:

    1. L’albero frutto è ancora in fase di giovanilità e non è entrato in
       produzione.
    2. L’albero di frutta è vecchio, è in fase di senescenza e sta terminando
       il suo ciclo vitale.
    3. In alcune specie (per esempio ciliegio e susino) ci sono delle varietà
       “autosterili” per cui in assenza di idonea cultivar impollinatrice, la
       fruttificazione sarà molto ridotta o nulla.
    4. Spesso le gelate tardive possono danneggiare i fiori, i frutticini e
       tenere lontani gli insetti pronubi.
    5. L'albero da frutta presenta sviluppo stentato ed ingiallimenti, segno
       evidente di poche o errate concimazioni, soprattutto nei terreni
       poveri.
    6. Con interventi di potatura sugli alberi da frutti sbagliati si
       eliminano i rami a frutto oppure, se troppo drastiche, si ottiene un
       forte sviluppo vegetativo a discapito della fruttificazione.
    7. Un eccesso di concimazione azotata, spesso associata a potature
       eccessive, provoca una forte vigoria, emissione di succhioni e di
       polloni, il tutto a discapito della differenziazione di gemme a fiore.

   Un altro problema, spesso ricorrente, è il mancato attecchimento o scarso
   sviluppo degli alberi da frutti dovuto a diversi errori tra i quali i più
   comuni sono:

    1. Realizzazione di buche troppo strette e/o poco profonde, soprattutto
       in presenza di terreni argillosi, compatti e on drenanti.
    2. Messa a dimora alberi da frutti a eccessiva profondità.
    3. Distribuzione di concimi chimici a diretto contatto con le radici,
       provocando ustioni a queste ultime.
    4. Scarse o assenti cure colturali, soprattutto nei primi anni di vita
       (trattamenti fitosanitari, irrigazioni, potature e concimazioni).

          Ho un centinaio di piante da frutto un po' di tutte le varietà.
          L'impianto risale al 1996. Ormai da qualche anno la produzione è
          progressivamente in calo. E' possibile che un frutteto di 25 anni
          abbia già concluso il suo ciclo produttivo?

                       Gli alberi, il cinema e La Trinità

   da copy/ufficio comunicazione | 11 Dic 2023 | a come alberi

    Quei giorni in cui Nanni Moretti girò a La Trinità…

   Cominciamo da un gioco (o quasi). Parecchi anni fa – per l’esattezza nel
   1974 – Nanni Moretti venne a La Trinità, se ne innamorò e… Ciak! Fece un
   mediometraggio girato in super 8, proprio dentro e attorno all’antico
   casale. Protagonisti non secondari, dunque, anche i nostri alberi.

     Si tratta di una parodia de I promessi sposi, che – se vuoi – puoi
     cercare anche nelle Teche RAI. E il titolo è Come parli frate? Lui,
     Nanni Moretti, vi recita la parte di un Don Rodrigo:  spiritosamente
     ‘riveduto e corretto’. In 52 minuti la commedia rovescia stereotipi e fa
     sorridere, partendo dal passo del VI capitolo del romanzo, dove uno
     sprezzante Don Rodrigo apostrofa appunto Fra Cristoforo.

   Di sicuro ricordano bene quelle riprese tutti gli interpreti del film
   liberamente ispirato a Manzoni. Anzi, siamo certi che Lucia (Lorenza
   Codignola), Fra Cristoforo (Vincenzo Vitobello), Renzo (Giorgio Viterbo),
   Agnese (Fulvia Fazio), il Conte Zio (Beniamino Placido), il Padre
   Provinciale (Corrado Sannucci), il nobile (Fabio Traversa), i Bravi
   (Luciano Agati, Fabio Sposini e Igor Skofic), Don Abbondio (Pietro
   Veronese)… Siamo certi che tutti loro serbano nella memoria dei momenti
   indimenticabili e dei chiari ‘fermo immagine’ del nostro giardino di
   campagna. Sarebbe bello, in effetti, riportarli tutti a La Trinità…

   Magari prossimamente ci aiuterà ad attuare questo piano di amarcord
   Stefano Lariccia, che pure nel film di Moretti recita nel ruolo del Griso.
   Chissà… Pensiamo che se ne possa riparlare presto, proprio con lui. Qui
   sul blog e non solo (!).

     Intanto… Intanto è quasi Natale, cioè appunto (anche) tempo di cinema. E
     con queste premesse ci pare di dire bene se osserviamo che non può
     essere soltanto tempo di cine-panettoni. Al contrario possiamo
     immaginare con te di ritagliare in questi giorni delle ore per guardare
     qualche cult-movie: sul divano, pop-corn o meglio ancora noccioline
     dolci in mano. Buona idea, no?

   Così, tra nuove e vecchie serie, proviamo a fare un nuovo gioco? Possiamo
   trovare storie di alberi e tra gli alberi. Un gioco per celebrare il
   paesaggio ricordando anche quel primo ciak avvenuto a La Trinità. In
   attesa – perché no?! – di accogliere tra i nostri alberi altri registi,
   attori, comparse, persone appassionate di verde e di racconti 🎬

     ‘Si gira’, allora. Cominciamo una piccola carrellata di film che parlano
     di alberi. Rigorosamente dai più recenti ai più lontani nel tempo. Come
     salendo su una macchina del tempo.

      2022 - I sogni abitano gli alberi - regia di Marco Della Fonte

   La pellicola racconta la storia di una presunta malata mentale: Anja, la
   quale – dopo aver trascorso gli ultimi cinque anni della sua vita in un
   ospedale psichiatrico – fa ritorno a casa del fratello Ettore e di sua
   cognata Lisa. I due vivono in un paesino dell’Appenino toscano. Qui
   l’inserimento per la ragazza è duro: tutti la etichettano, tranne Libero
   che non ha pregiudizi e che finisce per innamorarsene. Giudicati folli da
   tutti, i due amanti si nasconderanno alla fine tra gli alberi del bosco…

      2014 - Alberi che camminano - regia di Erri de Luca

   Questo film-documentario ci è piaciuto tantissimo: anche gli alberi del
   Vivaio Gigante dei nostri avi, del resto, erano un po’ alberi in cammino.
   Che ne pensi? Comunque, il racconto di Erri De Luca osserva e ricorda i
   viaggi di un albero. Sì, insomma, si parla di seconde vite delle piante:
   alberi diventati navi oppure strumenti musicali, croci sulle vette delle
   montagne o sculture. Tra le storie raccontate, quella di Mauro Corona che
   ti porta a spasso tra gli alberi cresciuti sulla frana del Vajont.
   Presentato in anteprima mondiale durante la 55esima Edizione Festival dei
   Popoli di Firenze.

     N.B. A proposito di Vajont anche noi avremmo da raccontarne una, che
     riguarda una famosa Sequoia sopravvissuta alla tragedia. Portata lì da
     un altro nostro antenato, te ne racconteremo magari le ‘gesta’ in un
     prossimo articolo… Tu continua a leggerci (!).

      2013 - Alberi - regia di Michelangelo Frammartino

   Qualcuno ha definito questo film una cine-istallazione. Il regista vi
   gioca dentro usando il concetto di tempo per dare vita a un ciclo
   infinito. Possiamo definirlo un percorso alla scoperta dei culti più
   antichi, quando i romiti si ricoprivano di edera fino a diventare
   irriconoscibili: fino a divenire uomini-albero. Un cammino tra Pungitopo e
   Ginestre, alla ricerca di carità e verità nascoste. Molto interessante per
   chi ama la profondità delle cose.

      2012 - Il segreto degli alberi - regia di Alessandro Toffanelli

   Il panorama è quello del Parco Migliarino San Rossore. E dunque vi trovi
   Pini, Querce, Lecci, Eucalipti. Accanto a loro, c’è Giovanni che ha appena
   ereditato una baracca nel cuore di quel polmone verde. In realtà, per lui
   non è propriamente ‘una passeggiata’ stare in quel luogo: lì infatti,
   molti anni prima, si è tolto la vita il padre. In qualche modo però
   Giovanni vuole riconciliarsi con la memoria e quindi con lo stesso bosco,
   così pieno di mistero, di storie che riemergono dal passato.

      2011 - The Tree Of Life - regia di Terrence Malick

   Sono gli anni Cinquanta e siamo negli Stati Uniti. Inizialmente il film
   sembra raccontare la storia di una famiglia del ceto medio: un padre
   dispotico, una madre che fa da eterna mediatrice e i tre figli. Ma non ci
   sono solo gli O’Brien a tessere la trama. C’è anche una gigantesca
   Quercia, che dal giardino osserva e racchiude il senso del tempo. Un tempo
   che va ben oltre quello dei protagonisti umani…

      2002 - Harry Potter e la camera dei segreti - regia di Chris Joseph
      Columbus

   Anche J. K. Rowling, autrice della saga di Harry Potter, ha lasciato
   entrare molta natura nella sua opera fantasy. Ci sono così mostri e
   creature inverosimili, ma anche alberi. In particolare, non ti sarai mica
   dimentica/o del Platano picchiatore! Altre piante ad alto fusto nominate
   dalla Rowling e immortalate dal regista Columbus sono d’altronde placide e
   bonarie. Forse non hanno covato in sé tanta rabbia e risentimento come il
   vecchio Platano piazzato nel cortile di Hogwarts (?).

      2002 - Il Signore degli Anelli: Le due torri - regia di Peter Jackson
      (2002)

   Barbarlbero – un albero antropomorfizzatdo e detto anche il Pastore degli
   alberi – compare nel secondo capitolo della trilogia di John Ronald Reuel
   Tolkien. Spicca così tra hobbit ed elfi, orchi e draghi. Ed ha un ruolo
   decisivo nella sconfitta di Saruman. Ovviamente anche nel film.

      1995 - Pocahontas - regia di Mike Gabriel e Eric Goldberg

   Alberi partecipano alle avventure di Biancaneve e Cenerentola, del Re
   Leone e appunto di Pocahontas. Alberi sono per lo più sempre presenti e
   determinanti in tutte le storie della Disney. Così anche nel film basato
   sulla storia del personaggio di Pocahontas Rolfe trovi Nonna Salice: un
   albero animato, vecchio e nocchiuto e saggio. “Ascolta il tuo cuore”,
   consiglia sempre alla giovane nativa americana (realmente esistita nel
   Seicento). E lei perciò si affida volentieri alla sua verde saggezza.

     N.B. Ti suggeriamo la lettura di un libro di David Whitley, professore
     dell’Università di Cambridge, che ha scritto appunto su The Idea of
     Nature in Disney Animation. Senz’altro dal 1937 agli anni Duemila alcune
     cose sono cambiate, quindi si è passati da una visione idilliaca degli
     scenari naturali a una presa di coscienza dell’aggressività e della
     brutalità dell’uomo nei confronti del mondo animale e vegetale. Va
     dunque dato il merito alla Disney – secondo Whitley – di aver
     addirittura ispirato i primi movimenti ambientalisti degli anni ’60 e
     ’70. Poi si è ancora passati a un rapporto più profondo e simbiotico col
     creato (Il Libro della Giungla, Alla ricerca di Nemo, etc). Per questo
     il professore americano sostiene che i cartoni della Disney possono
     essere considerati un punto fermo nell’educazione ambientale dei
     ragazzi. Peccato, aggiungiamo noi e altre voci un po’ critiche, che la
     Disney si sia curata poco della deforestazione a causa della costruzione
     dei suoi giganteschi parchi dei divertimenti. Ma questa è – in qualche
     modo – un’altra storia…

      1993 - Il segreto del Bosco vecchio - regia di Ermanno Olmi

   Anche questo film deriva da una lettura delicata ed ecologica: il racconto
   animista del grande Dino Buzzati che porta lo stesso titolo. La storia
   trova in Olmi un narratore per immagini eccezionale, che sa dare voce a
   tutti i personaggi della favola: agli animali, alle ombre, persino ai
   venti. Il colonnello Sebastiano Procolo ha ereditato dallo zio parte delle
   sue tenute, appunto il Bosco vecchio. Ma egli non si accontenta: vorrebbe
   impossessarsi anche dell’altra parte della proprietà, andata invece al
   giovane nipote Sebastiano. Il colonnello farebbe di tutto per diventare
   padrone dell’intera zona e per ‘mettere a frutto’ ogni ettaro, abbattendo
   tutti gli alberi di cui in effetti non vede il valore. Ma il Bosco
   intuisce il pericolo. Così custodi degli alberi e geni magici entrano in
   gioco, trasformandosi in animali o addirittura in uomini. Un’azione di
   difesa fantastica (!).

      1988 - Gorilla nella nebbia - regia di Michael Apted

   Le prime protagoniste di questo importante film sono le foreste del
   Ruanda. Lì si muovono i gorilla di montagna del Volcanoes National Park e
   la zoologa Dian Fossey, che dagli USA è partita proprio per studiarli. Una
   storia vera di una donna temeraria e appassionata, che dedicò 18 anni
   della sua via a lottare i bracconieri e a proteggere questi animali
   incredibili. Fino alla sua misteriosa morte nel 1985. Se non l’hai visto,
   corri a cercarlo.

      1987 - L’uomo che piantava gli alberi - regia di Frédéric Back

   Hai letto l’omonimo libro di Jean Giono? Beh, direi che se ami le storie a
   lieto fine e gli alberi non puoi fare a meno di cercarlo (e poi lo terrai
   sempre vicino sul tuo comodino). Questo cortometraggio d’animazione – del
   resto – s’ispira in modo molto aderente e poetico all’opera del noto
   scrittore francese. Si tratta di una storia di speranza, dove i primi
   protagonisti – ghiande di Quercia, Faggi, Betulle e Salici – riescono a
   cancellare un’epoca di guerre e di distruzioni, d’ignoranza e di aridità.
   Grazie, certo, all’opera silenziosa e costante di un uomo solitario e
   dignitoso: il pastore Elzéard Bouffier.

     N.B. La voce narrante è di Toni Servillo e i disegni sembrano perdersi e
     ritrovarsi nel vento, come le ombre e le rocce durante il commino della
     storia. Molto bello e rintracciabile anche su YouTube (!).

   Tirando le somme

   In realtà, facendo un’indagine sul tema degli alberi nel cinema, di titoli
   ne sono saltati fuori molti altri. Persino i Guardiani della Galassia,
   sono saltati su. Pensa un po’ tu (!).

   Del resto, dovremmo forse citare anche il ciocco di legno da cui Geppetto
   ricava Pinocchio. E poi ci sarebbe l’albero cavo ne Il labirinto del fauno
   (2006). Oppure – volendo avere qualche piccolo brivido – si può pensare
   agli alberi posseduti de La casa (1981) ovvero all’albero demoniaco di
   Poltergeist (1982). E che dire degli alberi di mele de Il mago di Oz?

   Sì, grande salto indietro fino al 1939. Ma siamo certi che non è tutto qui
   e che anche nel prossimo futuro (e forse pure più in là!) la creatività
   dei registi penserà al verde. Ripenserà il verde, forse.

     Così ti proponiamo, con molta fiducia nel potere della fantasia e della
     comunicazione, di tornare sull’argomento. Ci piacerebbe farlo, adesso
     che ne abbiamo parlato un po’ qui, anche ‘dal vero’. Proprio sotto la
     Quercia de La Trinità. Aspetta l’invito: arriverà.

   Di stagione in stagione.

   [IMG]una fregata armata a tre alberi, Grand Turk

   Viene definito albero un palo verticale impiegato per il sostegno delle
   vele in una nave e in qualsiasi altro mezzo di trasporto a propulsione
   velica. Imbarcazioni più grandi possono armare alberi diversi per numero,
   dimensione e configurazione delle vele. Alberi con altre funzioni sono
   utilizzati anche sulle navi a propulsione meccanica.

Storia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Fino al XX secolo gli alberi di un veliero erano realizzati in legno.
   Inizialmente realizzati con singoli tronchi, con il crescere delle
   dimensioni dei velieri gli alberi furono realizzati assemblando più fusti
   insieme.

   Gli alberi attrezzati per vele quadre sono formati da tre parti: fuso
   maggiore, albero di gabbia e alberetto (dal basso verso l'alto).
   Nei velieri a tre o più alberi, quello a poppa, se non è a vele quadre,
   prende anche il nome di palo, che si ritrova anche nella denominazione di
   vari tipi di antichi bastimenti a vela (es. Brigantino a palo).
   L'albero inclinato a prua è il bompresso.

   A seconda della sua posizione assume diverso nome:

     * albero di maestra, l'albero principale, l'albero più alto o, nel caso
       di golette con alberi di uguale altezza, l'albero poppiero;
     * albero di mezzana, l'albero situato a poppavia dell'albero di maestra;
     * albero di trinchetto, l'albero situato a proravia dell'albero di
       maestra.

   Gli alberi dei moderni velieri sono forniti sulla faccia poppiera di una
   canaletta che serve per ospitare l'inferitura della randa, che può essere
   costituita da una ralinga o da una serie di garrocci cuciti sulla ralinga.
   L'albero è tenuto in posizione verticale dalle manovre dormienti dette
   sartie (quelle laterali), strallo (quella prodiera), paterazzo (quella
   poppiera).
   A seconda delle dimensioni dell'imbarcazione e quindi dell'albero si
   possono avere uno o più ordini di crocette, che servono per distanziare le
   sartie dall'albero e quindi per distribuire meglio le tensioni a cui
   vengono sottoposte.
   Ad una certa altezza dalla coperta, sulla faccia poppiera dell'albero si
   articola, attraverso la trozza, il boma, un'asta di dimensioni consone a
   quelle dell'albero che serve per poter distendere e bordare la base della
   randa.
   Alcune imbarcazioni sono armate con un albero appoggiato in coperta, in
   tal caso l'albero è fornito di una mastra che va ad inserirsi sulla scassa
   dell'albero (la sua sede sulla coperta).
   Altre imbarcazioni sono equipaggiate con alberi "passanti", che cioè
   attraverso la coperta si appoggiano sul fondo dell'imbarcazione (sentina).
   In alcuni casi all'interno dell'albero passano manovre correnti: le
   drizze. Esse sono rinviate su pulegge poste in testa d'albero e servono
   per issare le vele.
   La parte superiore dell'albero si chiama "formaggetta" e può ospitare la
   luce di fonda, la stazione del vento e le eventuali antenne per VHF, GPS
   etc.

   Anticamente la parte superiore dell'albero era detta colombiere.
   L'estremità inferiore maschio o miccia. In cima all'albero era collocata
   una piattaforma, detta coffa, dotata di un'apertura chiamata buco del
   gatto, che consentiva il passaggio degli uomini dell'equipaggio.

Albero moderno[modifica | modifica wikitesto]

   Anche se nel XIX secolo le navi a vela furono sostituite dalle navi a
   motore, si è continuato a progettare e costruire imbarcazioni a vela per
   la crociera e lo sport. Nel 1930 alberi in alluminio furono introdotti nei
   grandi J-class della Coppa America.
   L'alluminio è considerato più vantaggioso del legno nella realizzazione di
   alberi essendo più robusto e resistente alle rotture anche se più leggero.
   Inoltre, un albero di alluminio può essere realizzato per l'intera
   lunghezza con un'unica estrusione.

   Dopo la seconda guerra mondiale, gli alberi di alluminio divennero comuni
   anche sulle piccole derive e sugli yacht da crociera. Imbarcazioni con
   prestazioni più elevate iniziarono ad utilizzare alberi affusolati,
   ottenuti rimuovendo una sezione triangolare di alluminio per la lunghezza
   dell'albero e richiudendo poi l'apertura.
   Dalla metà degli anni '90, nelle imbarcazioni da regata fu introdotto
   l'uso delle fibre di carbonio e altri materiali compositi per costruire
   alberi dotati di una ancora maggiore resistenza in rapporto al peso. La
   riduzione del peso in alto, che nel caso di grandi imbarcazioni può essere
   dell'ordine di centinaia di chili, comporta una riduzione dello
   sbandamento e del beccheggio. Inoltre gli alberi in fibra di carbonio
   possono essere realizzati con profili aerodinamici che rispondano a più
   precisi requisiti di progettazione.

   Gli alberi moderni costituiscono il bordo principale del profilo alare
   della vela e tendono ad avere una sezione trasversale a forma di goccia
   allungata. Sui più piccoli yacht e catamarani da regata, l'albero ruota
   all'angolo ottimale per il profilo alare della vela. Se l'albero ha una
   sezione lunga e sottile e compone una zona significativa del profilo
   alare, esso è denominato albero alare; le barche che usano questo profilo
   hanno una superficie velica minore per compensare la superficie alare
   dell'albero.

   alberi © Matthew Murphy/Unsplash

   Protagonisti o scenografia, comparse o primedonne, da tempo gli alberi
   hanno piantato le proprie radici anche al cinema. Ecco alcuni film nei
   quali alberi e foreste rubano la scena agli attori in carne e ossa.

L’uomo che piantava gli alberi, di Frédéric Back (1987)

   IFrame

   Questo cortometraggio d’animazione è un inno alla speranza, in un’epoca
   contrassegnata da guerre e distruzione, l’uomo si dimostra ancora capace
   di generare la vita. La pellicola, tratta dall’omonimo libro di Jean
   Giono, narra la storia di Elzéard Bouffier, solitario pastore ritiratosi
   sulle montagne del sud della Francia dopo la morte del figlio e della
   moglie. L’uomo, agli inizi del Novecento, inizia un’opera di
   rimboschimento, piantando col suo bastone appuntito migliaia di ghiande.
   La versione italiana, uscita a vent’anni di distanza dall’originale, ha la
   voce di Toni Servillo come narratore.

The Tree Of Life, di Terrence Malick (2011)

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsGS8_f0H6Y

   “L’albero della vita”, il titolo dice tutto. Il film è incentrato in
   apparenza sulla vita di una famiglia della middle-class americana degli
   anni Cinquanta, gli O’Brien, composta da un padre autoritario, tre figli
   ed una madre che funge da collante. Nella filosofica e visionaria opera
   del regista texano l’albero è reale, la gigantesca quercia presente nel
   giardino della famiglia O’Brien, e metaforico e racchiude l’essenza della
   vita dagli albori dell’universo ad oggi.

Alberi, di Michelangelo Frammartino (2013)

   È difficile incasellare “Alberi” in un genere, forse non è neppure un
   film, l’opera di Frammartino è stata definita una cine-istallazione che
   gioca con il concetto di tempo dando vita a un ciclo infinito. Il film è
   un viaggio alla scoperta di un antico culto arboreo, quello dei romiti,
   gli uomini–albero che nell’antichità usavano ricoprirsi d’edera fino a
   diventare irriconoscibili, camminavano con un bastone, al quale era legato
   un ramo di pungitopo o di ginestra e bussavano alle porte delle case per
   ricevere l’elemosina.

Il segreto degli alberi, di Alessandro Toffanelli (2012)

   Pini, querce, lecci, eucalipti, sono tra i protagonisti di questo film
   ambientato nel Parco Migliarino San Rossore. Il film racconta la storia di
   Giovanni che eredita una baracca nel cuore del parco, il posto in cui
   tanti anni prima si era suicidato il padre. Giovanni cerca di
   riconciliarsi con la memoria del padre cercando le tracce delle storie sul
   bosco che gli raccontava da bambino, trovandosi coinvolto in eventi
   misteriosi.

Il Signore degli Anelli: Le due torri, di Peter Jackson (2002)

   La pellicola tratta dalla saga letteraria di John Ronald Reuel Tolkien è
   ricca di mostri e bizzarre creature: elfi, hobbit, orchi e draghi. Tra
   questi nel secondo capitolo della trilogia spicca Barbalbero, albero
   antropomorfizzato soprannominato il “Pastore degli alberi” e
   rappresentante più antico degli Ent. Barbalbero e i suoi compagni giocano
   un ruolo decisivo nella sconfitta di Saruman.

Harry Potter e la camera dei segreti (2002)

   Anche l’universo fantasy creato dalla fervida immaginazione di J. K.
   Rowling, autrice della saga di Harry Potter da cui è stato tratto il film,
   è popolato da mostri e creature di ogni sorta, tra queste troviamo un
   albero particolare. Gli alberi, anche se umanizzati, sono solitamente
   caratterizzati da una placida bonarietà, non è il caso del Platano
   picchiatore. Si tratta di un grande albero piantato nel cortile di
   Hogwarts che una volta colpito, colpisce a sua volta tutto ciò che è nelle
   sue vicinanze.

Alberi che camminano, di Erri de Luca (2014)

   IFrame

   Il racconto dei viaggi di un albero. Il documentario di de Luca, che sarà
   presentato in anteprima mondiale all’interno della 55esima edizione
   Festival dei Popoli di Firenze il 2 dicembre, narra la seconda vita degli
   alberi, destinati a diventare navi, sculture, strumenti musicali, croci di
   vetta. Tra le storie raccontate quelle di Gabriele Mirabassi, il suo
   clarinetto e suoi fabbricanti e di Mauro Corona a spasso tra gli alberi
   cresciuti sulla frana del Vajont.

Il segreto del Bosco vecchio, di Ermanno Olmi (1993)

   Delicata parabola ecologica sul rispetto per l’ambiente tratta da un
   racconto animista di Dino Buzzati. Olmi delinea una favola nella quale non
   soltanto parlano gli animali, ma anche le ombre e i venti. Il
   protagonista, il colonnello Sebastiano Procolo, ha ereditato dallo zio
   parte delle sue tenute, il cosiddetto “Bosco vecchio”, mentre il resto è
   stato lasciato al nipote dodicenne di Sebastiano. Il colonnello è però
   disposto a tutto per diventare il padrone dell’intera zona per poterne
   sfruttare appieno le potenzialità e abbattere tutti gli alberi. Quando il
   bosco ne intuisce le intenzioni ricorre ad una serie di geni, custodi
   degli alberi, che possono magicamente trasformarsi in animali o in uomini,
   per difendersi.

Pocahontas, di Mike Gabriel e Eric Goldberg (1995)

   Anche nel film di animazione della Disney, basato sulla storia del
   personaggio di Pocahontas Rolfe, troviamo un albero animato. È Nonna
   salice, vecchio e nodoso albero a cui la protagonista si rivolge per
   chiedere consiglio nei momenti di difficoltà. “Ascolta il tuo cuore”, è la
   risposta di Nonna salice.

Gorilla nella nebbia, di Michael Apted (1988)

   Protagonisti del film sono i gorilla di montagna e le straordinarie
   foreste del Ruanda. Qui, all’interno del Volcanoes National Park, si è la
   recata zoologa statunitense Dian Fossey per studiare i gorilla. Il film
   racconta la vera storia di una donna che dedicò diciotto anni
   all’osservazione dei gorilla di montagna, proteggendoli dai bracconieri.
   Fu uccisa misteriosamente nel 1985.

                       La top 10 degli alberi del cinema

  Accompagnamo Groot e i Guardiani della Galassia nelle sale con la lista dei
  nostri alberi cinematografici preferiti.

   Cosa sono gli alberi? Sono solo semplici pezzi di legno? O sono saggi e
   antichi esseri che sopravviveranno alla nostra morte? Forse sono entrambi.
   Forse non sono nessuno dei due. Forse la stiamo facendo più grossa di
   quanto non sia in realtà. Comunque, con l’uscita nei cinema di Guardiani
   della Galassia, i verdi arbusti ottengono una nuova, entusiasmante chiave
   di lettura: Groot, il legnoso camminatore dello spazio che parla con la
   suadente voce di Vin Diesel. In suo onore, abbiamo pensato bene di
   proporvi una lista dei migliori alberi mai visti sul grande schermo.

  Groot – Guardiani della Galassia (2014)

   In realtà, Groot non è un albero: si tratta di una creatura senziente
   simile a un albero proveniente dallo spazio profondo, in quanto monarca
   del Pianeta X… insomma, non è certo qualcosa che si trova nel parchetto
   sotto casa. È vero, non è certo il più loquace della lista, visto che sa
   dire solo “Io sono Groot”, ma da quelle tre parole traspare sempre un
   significato più profondo. Anche perché Groot è super intelligente,
   praticamente un esperto di ingegneria della sovrapposizione
   quasi-dimensionale… è solo che la sua laringe non emette suoni di facile
   comprensione per l’orecchio umano. E comunque, rimane pur sempre un
   piacevole riparo dal sole.

  Barbalbero – Il Signore degli Anelli: Le due torri (2002)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/treebeard-720x405_srxm.jpg

   Padre e padrone della foresta di Fangorn, il più antico degli Ent e
   l’anima della festa. O forse no: Barbalbero parla in maniera compassata,
   sta bene attento a prendersi i suoi tempi (il motto è “non avere fretta”)
   e quasi ammazza di noia Pipino e Merry durante il loro incontro. Sebbene
   lui e i suoi fratelli Ent abbiano giocato un ruolo fondamentale nella
   caduta di Saruman e del suo esercito di orchi, Barbalbero è l’equivalente
   fatto albero dei cordiali, logorroici vecchini che ti raccontano la loro
   vita sui mezzi pubblici.

  L’albero cavo – Il labirinto del fauno (2006)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/pans-labyrinth-720x405_etzq.jpg

   Trattandosi di qualcosa concepito da Guillermo del Toro, non sarete
   sorpresi nel sapere che questo non è uno di quegli alberi dove ci si
   ritrova con gli amici per un amorevole tea party. No, l’albero de Il
   labirinto del fauno è una quercia contorta che ospita disgustosi insetti,
   scarafaggi e, non di meno, un rospo capace di rendere immortali. In questi
   casi, la regola da seguire è una sola: se nella foresta trovate un albero
   con un buco abbastanza grande da entrarci dentro in qualche modo, o che -
   ancora peggio - nasconde un portale per un mondo misterioso, lasciate
   perdere: ci sono tanti altri alberi con cui giocare.

  Platano Picchiatore – Harry Potter e la camera dei segreti (2002)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/whomping-willow_9qy5.jpg

   Gli alberi sono quasi tutti stupidotti: se ne stanno lì imbronciati mentre
   incidiamo i nostri nomi nella corteccia, o mentre cerchiamo di scalarli.
   Il Platano Picchiatore di Hogwarts, d’altro canto, ha un bel caratterino.
   Piantato nel 1971, questo albero nasconde il passaggio che unisce la
   scuola alla Stamberga Strillante… e se qualcuno prova a passare, si becca
   una frustata di rami dritta in faccia. È la natura che si ribella? Forse
   M. Night Shyamalan stava cercando di dirci qualcosa in E venne il
   giorno...

  Alberi posseduti – La casa (1981)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/evil-dead-tree_ju7k.png

   È una delle immagini più terribili dell’era “video nasty”: gli alberi del
   demonio che profanano il corpo di un’urlante Ellen Sandweiss. Il fatto che
   qualcosa di così semplice e innocente come un albero sia stato usato in
   maniera così sporca e horror dovrebbe farvi capire come ragiona la mente
   di Sam Raimi, un uomo che con la giusta inquadratura potrebbe farvi
   sembrare satanica anche una tazza di cereali. Ad ogni modo, gli alberi de
   La casa non sono certamente raccomandati per un picnic, né tantomeno per
   passeggiate romantiche.

  Agente 13 – Agente Smart (2008)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/get-smart-bill-murray-720x407_1j36.jpg

   Questo è sicuramente uno dei cameo più bizzarri della carriera di Bill
   Murray… sì, anche più bizzarro di quello in Benvenuti a Zombieland.
   Durante questa breve apparizione, il comico chiacchiera del più e del meno
   con l’agente Smart, chiedendogli di tornare a trovarlo mentre è ancora “in
   missione” nel suo costume da albero: vedere solo la faccia di Murray, al
   contempo triste e sorridente, spuntare da un grosso tronco rende tutto più
   divertente, in qualche modo.

  Nonna Salice – Pocahontas (1995)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/pocahontas-willow_t17u.jpg

   "Pocahontas... quell’albero mi sta parlando!" Con la sua faccia di
   corteccia verde e quegli occhi neri e incavati, la cara nonna Salice
   potrebbe essere il frutto di un incubo da indigestione del nostro amico
   Guillermo del Toro. Per fortuna siamo nell’universo Disney, e un albero
   con la faccia e una canzone nel repertorio è una cosa tranquillissima. Nel
   film, Nonna Salice dice a Pocahontas di ascoltare il suo cuore... noi,
   tuttavia, non vi consigliamo di chiedere consigli agli alberi, a meno che
   non vogliate essere presi in giro sul giornalino del quartiere.

  Il (metaforico) albero della vita – The Tree Of Life (2011)

   Per quanto ho capito io, Terrence Malick non si riferiva letteralmente a
   un albero della vita nel suo The Tree Of Life. Era più un discorso
   riferito a… tutti gli alberi. Tipo la natura, cose così. A modo nostro
   siamo tutti alberi, no? Mettiamo radici, estendiamo i nostri rami,
   perdiamo le foglie… mhh… no, momento, c’era davvero un albero in The Three
   Of Life, Brad Pitt e la sua famiglia ci giravano attorno parecchio nel
   film. Grazie al cielo. È quello l’albero di cui parlavo. Davvero.
   Dimenticatevi delle altre robe. Quello sì che era un albero che spaccava!

  Gli alberi di mele – Il mago di Oz (1939)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/wizard-of-oz-720x540_65wq.jpg

   C’è parecchia roba da incubo ne Il mago di Oz (eh!), ma l’idea che degli
   alberi parlanti ti strillino di tutto mentre raccogli i loro frutti, come
   succede a Dorothy, è parecchio angosciante. La cosa causa loro dolore
   fisico? Perché sembrerebbe dargli davvero fastidio. Per dire, un albero
   chiede a Dorothy qualcosa tipo “Come la prenderesti se qualcuno, passando,
   si prendesse un pezzo di te?”. Tutti gli alberi la vivono così male?
   Vorrete forse dirmi che in autunno gli alberi che perdono le foglie hanno
   la depressione da calvizie? È terribile!

   Ad ogni modo, per fortuna lo Spaventapasseri interviene prima che Doroty
   ottenga dagli alberi un trattamento in stile La casa.

  L’albero demoniaco – Poltergeist (1982)

   Link:
   https://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_it/screenshot/default/poltergeist-720x389_yuck.jpg

   I genitori di oggi hanno parecchio a cui pensare, anche senza l’assillo di
   un albero demoniaco che rapisce i loro bambini attraverso le finestre. OK,
   non è certo roba di tutti i giorni, ma potrebbe capitarvi se abitate in
   una casa costruita su un vecchio cimitero indiano: i figli dei coniugi
   Freeling, per dire, hanno dovuto respingere più volte le avances degli
   abitanti del loro giardino. Le cose sarebbero forse cambiate se i
   Freelings avessero mostrato più amore verso il loro albero? Tipo montando
   un’altalena con cui dondolare assieme? O magari arrampicandosi dolcemente
   sui suoi rami? Secondo me, la risposta è “assolutamente sì”. Anche gli
   alberi hanno dei sentimenti.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Si conclude la nostra folle, folle lista degli alberi cinematografici
   preferiti da IGN. Diteci se siete d’accordo, se avete un albero preferito
   nella vita o, se preferite, il nome di un dottore. Ma che sia bravo, eh!

   Per il loro significato simbolico, i giganti della natura sono stati
   raffigurati come soggetti di importanti opere letterarie e pittoriche.
   Anche il Grande Schermo li ha spesso utilizzati nei film e non solo come
   elementi scenografici. In alcuni casi ne ha fatto dei veri e propri
   personaggi principali, se non addirittura dei protagonisti. Scopriamo
   quali sono gli alberi più famosi del cinema.

Gli alberi più famosi del Cinema

   La storia degli alberi è antichissima. Da sempre rappresentano il rapporto
   tra l’uomo e la natura. Con il passare del tempo sono stati attribuiti
   diversi significati agli alberi, considerati simbolo della vita e di
   saggezza, ma anche di potenza e prosperità. Sono anche il simbolo
   indiscutibile di un collegamento tra il mondo sotterraneo, quello fisico e
   quello celeste. Il salice, ad esempio, è simbolo di rinascita, gioia,
   vitalità. Anche il grande schermo ha utilizzato gli alberi per veicolare
   significati particolari, ecco quali sono i tre più famosi del cinema.

L’Albero delle Anime in Avatar

   Con un diametro di circa 60 metri, l’Albero delle Anime è simile a un
   salice gigante. Ad aver ispirato l’Albero delle Anime è in realtà un
   glicine e, per la precisione, il più grande del Giappone. L’Albero delle
   Anime di Avatar è molto importante nella religione e nella cultura della
   tribù Naivi. Rappresenta, infatti, una connessione con Eiwa, un’entità
   divina chiamata anche la Grande Madre, protettrice dell’equilibrio
   naturale di Pandora.

Il Platano Picchiatore in Harry Potter

   Un altro tra gli alberi più famosi del cinema moderno è Il Platano
   Picchiatore di Harry Potter che, nella versione originale del film è in
   realtà il Salice Schiaffeggiante. Si tratta di un albero magico che, se
   toccato, reagisce muovendosi e colpendo tutto ciò che lo ha urtato. È
   infatti il responsabile della distruzione della Trabant, la macchina in
   cartone compresso che vi va a sbattere contro. L’auto è donata dalla
   cooperazione magica ai dipendenti più poveri, come Arthur Wisley. Il
   figlio Ron riceverà proprio per questo una sonora Strillettera!

Nonna Salice in Pocahontas

   Come lascia intuire il nome, Nonna salice è un vecchio Salice al cui
   interno vive uno spirito indiano con le sembianze di una vecchina. E' a
   lei che Pocahontas si rivolge come consigliera ogni volta che ha un
   dubbio, come per esempio quando il padre la vuole costringere a sposare il
   guerriero Kocoum. Pocahontas le racconta un sogno ricorrente di una
   freccia che la guarda e poi ruota via in fretta per fermarsi poco dopo.
   Quella freccia, secondo Nonna Salice, indica la via. Sono tanti gli
   spiriti invisibili ai nostri occhi ma sempre presenti in natura e pronti a
   guidarci. Dove? Dentro il nostro cuore, perché è lì che si nascondono
   tutte le risposte. Basta solo (re)imparare ad ascoltare il cuore.

   Gli Alberi di Natale più iconici del cinema e della tv

             Gli Alberi di Natale più iconici del cinema e della tv

   8 Dicembre 2020 • Di Andrea Suatoni
   [IMG] [IMG]
   CINEMA , SERIETV

   Come da tradizione, l’8 Dicembre segna nel nostro paese l’inizio ufficiale
   delle festività natalizie; una delle cose che si fa coincidere con questa
   data è solitamente il “rituale” di addobbare l’Albero di Natale, simbolo
   vero e proprio dell’arrivo del Natale.
   In ogni film che si rispetti che celebra il Natale (a anche solo che lo
   nomini!) è praticamente d’obbligo inserire un Albero di Natale degno di
   questo nome; nella storia del cinema sono moltissimi gli Alberi
   protagonisti di scene evocative della magia del Natale, o che magari sono
   diventate invece dei piccoli cult perché legati a particolari colpi di
   scena o sequenze: ecco, in occasione dell’8 Dicembre, 8 dei più iconici
   Alberi di Natale tratti da altrettanti celebri film!

  UN NATALE DA CHARLIE BROWN

   Lo spoglio Albero di Natale che compare in Un Natale da Charlie Brown,
   speciale con protagonisti i Peanuts datato 1965, è il simbolo della
   depressione – costante – di Charlie Brown, stavolta in versione feste
   natalizie. Chiamato a fare il regista della recita natalizia, Charlie
   Brown sceglie un Albero che viene bocciato da tutti i suoi amici; i
   Peanuts dimostrano però poi che bastano solo un po’ di amore e di cura per
   rendere grandioso qualcosa di precedentemente insignificante.

  GREMLINS

   Iconica anche la scena che coinvolge un Albero di Natale in Gremlins: nel
   film, un ragazzo, Billy, riceve in dono per Natale un gremlin, un
   “animaletto domestico” fin troppo impegnativo che finisce per diventare (o
   meglio, “creare”) un vero e proprio pericolo sia per lui che per la sua
   famiglia. Quando la madre di Billy si trova circondata da una piccola
   banda di gremlins ostili, riesce a disfarsi di tutti tranne che di quello
   rimasto nascosto nell’Albero di Natale. Nella scena dell’attacco, sembra
   che sia proprio l’Albero stesso ad attaccare la donna, salvata infine solo
   dall’intervento di suo figlio.

  MAMMA HO PERSO L’AEREO: MI SONO SMARRITO A NEW YORK

   La saga di Mamma ho Perso l’Aereo è un’altra costante del Natale ormai da
   moltissimo tempo: proprio quest’anno Macaulay Culkin in effetti ha
   compiuto ben (!) 40 anni. Nel secondo capitolo della saga, fa la sua
   figura un Albero di Natale a sua volta iconico anche nella vita reale: si
   tratta di quello che ogni anno viene esposto a New York al Rockfeller
   Center, alto quasi 25 metri.
   Il Rockfeller Tree è uno dei principali simboli del Natale newyorkese, ed
   in effetti compare in un numero altissimo di film e serie tv: le scene di
   Mamma ho Perso l’Aereo 2 però riescono forse a catturarne meglio lo
   spirito tramite il giovane Kevin, per il quale assume connotati
   profondamente simbolici.

  C’E’ POSTA PER TE

   In C’è Posta Per Te, c’è una scena in cui Kathleen (Meg Ryan) addobba
   l’Albero di Natale ripensando a sua madre (e alle canzoni di Joni
   Mitchell) in un momento molto toccante del film. L’Albero di Kathleen di
   per se non è particolarmente importante, ma porta in scena uno degli
   aspetti più malinconici del Natale e di ogni altra festa a cadenza
   ciclica: quel momento in cui la mente ci porta a pensare a tutte le
   persone con cui abbiamo trascorso i Natali passati e, per un motivo o per
   l’altro, non sono più con noi.

  HARRY POTTER E LA PIETRA FILOSOFALE

   Il primo Natale ad Hogwarts è sicuramente il più speciale per Harry Potter
   e per i fan del Wizarding World: le opulente decorazioni della sala
   comune, l’enorme Albero tagliato da Hagrid nella foresta vicina, gli
   addobbi posizionati tramite la magia: la tradizionale “Magia del Natale”
   assume qui una prospettiva completamente diversa. Si tratta inoltre del
   primo vero Natale per Harry, stupito dall’aver ricevuto “addirittura” dei
   regali.

  DOWNTON ABBEY

   L’enorme albero nella sala centrale di Downton Abbey è un simbolo iconico
   degli speciali e degli episodi natalizi dello show: enorme ed opulento,
   l’usanza di addobbare al centro del Grand Saloon un Albero di Natale
   “fuori misura” è in realtà una vera tradizione dei possessori
   dell’Highclere Castle, il luogo (ribattezzato per la fiction appunto
   Downton Abbey) in cui la serie veniva girata.
   Ancora oggi, la Contessa di Carvarvon, attuale proprietaria di Highclere,
   adorna il Grand Saloon con un Albero di Natale enorme e riccamente
   addobbato, che richiede ore ed ore di preparazione per essere ultimato.

  POLAR EXPRESS

   Entrato a far parte del Guinnes dei Primati come il primo film creato in
   CGI utilizzando la tecnica della performance capture, Polar Express
   presenta una scena il cui vero protagonista è un Albero di Natale: il
   giovane protagonista della pellicola finisce per credere in Babbo Natale
   proprio in una enorme piazza al cui centro svetta un altissimo abete,
   usato anche come uno dei principali simboli del film e sfruttato a livello
   visivo più e più volte nella pellicola.

   BONUS: SPELACCHIO

   IFrame

   Infine, impossibile non citare anche Spelacchio, lo “sfortunato” Albero di
   Natale che divenne famoso nel 2017 dopo essere durato solamente poche
   settimane al centro di Piazza Venezia a Roma. Rinominato “Spelacchio” a
   causa della sua natura non proprio florida, l’enorme abete rosso perì di
   stenti prima di raggiungere il 25 Dicembre, dando il via ad una vera e
   propria ondata di meme: Netflix non si lasciò sfuggire l’occasione
   pubblicitaria, e l’anno successivo si offrì di allestire un nuovo Albero
   di Natale in Piazza Venezia al posto del Comune di Roma. Spelacchio, ormai
   il nome ufficiale adottato per ogni Albero che ha transitato negli ultimi
   anni nella Piazza di Roma, diventò protagonista di un piccolo corto
   ironico, con Pino Insegno a fornirgli la parola: eccolo riportato per
   intero nel video soprastante!

     Il mio sambuco
     china la testa
     verso di me
     e io gli dico:
     “Fammi salire
     bel principe
     sul tuo cavallo”
     Lui mi porta
     nel suo castello verde                                             
     pieno di luce
     e io rido felice

   Marzia anni 8
   da “Mario Lodi, Gli alberi”, catalogo della mostra omonima tenutasi nel
   1999 presso il Centro Culturale Santa Maria della Pietà a Cremona.

   La figura dell’albero è presente in molte culture, religioni, miti e
   leggende popolari.
   L’Albero della Vita è stato posto da Dio nell’Eden insieme all’Albero del
   bene e del Male.
   L’albero è un riparo sotto il quale pensare e dialogare per Socrate.
   All’ombra di un mango meditava Buddha.
   Fatta di quercia era la prua di Argo la rapida, la nave degli Argonauti.
   Molti sono i personaggi trasformati in alberi nella mitologia greca.

   La quercia è sacra per i Celti così come il rovere e il nocciolo, i frutti
   di quest’ultimo erano considerati il simbolo della saggezza per il loro
   guscio duro e tenace capace di resistere impassibile alle debolezze umane.

   Il nocciolo è anche la pianta di cui Cenerentola chiede un rametto al
   padre. Rametto che lei pianterà sulla tomba della madre e che una volta
   divenuto albero offrirà riparo all’uccellino da cui riceverà ciò che le
   serve per recarsi al famoso ballo.

   Dietro un albero di nocciolo si rifugiò la Madonna per sfuggire ad una
   serpe, infatti i rami di questo albero sono usati per scacciare le serpi.

   Gli alberi sono Fratelli Saggi per i Nativi Americani e sull’albero sale
   lo sciamano per essere in contatto, attraverso le radici, con le
   profondità della terra e, attraverso i rami, con il cielo infinito.

   Cristo è Sole e Albero.

   Secondo la mitologia nordica al centro della terra c’è Yggdrasil, l’Albero
   che con i suoi rami sorregge la volta celeste e le cui radici affondano
   nelle profondità degli inferi.

   Per ogni tipo d’albero c’è una storia o una leggenda legata a una
   religione, a una credenza o filosofia.

  La figura dell’albero è una figura che si potrebbe definire archetipica,
  l’albero siamo noi e la sua sorte è legata a quella dell’uomo.

   Una volta la terra ferma era ricoperta di alberi, foreste e boschi. Il
   bosco rappresentava un luogo avvolto nel mistero ed era fonte di vita e di
   morte. L’albero è fortemente presente nella vita dell’uomo, forse è per
   questo che nei libri per bambini e ragazzi torna prepotentemente. E’
   presente con ruolo di metafora o come simbolo. E’ luogo di rifugio. Ha il
   valore iniziatico di passaggio. E’ luogo su cui arrampicarsi per vedere
   oltre. E’ amico e nemico.

   Uno dei libri che più rappresenta il valore dell’albero nella vita
   dell’uomo è, a mio parere, Storia di un albero di Emile Vast. Un albo che
   ha un particolare formato rettangolare, lungo e stretto dove l’artista
   usando solo tre colori – nero, ocra, bianco – e pochissime parole ci
   racconta il valore dell’albero.

   Intorno ad esso, l’uomo, che non compare mai ma di cui percepiamo la
   presenza – nella scala, nella carriola, nel rastrello, nella bicicletta –
   e gli altri animali nascono, vivono. L’albero offre riparo e nutrimento, è
   punto di incontro. Mai come in questo libro l’albero è descritto nella sua
   funzione primaria, che è quella di dispensare vita.

   Storia di un albero                 L’albero è quel pezzo di natura
   intorno al quale, sul quale e attraverso il quale, la vita si snoda.

   Storia di un albero

   Forse è per questo che Jean Giono affida al piantare gli alberi un valore
   salvifico e di riconciliazione con la natura in uno dei periodi più tristi
   della storia europea, nel suo L’uomo che piantava gli alberi.

   L’albero è compagno di giochi e poi riparo, per la bambina protagonista di
   Oltre l’albero di Mandana Sadat.

   Una bimba gioca felice in un bosco. Nel bosco c’è una casa dalle finestre
   illuminate. La bambina è incuriosita. Guarda dentro e vede un volto di
   vecchia, ne è spaventata – sul perché ognuno può fare le sue
   considerazioni. I bambini a cui ho mostrato il libro, che è un silent
   book, hanno tratto le loro conclusioni – scappa e si rifugia dietro un
   albero sperando di non essere vista.

   Oltre l'albero

   La vecchia si siede allora dall’altra parte dell’albero e inizia a
   narrare. La pianta che era separazione e rifugio diventa mediatrice, tanto
   che la bambina esce dal suo nascondiglio incuriosita dalle parole della
   vecchia. Noi non vediamo mai l’albero nella sua interezza né il bosco,
   entrambi rappresentati in maniera essenziale eppure fortemente presenti.

   Oltre l'albero

   In Oltre l’albero troviamo il bosco con il suo carico di simbologie: bosco
   e alberi come gioco e luogo di piacere, ma anche come luogo in cui si
   annidano pericoli. L’albero può essere rifugio, ma dietro vi si possono
   anche nascondere dei mostri.

   Gli alberi sono tremendi nemici ne La notte degli alberi di Roger Norman.

   Alan si è appena trasferito nella mansarda. Ora ha una stanza tutta per sé
   e non deve più dividere lo spazio con la sorellina e tutti i suoi
   peluches.

   Dormirà da solo nella mansarda! Non sa che sta per vivere una delle più
   straordinarie avventure che un umano abbia mai vissuto!

   La notte degli alberi

   Alan, come d’altro canto gli altri umani, non sa che quella che sta per
   affrontare è la Notte degli Alberi, ovvero la notte in cui gli umani
   dormono un sonno stregato e gli alberi se ne vanno in giro liberamente
   fino all’alba. Ma perché se ne vanno in giro? Perché si riuniscono per
   quella che chiamano la Prima Ora?

   Sarà un grande viaggio quello di Alan, rapito da Messer Frassino e
   costretto nel suo tronco, non più libero nemmeno di pensare, Frassino gli
   legge nel pensiero, dovrà imparare di essere un Vivente tra i Viventi. Gli
   alberi criticheranno la sua eccessiva velocità, loro sono lentissimi, ma
   anche la caducità dell’Uomo, la sua arroganza nel credersi animale
   superiore.

   Alan, nella tremenda Notte degli Alberi si scontra e si incontra con vari
   esponenti del mondo vegetale: la quercia puntigliosa e saccente, il tasso
   ingannatore, l’ontano che non si cura degli altri alberi ma lo aiuta, la
   betulla dispettosa.

   In questo romanzo la natura si rivela perfida e vendicativa, ma con un
   profondo senso del giusto. Gli alberi possono essere crudeli e pericolosi,
   ma anche amichevoli e protettivi. Come è la Natura.

   Forse per questo è il luogo prediletto nel quale rifugiarsi. L’albero,
   come ci racconta Antonio Faeti nel suo saggio su Stephen King, è luogo sul
   quale costruire case nelle quali fare cose proibite, raccontare e
   raccontarsi. La casa sull’albero è fuga dal mondo degli adulti civilizzati
   portatori di una cultura “altra” da cui ci si vuole distanziare. Salire
   sull’albero è un atto di protesta. Sale sull’albero il militante
   ecologista per impedirne il taglio, come il calviniano Cosimo Piovasco di
   Rondò ci sale per sfuggire alle volontà paterne e prendere le distanze.

   Sale sull’albero Mina ne La storia di Mina di Almond, per riflettere,
   sognare, scrivere e disegnare. L’albero è per Mina luogo di osservazione
   del mondo che la circonda – i nuovi vicini – e della vita degli uccelli
   che per lei rappresentano una sorta di magia evoluzionistica e il simbolo
   di come la natura nella sua perfezione sia riuscita nel volo.

     Mi piace il mio albero. Sarà un paio d’anni che vengo quassù. Mi
     arrampico fino a un ramo un po’ più in alto della mia testa e mi ci
     metto a cavalcioni con la schiena appoggiata al tronco… Qualche volta
     sto seduta qui per ore, a disegnare o a leggere o solo a pensare,
     guardare, ascoltare e divagare.

   L’albero per Mina è casa. Vi si arrampica senza problemi. E’ un pensatoio,
   un luogo di riflessione.

   È una scuola e da lì, guarda quel mondo che la considera strana.

   E’ il luogo dove progetta le sue attività straordinarie, ovvero tutta una
   serie di attività che potrebbero sembrare senza senso, ma che in realtà
   portano a vivere la vita con pienezza e a sentirla, tra queste

   Andate a dormire. Dormite volando. Volate dormendo.

   Salgono sull’albero Aglaia e l’adulta Bianca ne La casa sull’albero di
   Bianca Pitzorno e vi si stabiliscono. La fantasia galoppante della
   Pitzorno ci racconta un albero surreale e dai mille innesti tanto che è
   possibile mangiare qualsiasi frutto. Un serraglio di animali e umani si
   stabiliscono sull’albero delle due amiche.

   La casa sull'albero

   Perché salire sull’albero vuol dire uscire dal mondo delle regole adulte e
   allora tutto può succedere anche che una gatta impari a suonare il flauto,
   una cagna voli e cinguetti e dei neonati si esprimano in poesia

   L’albero è luogo di gioco e di sogni su cui costruire una casa, per i
   protagonisti di L’estate delle cicale di Janna Carioli.

   La casa è progettata con cura, costruita e arredata. Diventa luogo di
   sogni e di viaggi immaginari, perché da una casa sull’albero il lago può
   diventare il mare e i suoi abitati dei pirati o dei naufraghi.

   L'estate delle cicale

   Poi, un giorno tutto finisce a causa di un litigio. Gli animali che
   dell’albero sono i padroni si riappropriano dello spazio fino al giorno in
   cui, anni dopo, due ragazzini, spingendosi sui rami più alti la scoprono,
   si incontrano e la casa torna ad essere una nave pirata.

   Nelle splendide illustrazioni di Sonia MariaLuce Possentini, non vediamo
   né la casa né l’albero, ci siamo dentro.

   Ancora un albero, curato, amato, abbracciato e scalato è al centro del
   bellissimo romanzo di Angela Nanetti Mio nonno era un ciliegio.

   La voce narrante è quella di un ragazzino, Tonino, che racconta la sua
   vita attraverso il rapporto con il nonno Ottaviano che vive in campagna e
   che ha piantato un ciliegio in occasione della nascita della sua prima ed
   unica figlia, la madre del Tonino.

   Il ciliegio, che è stato chiamato Felice, cresce con la bambina e diviene
   compagno di giochi sul quale arrampicarsi. Apprendiamo tutto ciò grazie al
   racconto del protagonista che ci descrive vecchie foto.

   Tonino inizialmente è troppo piccolo per salire sull’albero, allora il
   nonno si toglie le scarpe, si mette il nipote sulle spalle e si arrampica.

   Mio nonno era un ciliegio

   Il rapporto tra il nonno e il ragazzo è fortemente legato al ciliegio.
   Quando il nonno non può arrampicarsi, il bambino si dondola sull’altalena
   e lo guarda lavorare nell’orto. Sarà il nonno ad insegnare al ragazzo ad
   ascoltare il respiro degli alberi.

   Il ciliegio diviene il simbolo di un passaggio di testimone dal nonno a
   Tonino e da quest’ultimo alla sorellina Corinna, nata quando Ottaviano è
   gravemente malato e dopo una crisi famigliare, quasi a simboleggiare una
   rinascita

   I miei amici mi hanno chiesto tante volte di salire, ma io ho detto sempre
   di no. Porterò solo Corinna sul ciliegio quando sarà più grande, e a lei
   insegnerò tutto quello che il nonno ha insegnato a me.

   In questo splendido romanzo l’albero è memoria, riparo, fonte di cibo e
   luogo di giochi. È anche qualcosa da proteggere. Uno dei momenti che più
   mi ha commosso leggendolo è quando il vecchio Ottaviano, durante una
   gelata tardiva, accende sotto l’albero dei fuochi per tenere in caldo le
   gemme. La natura va protetta, perché siamo noi.

   Forse è per questo che Jean Giono affida al piantare gli alberi un valore

   della storia europea, nel suo L’uomo che piantava gli alberi.

   L’albero è compagno di giochi e poi riparo, per la bambina protagonista di

   annidano pericoli. L’albero può essere rifugio, ma dietro vi si possono
   anche nascondere dei mostri.

   Gli alberi sono tremendi nemici ne La notte degli alberi di Roger Norman.

   Alan si è appena trasferito nella mansarda. Ora ha una stanza tutta per sé
   e non deve più dividere lo spazio con la sorellina e tutti i suoi
   peluches.

   Dormirà da solo nella mansarda! Non sa che sta per vivere una delle più
   straordinarie avventure che un umano abbia mai vissuto!

   La notte degli alberi

   Alan, come d’altro canto gli altri umani, non sa che quella che sta per
   affrontare è la Notte degli Alberi, ovvero la notte in cui gli umani
   dormono un sonno stregato e gli alberi se ne vanno in giro liberamente
   fino all’alba. Ma perché se ne vanno in giro? Perché si riuniscono per
   quella che chiamano la Prima Ora?

   Sarà un grande viaggio quello di Alan, rapito da Messer Frassino e

   alberi criticheranno la sua eccessiva velocità, loro sono lentissimi, ma

   esponenti del mondo vegetale: la quercia puntigliosa e saccente, il tasso
   ingannatore, l’ontano che non si cura degli altri alberi ma lo aiuta, la
   betulla dispettosa.

   In questo romanzo la natura si rivela perfida e vendicativa, ma con un
   profondo senso del giusto. Gli alberi possono essere crudeli e pericolosi,
   ma anche amichevoli e protettivi. Come è la Natura.

   Forse per questo è il luogo prediletto nel quale rifugiarsi. L’albero,
   come ci racconta Antonio Faeti nel suo saggio su Stephen King, è luogo sul
   quale costruire case nelle quali fare cose proibite, raccontare e
   raccontarsi. La casa sull’albero è fuga dal mondo degli adulti civilizzati
   portatori di una cultura “altra” da cui ci si vuole distanziare. Salire
   sull’albero è un atto di protesta. Sale sull’albero il militante
   ecologista per impedirne il taglio, come il calviniano Cosimo Piovasco di
   Rondò ci sale per sfuggire alle volontà paterne e prendere le distanze.

   Sale sull’albero Mina ne La storia di Mina di Almond, per riflettere,
   sognare, scrivere e disegnare. L’albero è per Mina luogo di osservazione
   del mondo che la circonda – i nuovi vicini – e della vita degli uccelli
   che per lei rappresentano una sorta di magia evoluzionistica e il simbolo
   di come la natura nella sua perfezione sia riuscita nel volo.

     Mi piace il mio albero. Sarà un paio d’anni che vengo quassù. Mi
     arrampico fino a un ramo un po’ più in alto della mia testa e mi ci
     metto a cavalcioni con la schiena appoggiata al tronco… Qualche volta
     sto seduta qui per ore, a disegnare o a leggere o solo a pensare,
     guardare, ascoltare e divagare.

   L’albero per Mina è casa. Vi si arrampica senza problemi. E’ un pensatoio,
   un luogo di riflessione.

   È una scuola e da lì, guarda quel mondo che la considera strana.

   E’ il luogo dove progetta le sue attività straordinarie, ovvero tutta una
   serie di attività che potrebbero sembrare senza senso, ma che in realtà
   portano a vivere la vita con pienezza e a sentirla, tra queste

   Andate a dormire. Dormite volando. Volate dormendo.

   Salgono sull’albero Aglaia e l’adulta Bianca ne La casa sull’albero di
   Bianca Pitzorno e vi si stabiliscono. La fantasia galoppante della
   Pitzorno ci racconta un albero surreale e dai mille innesti tanto che è
   possibile mangiare qualsiasi frutto. Un serraglio di animali e umani si
   stabiliscono sull’albero delle due amiche.

   La casa sull'albero

   Perché salire sull’albero vuol dire uscire dal mondo delle regole adulte e
   allora tutto può succedere anche che una gatta impari a suonare il flauto,
   una cagna voli e cinguetti e dei neonati si esprimano in poesia

   L’albero è luogo di gioco e di sogni su cui costruire una casa, per i
   protagonisti di L’estate delle cicale di Janna Carioli.

   La casa è progettata con cura, costruita e arredata. Diventa luogo di
   sogni e di viaggi immaginari, perché da una casa sull’albero il lago può
   diventare il mare e i suoi abitati dei pirati o dei naufraghi.

   L'estate delle cicale

   Poi, un giorno tutto finisce a causa di un litigio. Gli animali che
   dell’albero sono i padroni si riappropriano dello spazio fino al giorno in
   cui, anni dopo, due ragazzini, spingendosi sui rami più alti la scoprono,
   si incontrano e la casa torna ad essere una nave pirata.

   Nelle splendide illustrazioni di Sonia MariaLuce Possentini, non vediamo
   né la casa né l’albero, ci siamo dentro.

   Ancora un albero, curato, amato, abbracciato e scalato è al centro del
   bellissimo romanzo di Angela Nanetti Mio nonno era un ciliegio.

   La voce narrante è quella di un ragazzino, Tonino, che racconta la sua
   vita attraverso il rapporto con il nonno Ottaviano che vive in campagna e
   che ha piantato un ciliegio in occasione della nascita della sua prima ed
   unica figlia, la madre del Tonino.

   Il ciliegio, che è stato chiamato Felice, cresce con la bambina e diviene
   compagno di giochi sul quale arrampicarsi. Apprendiamo tutto ciò grazie al
   racconto del protagonista che ci descrive vecchie foto.

   Tonino inizialmente è troppo piccolo per salire sull’albero, allora il
   nonno si toglie le scarpe, si mette il nipote sulle spalle e si arrampica.

   Mio nonno era un ciliegio

   Il rapporto tra il nonno e il ragazzo è fortemente legato al ciliegio.
   Quando il nonno non può arrampicarsi, il bambino si dondola sull’altalena
   e lo guarda lavorare nell’orto. Sarà il nonno ad insegnare al ragazzo ad
   ascoltare il respiro degli alberi.

   Il ciliegio diviene il simbolo di un passaggio di testimone dal nonno a
   Tonino e da quest’ultimo alla sorellina Corinna, nata quando Ottaviano è
   gravemente malato e dopo una crisi famigliare, quasi a simboleggiare una
   rinascita

   I miei amici mi hanno chiesto tante volte di salire, ma io ho detto sempre
   di no. Porterò solo Corinna sul ciliegio quando sarà più grande, e a lei
   insegnerò tutto quello che il nonno ha insegnato a me.

   In questo splendido romanzo l’albero è memoria, riparo, fonte di cibo e
   luogo di giochi. È anche qualcosa da proteggere. Uno dei momenti che più
   mi ha commosso leggendolo è quando il vecchio Ottaviano, durante una
   gelata tardiva, accende sotto l’albero dei fuochi per tenere in caldo le
   gemme. La natura va protetta, perché siamo noi.

   Albero di una barca a vela

   Sono grandi bastoni, diritti e verticali, fissati perpendicolarmente sul
   coperchio e il corpo della nave, sopportando il peso della maggior parte
   delle manovre. Naturalmente, le navi piÃ¹ grandi tendono ad avere un
   maggior numero di alberi.

   Essi sono soggetti morti dal lato delle manovre della barca, che aumenta
   la stabilitÃ  e la capacitÃ  di sopportare forze laterali.

   Quando gli alberi supplementari sono stati costruiti, stavano ricevendo i
   seguenti nomi:

   alberi barca a vela

   Trinchetto, piÃ¹ vicino all'albero di prua (anticipo) l'albero principale
   o maestro.
   Mezzana Ã¨ un bastone dietro (piÃ¹ vicino alla poppa) che l'albero
   principale o maestro.

   bastone Contramesana o la fortuna: su imbarcazioni con quattro alberi
   verticali era il nome dato al secondo montante (piÃ¹ di mezzana) che si
   trova dietro l'albero maestro.

   Palo bompresso, non solo montante in posizione verticale.

   Sporgente dalla prua (la formazione di circa 15 a 45 gradi rispetto al
   piano orizzontale) e le candele chiamati fiocchi, triangolari sono
   pressare. Nel XVIII secolo il bompresso ha raggiunto dimensioni quasi
   grande come l'albero di trinchetto.

   [IMG]Schema di un albero di maestra generico [IMG]Il vascello britannico
   H.M.S. Victory alla fonda a Portsmouth: l'albero di maestra sta al centro

   L'albero di maestra è l'albero maggiore delle navi a vela. Solitamente è
   costituito da quattro parti ben distinte; partendo dal basso si ha:

     * Fuso maggiore di maestra (1)
     * Albero di gabbia (2)
     * Alberetto di gran velaccio (3)
     * Alberetto di controvelaccio (4)

   In corrispondenza delle specifiche zone dell'albero appena descritte si
   trovano i rispettivi pennoni (più uno volante); partendo sempre dal basso:

     * Pennone di maestra (I)
     * Pennone di bassa gabbia (II)
     * Pennone di gabbia volante (III)
     * Pennone di gran velaccio (IV)
     * Pennone di controvelaccio (V)

   I nomi delle vele inferite sull'albero di maestra prendono il nome dai
   rispettivi pennoni:

     * Maestra (a)
     * Bassa gabbia (b)
     * Gabbia volante (c)
     * Velaccio (d)
     * Controvelaccio (e)

   Normalmente le grandi vele basse dei velieri erano chiamati anche "trevi"
   (trevo di trinchetto, trevo di maestra).

   [IMG]Esempio di albero genealogico della famiglia di Sigmund Christoph von
   Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg

   L'albero genealogico è generalmente l'elenco completo degli antenati, o
   più specificamente, un grafico utilizzato nella genealogia per mostrare i
   rapporti familiari tra individui. Non sempre è facile risalire
   cronologicamente agli antenati in assenza di documentazione accertata.
   Nelle ricerche private il "di" e il "fu", che precede il nome del
   genitore, vivo o defunto, permette di risalire più facilmente all'antenato
   che precede il nominativo conosciuto.

   Le grafiche che rappresentano gli alberi genealogici sono disparate e
   molteplici e spesso le diramazioni molto estese richiedono un'elaborazione
   che non sempre è contenibile nei formati cartacei tradizionali.

   Abitualmente l'albero genealogico viene realizzato utilizzando delle
   caselle, quadrate per i maschi e circolari per le femmine, contenenti i
   nomi di ciascuna persona, spesso corredati di informazioni aggiuntive,
   quali luogo e data di nascita e morte, in alcuni casi inserendo
   l'occupazione o la professione. Tali simboli, disposti dall'alto verso il
   basso in ordine cronologico, sono connessi da vari tipi di linee che
   rappresentano i matrimoni e unioni extraconiugali e la discendenza.

   In alcuni casi, se non è possibile ad esempio inserire un grafico, è
   possibile descrivere gli antenati di una persona utilizzando una tavola
   genealogica.^[1] Inoltre, uno dei modi più semplici e veloci per creare un
   albero genealogico è quello di utilizzare dei modelli.

  Этимология

   Происходит от праслав. *dervo «дерево», от кот. в числе прочего произошли:
   ст.-слав. дрѣво (род. п. дрѣвесе и дрѣва; др.-греч. ξύλον, δένδρον),
   русск., укр. де́рево, сербохорв. дри̏jево, словенск. drevô, drevė̑sa,
   чешск. dřevo, словацк. drevo, польск. drzewo, в.-луж. drjewo, н.-луж.
   drjowo; восходит к праиндоевр. *derw- «дерево, дрова; дуб». Родственно
   лит. dervà «сосна», вин. der̃va; с другим вокализмом: darva «смола»,
   латышск. darva «смола», англос. teru «смола», греч. δόρυ «дерево, брус,
   копьё», δρῦς «дерево (растение), дуб», др.-инд. dāru, dru- «дерево
   (материал)», авест. dauru, -dru- «дерево», ирл. derucc «жёлудь», галльск.
   dervo — в местн. н. Dervus «дубовый лес». Сюда же готск. triu, англ. tree
   «дерево», хеттск. taru — то же. Использованы данные словаря М. Фасмера.

  Этимология

   Происходит от праслав. *dervo «дерево», от кот. в числе прочего произошли:
   ст.-слав. дрѣво (род. п. дрѣвесе и дрѣва; др.-греч. ξύλον, δένδρον),
   русск., укр. де́рево, сербохорв. дри̏jево, словенск. drevô, drevė̑sa,
   чешск. dřevo, словацк. drevo, польск. drzewo, в.-луж. drjewo, н.-луж.
   drjowo; восходит к праиндоевр. *derw- «дерево, дрова; дуб». Родственно
   лит. dervà «сосна», вин. der̃va; с другим вокализмом: darva «смола»,
   латышск. darva «смола», англос. teru «смола», греч. δόρυ «дерево, брус,
   копьё», δρῦς «дерево (растение), дуб», др.-инд. dāru, dru- «дерево
   (материал)», авест. dauru, -dru- «дерево», ирл. derucc «жёлудь», галльск.
   dervo — в местн. н. Dervus «дубовый лес». Сюда же готск. triu, англ. tree
   «дерево», хеттск. taru — то же. Использованы данные словаря М. Фасмера.

   Абстрактное синтаксическое дерево (AST)

Определение

   Начнём сразу с примера.

   Возьмём арифметическое выражение 1 + (2 * 3).

   Абстрактным синтаксическим деревом (abstract syntax tree, AST) для него
   будет следующее:

   Ast

   Абстрактное синтаксическое дерево выражения 1 + (2 * 3).

   Объясним словосочетание «абстрактное синтаксическое дерево» по частям.

   «Дерево» — см. рисунок.

   «Синтаксическое» — значит, отражает структуру (синтаксис) исходного
   выражения. А именно, узлы дерева соответствуют операциям (сложению и
   умножению), а листья соответствуют операндам (числам). Каждый узел дерева
   отражает конкретную операцию исходного выражения (и наоборот).

   «Абстрактное» — дерево «очищено» от вспомогательных символов,
   использующихся в исходной строке (для данного примера  — отсутствуют
   скобки).

   Итак, абстрактное синтаксическое дерево — дерево, отражающее структурные
   связи между существенными элементами исходного выражения (строкой
   рассматриваемого языка), но не отражающее вспомогательные языковые
   средства.

AST и естественный язык

   Несколько упрощая, абстрактным синтаксическим деревом предложения

 Мама мыла раму

   является

   Ast natural

   «Абстрактное синтаксическое дерево» предложения на русском языке

   Предикат (то есть глагол) стоит в узле. Его референты (в математике мы их
   называли «операнды», а в лингвистике «актанты»: объект и субъект) отходят
   от предиката листьями.

AST vs parse tree

   Важно не путать «абстрактное синтаксическое дерево» и «дерево парсинга»
   (parse tree).

   Собственно, у них одно отличие: дерево парсинга «конкретно», то есть
   содержит все вспомогательные языковые средства.

   А абстрактное (= очищенное) синтаксическое дерево содержит то и только то,
   что существенно для понимания предложения (в языках программирования под
   «пониманием» имеется в виду вычисление/выполнение).

   Например, в языке Ruby можно получить «parse tree» с помощью следующей
   команды:

 require 'ripper'

 code = "1 + (2 * 3)"
 pp Ripper.sexp(code)

   На выходе мы получим вот такой массив, являющийся префиксным выражением
   (S-expression):

 [:program,
  [[:binary,
    [:@int, "1", [1, 0]],
    :+,
    [:paren, [[:binary, [:@int, "2", [1, 5]], :*, [:@int, "3", [1, 9]]]]]]]]

   В виде дерева вот как выглядит:

   Ripper parse tree

   Ruby-специфичный parse tree выражения 1 + (2 * 3).

   Нас здесь интересует следующее: в parse tree нашёл отражение тот факт, что
   (2 * 3) была взята в скобки (получился узел :paren).

   Нужна ли эта информация для вычисления выражения? Нет, не нужна, так как в
   дереве и так видно, что первым выполняется умножение (оно стоит на более
   низком уровне дерева), а следом сложение (которое использует в правой
   ветке результат умножения).

   Логика такая: детали языковых средств записи попали в дерево. Значит, это
   не «абстрактное» дерево. Значит, это не AST, а parse tree.

   На AST смотри выше.

Как изобразить AST

   Предложение «мама мыла раму» можно написать мелом на доске, можно печатным
   текстом в книге, можно ручкой в тетради. Это будет всё то же предложение.

   Точно также и AST можно изобразить в виде рисунка (как здесь), можно
   записать на бумаге (или в тексте) линейно как префиксное выражение, а
   можно сохранить на жёсткий диск в виде последовательности байтов.

   А можно в виде структуры на каком-нибудь языке программирования, например:

 ["мыла", ["мама", "раму"]]

   Концептуальной разницы это не создаёт. Без ограничения общности мы все
   такие варианты будем назвывать «абстрактными синтаксическими деревьями»,
   хотя это может быть не буквальный рисунок дерева, а массив (структура
   данных внутри языка разработки парсера), линейный текст, либо
   последовательность зарядов электронов на SSD-диске.

AST и парсинг

   На этапе парсинга наша задача — получить из выражения (из программы)
   именно AST (для дальнейшей обработки и/или вычисления).

   При этом алгоритмы парсинга и средства автогенерации парсеров создают,
   изначально, parse tree. Получается, возникает дополнительная задача
   специально отметить те узлы parse tree, которые должны попасть в AST.

   Рассмотрим на примере. Пусть дана следующая грамматика:

 @lt;function_call@gt; ::=
   @lt;variable@gt; '(' @lt;arguments_or_nothing@gt; ')'

 @lt;arguments_or_nothing@gt; ::= @lt;arguments@gt; | ε

 @lt;arguments@gt; ::=
   number ',' @lt;arguments@gt;
   | number

 @lt;variable@gt; ::= string

   Где string это строка, соответствующая регулярному выражению [a-z].

   Данная грамматика соответствует строкам типа f(1), multiply(2,5), now() и
   т. п.

   Рассмотрим строку multiply(2,5). Parse tree, соответствующее этой строке,
   следующее:

   Function call parse tree

   Дерево парсинга для строки “multiply(2,5)” в заданной грамматике

   Итак, дерево парсинга (parse tree) однозначно отображает, какие правила
   вывода и в каком порядки были применены и каким терминалам исходной строки
   сопоставлены.

   В методе рекурсивного нисходящего парсинга синие узлы соответствуют вызову
   функции, обрабатывающей указанный нетерминал, а белые узлы — «снятию»
   (shift) символа с входной ленты. Обход дерева сверху вниз и слева направо
   соответствует порядку операций при данном методе парсинге.

   Возникает вопрос: нафига козе боян а зачем нам такое избыточное количество
   информации, все «потроха» синтаксического разбора, если мы хотим просто
   «понять», что видим перед собой «вызов функции со списком таких-то
   аргументов»?

   Мы хотим получить AST. Например, что-то вроде такого:

   Function call ast

   Абстрактное синтаксическое дерево для строки “multiply(2,5)” выбранной
   структуры

   Отметим, что структуру AST разработчик языка выбирает исходя из
   соображений облегчения дальнейшего выполнения кода, «зафиксированного» в
   виде AST.

Трансформация parse tree в AST

   Для преобразования parse tree в некий заранее спроектированный вариант AST
   требуется сделать ряд типовых операций:

     * переименовать некоторые узлы;
     * удалить «служебные» узлы;
     * свернуть порождённое рекурсией поддерево @lt;arguments@gt; в линейный
       список/массив.

   Рассмотрим, для примера, следующую грамматику (упрощённый оператор
   присвоения):

 @lt;assignment@gt; ::= letter "=" number

   Где letter — буква латинского алфавита, number — число.

   Данная грамматика будет соответствовать строкам типа x=5, y=21 и т. д.

   Предположим, что в нашем варианте AST мы для каждого присвоения хотим
   сохранять массив вида ["x", 5], ["y", 21] и т. д. (В данном случае мы,
   говоря AST, имеем в виду в первую очередь внутреннюю структуру данных
   языка разработки, а не её графическое изображение.)

   Тогда мы можем добавить код (в фигурных скобках) к данному правилу в
   следующей манере:

 @lt;assigment@gt; ::= letter "=" number ; { [$1, $3] }

   В системах автоматической генерации парсеров подобный код даёт следующее
   указанию парсеру: «когда обработаешь данное правило вывода (построишь
   соответствующее ему parse tree), возьми первый символ (letter) и третий
   (number) и выполни с ними указанный код (объедини в массив из двух
   элементов) — это и будет AST».

   Все мы знаем о том, что JavaScript-код веб-проектов может разрастаться до
   прямо-таки огромных размеров. А чем больше размер кода — тем дольше
   браузер будет его загружать. Но проблема тут не только во времени передачи
   данных по сети. После того, как программа загрузится, её ещё надо
   распарсить, скомпилировать в байт-код, и, наконец, выполнить. Сегодня мы
   представляем вашему вниманию перевод 14 части серии материалов об
   экосистеме JavaScript. А именно, речь пойдёт о синтаксическом анализе
   JS-кода, о том, как строятся абстрактные синтаксические деревья, и о том,
   как программист может повлиять на эти процессы, добившись повышения
   скорости работы своих приложений.

Как устроены языки программирования

   Прежде чем говорить об абстрактных синтаксических деревьях, остановимся на
   том, как устроены языки программирования. Вне зависимости от того, какой
   именно язык вы используете, вам всегда приходится применять некие
   программы, которые принимают исходный код и преобразуют его в нечто такое,
   что содержит конкретные команды для машин. В роли таких программ выступают
   либо интерпретаторы, либо компиляторы. Неважно, пишете ли вы на
   интерпретируемом языке (JavaScript, Python, Ruby), или на компилируемом
   (C#, Java, Rust), ваш код, представляющий собой обычный текст, всегда
   будет проходить этап парсинга, то есть — превращения обычного текста в
   структуру данных, которая называется абстрактным синтаксическим деревом
   (Abstract Syntax Tree, AST).

   Абстрактные синтаксические деревья не только дают структурированное
   представление исходного кода, они, кроме того, играют важнейшую роль в
   семантическом анализе, в ходе которого компилятор проверяет правильность
   программных конструкций и корректность использования их элементов. После
   формирования AST и выполнения проверок эта структура используется для
   генерирования байт-кода или машинного кода.

Применение абстрактных синтаксических деревьев

   Абстрактные синтаксические деревья используются не только в
   интерпретаторах и компиляторах. Они, в мире компьютеров, оказываются
   полезными и во многих других областях. Один из наиболее часто
   встречающихся вариантов их применения — статический анализ кода.
   Статические анализаторы не выполняют передаваемый им код. Однако, несмотря
   на это, им нужно понимать структуру программ.

   Предположим, вы хотите разработать инструмент, который находит в коде
   часто встречающиеся структуры. Отчёты такого инструмента помогут в
   рефакторинге, позволят уменьшить дублирование кода. Сделать это можно,
   пользуясь обычным сравнением строк, но такой подход окажется весьма
   примитивным, возможности его будут ограниченными. На самом деле, если вы
   хотите создать подобный инструмент, вам не нужно писать собственный парсер
   для JavaScript. Существует множество опенсорсных реализаций подобных
   программ, которые полностью совместимы со спецификацией ECMAScript.
   Например — Esprima и Acorn. Существуют и инструменты, которые могут помочь
   в работе с тем, что генерируют парсеры, а именно, в работе с абстрактными
   синтаксическими деревьями.

   Абстрактные синтаксические деревья, кроме того, широко используются при
   разработке транспиляторов. Предположим, вы решили разработать
   транспилятор, преобразующий код на Python в код на JavaScript. Подобный
   проект может быть основан на идее, в соответствии с которой используется
   транспилятор для создания абстрактного синтаксического дерева на основе
   Python-кода, которое, в свою очередь, преобразуется в код на JavaScript.
   Вероятно, тут вы зададитесь вопросом о том, как такое возможно. Всё дело в
   том, что абстрактные синтаксические деревья — это всего лишь
   альтернативный способ представления кода на некоем языке программирования.
   Прежде чем код преобразуется в AST, он выглядит как обычный текст, при
   написании которого следуют определённым правилам, которые формируют язык.
   После парсинга этот код превращается в древовидную структуру, которая
   содержит ту же информацию, что и исходный текст программы. В результате
   можно осуществить не только переход от исходного кода к AST, но и обратное
   преобразование, превратив абстрактное синтаксическое дерево в текстовое
   представление кода программы.

Парсинг JavaScript-кода

   Поговорим о том, как строятся абстрактные синтаксические деревья. В
   качестве примера рассмотрим простую JavaScript-функцию:

 function foo(x) {
     if (x @gt; 10) {
         var a = 2;
         return a * x;
     }

     return x + 10;
 }

   Парсер создаст абстрактное синтаксическое дерево, которое схематично
   представлено на следующем рисунке.

   Абстрактное синтаксическое дерево

   Обратите внимание на то, что это — упрощённое представление результатов
   работы парсера. Настоящее абстрактное синтаксическое дерево выглядит
   гораздо сложнее. В данном случае наша главная цель — получить
   представление о том, во что, в первую очередь, превращается исходный код
   прежде чем он будет выполнен. Если вам интересно взглянуть на то, как
   выглядит реальное абстрактное синтаксическое дерево — воспользуйтесь
   сайтом AST Explorer. Для того, чтобы сгенерировать AST для некоего
   фрагмента JS-кода, его достаточно поместить в соответствующее поле на
   странице.

   Возможно, тут у вас возникнет вопрос о том, зачем программисту знать о
   том, как работает JS-парсер. В конце концов, парсить и выполнять код — это
   задача браузера. В каком-то смысле вы правы. На рисунке ниже показаны
   затраты времени, требующиеся некоторым известным веб-проектам на
   выполнение различных шагов в процессе выполнения JS-кода.

   Присмотритесь к этому рисунку, возможно, вы увидите там кое-что
   интересное.

   [IMG]
   Временные затраты на выполнение JS-кода

   Видите? Если нет — посмотрите ещё раз. Собственно говоря, речь идёт о том,
   что, в среднем, браузеры тратят 15-20% времени на парсинг JS-кода. И это —
   не некие условные данные. Перед вами — статистические сведения о работе
   реальных веб-проектов, которые так или иначе используют JavaScript.
   Возможно, показатель в 15% может показаться вам не таким уж и большим, но,
   поверьте, это много. Типичное одностраничное приложение загружает примерно
   0.4 Мб JavaScript-кода, а чтобы распарсить этот код браузеру надо примерно
   370 мс. Опять же, вы можете сказать, что в этом нет ничего страшного. И
   да, само по себе это немного. Однако не стоит забывать о том, что это —
   лишь время, которое нужно на то, чтобы разобрать код и превратить его в
   AST. Сюда не входит время, необходимое на выполнение кода, или время,
   которое нужно на решение других задач, сопутствующих загрузке страницы,
   например — задач обработки HTML и CSS и рендеринга страницы. Причём, речь
   тут идёт лишь о настольных браузерах. В случае с мобильными системами всё
   ещё хуже. В частности, время парсинга одного и того же кода на мобильных
   устройствах может быть в 2-5 раз больше, чем на настольных. Взгляните на
   следующий рисунок.

   [IMG]
   Время парсинга 1 Мб JS-кода на различных устройствах

   Здесь показано время, необходимое для разбора 1 Мб JS-кода на различных
   мобильных и настольных устройствах.

   Кроме того, веб-приложения постоянно усложняются, на сторону клиента
   переносится решение всё большего количества задач. Направлено всё это на
   то, чтобы улучшить ощущения пользователей от работы с веб-сайтами, чтобы
   приблизить эти ощущения к тем, которые пользователи испытывают,
   взаимодействуя с традиционными приложениями. Несложно выяснить то,
   насколько сильно всё это воздействует на веб-проекты. Для этого достаточно
   открыть в браузере инструменты разработчика, зайти на какой-нибудь
   современный сайт и посмотреть, сколько времени тратится на парсинг кода,
   на компиляцию, и на всё остальное, происходящее в браузере при подготовке
   страницы к работе.

   Анализ сайта с помощью инструментов разработчика в браузере

   К несчастью, мобильные браузеры не обладают подобными инструментами.
   Однако, это не означает, что мобильные версии сайтов невозможно
   анализировать. Тут нам на помощь придут инструменты вроде DeviceTiming. С
   помощью DeviceTiming можно измерить время, необходимое для парсинга и
   выполнения скриптов в управляемых окружениях. Работает это благодаря
   помещению локальных скриптов в окружение, формируемое вспомогательным
   кодом, что приводит к тому, что каждый раз, когда страница загружается с
   различных устройств, у нас появляется возможность локально измерить время
   парсинга и выполнения кода.

Оптимизация парсинга и JS-движки

   JS-движки делают много полезного для того, чтобы избежать ненужной работы
   и оптимизировать процессы обработки кода. Вот несколько примеров.

   Движок V8 поддерживает потоковую передачу скриптов и кэширование кода. Под
   потоковой передачей в данном случае понимается то, что система занимается
   парсингом скриптов, загружающихся асинхронно, и скриптов, выполнение
   которых отложено, в отдельном потоке, начиная это делать с момента начала
   загрузки кода. Это ведёт к тому, что парсинг завершается практически
   одновременно с завершением загрузки скрипта, что даёт примерно 10%
   уменьшение времени, необходимого на подготовку страниц к работе.

   JavaScript-код обычно компилируется в байт-код при каждом посещении
   страницы. Этот байт-код, однако, теряется после того, как пользователь
   переходит на другую страницу. Происходит это из-за того, что
   скомпилированный код сильно зависит от состояния и контекста системы во
   время компиляции. Для того чтобы улучшить ситуацию в Chrome 42 появилась
   поддержка кэширования байт-кода. Благодаря этому новшеству
   скомпилированный код хранится локально, в результате, когда пользователь
   возвращается на уже посещённую страницу, для подготовки её к работе не
   нужно выполнять загрузку, парсинг и компиляцию скриптов. Это позволяет
   Chrome сэкономить примерно 40% времени на задачах парсинга и компиляции.
   Кроме того, в случае с мобильными устройствами, это ведёт к экономии
   заряда их аккумуляторов.

   Движок Carakan, который применялся в браузере Opera и уже довольно давно
   заменён на V8, мог повторно использовать результаты компиляции уже
   обработанных скриптов. При этом не требовалось, чтобы эти скрипты были бы
   подключены к одной и той же странице или даже были бы загружены с одного
   домена. Эта техника кэширования, на самом деле, весьма эффективна и
   позволяет полностью отказаться от шага компиляции. Она полагается на
   типичные сценарии поведения пользователей, на то, как люди работают с
   веб-ресурсами. А именно, когда пользователь следует определённой
   последовательности действий, работая с веб-приложением, загружается один и
   тот же код.

   Интерпретатор SpiderMonkey, используемый в FireFox, не занимается
   кэшированием всего подряд. Он поддерживает систему мониторинга, которая
   подсчитывает количество вызовов определённого скрипта. На основе этих
   показателей определяются участки кода, которые нуждаются в оптимизации, то
   есть — те, на которые приходится максимальная нагрузка.

   Конечно, некоторые разработчики браузеров могут решить, что кэширование их
   продуктам и вовсе не нужно. Так, Масей Стачовяк, ведущий разработчик
   браузера Safari, говорит, что Safari не занимается кэшированием
   скомпилированного байт-кода. Возможность кэширования рассматривалась, но
   она до сих пор не реализована, так как генерация кода занимает менее 2%
   общего времени выполнения программ.

   Эти оптимизации не влияют напрямую на парсинг исходного кода на JS. В ходе
   их применения делается всё возможное, чтобы, в определённых случаях,
   полностью пропустить этот шаг. Каким бы быстрым ни был парсинг, он, всё
   же, занимает некоторое время, а полное отсутствие парсинга — это, пожалуй,
   пример идеальной оптимизации.

Сокращение времени подготовки веб-приложений к работе

   Как мы выяснили выше, хорошо было бы свести необходимость в парсинге
   скриптов к минимуму, но совсем избавиться от него нельзя, поэтому
   поговорим о том, как сократить время, необходимое для подготовки
   веб-приложений к работе. На самом деле, для этого можно сделать очень
   много всего. Например, можно минимизировать объём JS-кода, входящего в
   приложение. Код маленького объёма, готовящий страницу к работе, можно
   быстрее разобрать, да и его выполнение, вероятнее всего, займёт меньше
   времени, чем у кода более объёмного.

   Для того чтобы сократить объём кода, можно организовать загрузку на
   страницу только того, что ей действительно необходимо, а не некоего
   огромного куска кода, в который входит абсолютно всё, нужное для
   веб-проекта в целом. Так, например, паттерн PRPL продвигает именно такой
   подход к загрузке кода. В качестве альтернативного варианта можно
   проверить зависимости и посмотреть, есть ли в них что-то избыточное,
   такое, что приводит лишь к неоправданному разрастанию кодовой базы. На
   самом деле, тут мы затронули большую тему, достойную отдельного материала.
   Вернёмся к парсингу.

   Итак, цель данного материала заключается в обсуждении методик, позволяющих
   веб-разработчику помочь парсеру быстрее делать его работу. Такие методики
   существуют. Современные JS-парсеры используют эвристические алгоритмы для
   того, чтобы определить, понадобится ли выполнить некий фрагмент кода как
   можно скорее, или его нужно будет выполнить позже. Основываясь на этих
   предсказаниях, парсер либо полностью анализирует фрагмент кода, применяя
   алгоритм жадного синтаксического анализа (eager parsing), либо использует
   ленивый алгоритм синтаксического анализа (lazy parsing). При полном
   анализе разбираются функции, которые нужно скомпилировать как можно
   скорее. В ходе этого процесса выполняется решение трёх основных задач:
   построение AST, создание иерархии областей видимости и поиск
   синтаксических ошибок. Ленивый анализ, с другой стороны, используется
   только для функций, которые пока не нуждаются в компиляции. Здесь не
   создаётся AST и не выполняется поиск ошибок. При таком подходе лишь
   создаётся иерархия областей видимости, что позволяет сэкономить примерно
   половину времени в сравнении с обработкой функций, которые нужно выполнить
   как можно скорее.

   На самом деле, концепция это не новая. Даже устаревшие браузеры вроде IE9
   поддерживают подобные подходы к оптимизации, хотя, конечно, современные
   системы ушли далеко вперёд.

   Разберём пример, иллюстрирующий работу этих механизмов. Предположим, у нас
   имеется следующий JS-код:

 function foo() {
     function bar(x) {
         return x + 10;
     }

     function baz(x, y) {
         return x + y;
     }

     console.log(baz(100, 200));
 }

   Как и в предыдущем примере, код попадает в парсер, который выполняет его
   синтаксический анализ и формирует AST. В результате парсер представляет
   код, состоящий из следующих основных частей (на функцию foo обращать
   внимания не будем):

     * Объявление функции bar, которая принимает один аргумент (x). Эта
       функция имеет одну команду возврата, она возвращает результат сложения
       x и 10.
     * Объявление функции baz, которая принимает два аргумента (x и y). У неё
       тоже одна команда возврата, возвращает она результат сложения x и y.
     * Выполнение вызова функции baz с двумя аргументами — 100 и 200.
     * Выполнение вызова функции console.log с одним аргументом, которым
       является значение, возвращённое ранее вызванной функцией.
   Вот как это выглядит.

   Результат разбора кода примера без применения оптимизации

   Поговорим о том, что здесь происходит. Парсер видит объявление функции
   bar, объявление функции baz, вызов функции baz и вызов функции
   console.log. Очевидно, разбирая этот фрагмент кода, парсер столкнётся с
   задачей, выполнение которой никак не отразится на результатах выполнения
   данной программы. Речь идёт об анализе функции bar. Почему анализ этой
   функции не несёт практической пользы? Всё дело в том, что функция bar, как
   минимум, в представленном фрагменте кода, никогда не вызывается. Этот
   простой пример может показаться надуманным, но во множестве реальных
   приложений имеется большое количество функций, которые никогда не
   вызываются.

   В подобной ситуации, вместо того, чтобы заниматься разбором функции bar,
   мы можем просто сделать запись о том, что она объявлена, но нигде не
   используется. При этом настоящий парсинг этой функции производится тогда,
   когда в ней возникнет необходимость, непосредственно перед её выполнением.
   Естественно, при выполнении ленивого синтаксического анализа нужно
   обнаружить тело функции и сделать запись о её объявлении, но на этом
   работа заканчивается. Для такой функции не надо формировать абстрактное
   синтаксическое дерево, так как у системы нет сведений о том, что эту
   функцию планируется выполнять. Кроме того, не выделяется память из кучи,
   что обычно требует немалых системных ресурсов. Если в двух словах, то
   отказ от разбора ненужных функций ведёт к значительному повышению
   производительности кода.

   В результате, в предыдущем примере, настоящий парсер сформирует структуру,
   напоминающую следующую схему.

   Результат разбора кода примера с оптимизацией

   Обратите внимание на то, что парсер сделал запись об объявлении функции
   bar, но дальнейшим её разбором не занимался. Система не предприняла
   никаких усилий для анализа кода функции. В данном случае тело функции
   представляло собой команду возврата результата простых вычислений. Однако
   в большинстве реальных приложений код функций может быть гораздо более
   длинным и сложным, содержащим множество команд возврата, условия, циклы,
   команды объявления переменных и вложенных функций. Разбор всего этого, при
   условии, что такие функции никогда не вызываются, представляет собой
   пустую трату времени.

   В вышеописанной концепции нет ничего сложного, но её практическая
   реализация — задача не из лёгких. Здесь мы рассмотрели очень простой
   пример, а, на самом деле, при принятии решения о том, будет ли некий
   фрагмент кода востребован в программе, нужно анализировать и функции, и
   циклы, и условные операторы, и объекты. В целом можно сказать, что парсеру
   нужно обработать и проанализировать абсолютно всё, что есть в программе.

   Вот, например, весьма распространённый паттерн реализации модулей в
   JavaScript:

 var myModule = (function() {
     // Вся логика модуля
     // Возврат объекта модуля
 })();

   Большинство современных JS-парсеров распознают этот паттерн, он для них
   является сигналом того, что код, расположенный внутри модуля, нужно
   полностью проанализировать.

   А что если бы парсеры всегда использовали ленивый синтаксический анализ?
   Это, к сожалению, не самая хорошая идея. Дело в том, что при таком
   подходе, если некий код надо выполнить как можно скорее, мы столкнёмся с
   замедлением работы системы. Парсер выполнит один проход ленивого
   синтаксического анализа, после чего тут же примется за полный анализ того,
   что нужно выполнить как можно скорее. Это приведёт к примерно 50%
   замедлению в сравнении с подходом, когда парсер сразу приступает к полному
   разбору самого важного кода.

Оптимизация кода с учётом особенностей его разбора

   Теперь, когда мы немного разобрались с тем, что происходит в недрах
   парсеров, пришло время подумать о том, что можно сделать для того, чтобы
   им помочь. Мы можем писать код так, чтобы синтаксический анализ функций
   производился в нужное нам время. Тут существует один паттерн, который
   понимают большинство парсеров. Он выражается в том, что функции заключают
   в скобки. Такая конструкция практически всегда сообщает парсеру о том, что
   функцию надо разобрать безотлагательно. Если парсер обнаруживает
   открывающую скобку, сразу после которой следует объявление функции, он
   немедленно приступит к синтаксическому анализу функции. Мы можем помочь
   парсеру, применяя этот приём при описании функций, которые нужно выполнить
   как можно скорее.

   Предположим, у нас имеется функция foo:

 function foo(x) {
     return x * 10;
 }

   Так как в этом фрагменте кода нет явного указания на то, что эту функцию
   планируется выполнить немедленно, браузер выполнит лишь её ленивый
   синтаксический анализ. Однако мы уверены в том, что эта функция
   понадобится нам очень скоро, поэтому мы можем прибегнуть к следующему
   приёму.

   Для начала сохраним функцию в переменной:

 var foo = function foo(x) {
     return x * 10;
 };

   Обратите внимание на то, что первоначальное имя функции, находящееся между
   ключевым словом function и открывающейся скобкой, мы оставили. Нельзя
   сказать, что это совершенно необходимо, но рекомендуется поступать именно
   так, так как, если при работе функции будет выдано исключение, в данных
   трассировки стека можно будет увидеть имя функции, а не @lt;anonymous@gt;.

   После вышеописанного изменения парсер продолжит использовать ленивый
   синтаксический анализ. Для того чтобы это изменить, достаточно одной
   небольшой детали. Функцию надо заключить в скобки:

 var foo = (function foo(x) {
     return x * 10;
 });

   Теперь, когда парсер обнаружит открывающую скобку перед ключевым словом
   function, он немедленно приступит к разбору этой функции.

   Подобные оптимизации может оказаться непросто выполнять вручную, так как
   для этого нужно знать то, в каких случаях парсер будет выполнять ленивый
   синтаксический анализ, а в каких — полный. Кроме того, для этого нужно
   потратить время на принятие решения о том, нуждается ли конкретная функция
   в как можно более быстрой готовности к работе или нет.

   Программистам, наверняка, не захочется взваливать на себя всю эту
   дополнительную работу. Кроме того, что не мене важно чем всё то, о чём уже
   было сказано, код, обработанный таким образом, будет сложнее читать и
   понимать. В этой ситуации нам на помощь готовы прийти специальные
   программные пакеты вроде Optimize.js. Их основная цель заключается в
   оптимизации времени первоначальной загрузки исходного кода на JS. Они
   выполняют статический анализ кода и модифицируют его так, чтобы функции,
   которые нужно выполнить как можно скорее, были бы заключены в скобки, что
   приводит к тому, что браузер немедленно займётся их разбором и подготовкой
   к выполнению.

   Итак, предположим, что мы программируем, ни о чём особо не задумываясь, и
   у нас имеется следующий фрагмент кода:

 (function() {
     console.log('Hello, World!');
 })();

   Выглядит это вполне нормально, работает так как ожидается, выполняется
   быстро, так как парсер находит открывающую скобку перед ключевым словом
   function. Пока всё отлично. Конечно, прежде чем всё это попадёт в
   продакшн, код надо минифицировать для того, чтобы уменьшить его размер:

 !function(){console.log('Hello, World!')}();

   Вроде и тут всё нормально, код работает так же, как работал раньше. Однако
   если присмотреться, окажется что кое-чего в этом минифицированном
   фрагменте исходной программы не хватает.

   Минификатор убрал скобки, в которые было заключено объявление функции,
   поместив в начало строки восклицательный знак. Это означает, что парсер
   данную строчку пропустит, то, что она будет обработана с использованием
   ленивого синтаксического анализа. Более того, для того, чтобы выполнить
   эту функцию, системе придётся выполнять полный анализ сразу после
   ленивого. Всё это приведёт к тому, что такой вот минифицированный код
   будет работать медленнее, чем его исходный вариант. Теперь пришло время
   вспомнить об инструментах вроде вышеупомянутого Optimize.js. Если
   обработать минифицированный код с помощью Optimize.js, на выходе получится
   следующее:

 !(function(){console.log('Hello, World!')})();

   Это уже больше похоже на то, что нам нужно. Мы получаем и минификацию, и
   оптимизацию кода. Текст программы занимает меньше места на диске, а
   парсеру понятно, какие фрагменты нужно разбирать полностью и как можно
   скорее, а какие — используя методику ленивого синтаксического анализа.

Предварительная компиляция

   Как видите, подготовка JS-кода к работе — дело, требующее немалых
   системных ресурсов. Почему бы не выполнять всё это на сервере? В конце
   концов, гораздо лучше один раз подготовить программу к выполнению и
   передавать то, что получилось, клиентам, нежели принуждать каждую
   клиентскую систему каждый раз обрабатывать исходный код. На самом деле,
   эта возможность сейчас обсуждается, в частности, вопрос заключается в том,
   должны ли браузерные JS-движки предлагать механизмы выполнения
   предварительно скомпилированных скриптов, чтобы освободить браузеры от
   задач по подготовке кода к выполнению. В целом, идея заключается в том,
   чтобы у нас был некий серверный инструмент, умеющий генерировать байт-код,
   который достаточно передать клиенту по сети и выполнить. Это даст
   значительное сокращение времени подготовки веб-страниц к работе. И хотя
   выглядит подобный механизм довольно соблазнительно, на самом деле, не всё
   так просто. Подготовка кода к работе на сервере может произвести обратный
   эффект, так как объём передаваемых данных, вероятно, возрастёт, может
   возникнуть необходимость в подписывании кода и в его проверке для целей
   обеспечения безопасности. Кроме того, JS-движки развиваются в уже
   сформировавшемся русле, в частности, команда разработчиков V8 работает над
   внутренними механизмами движка, направленными на то, чтобы избавиться от
   повторного парсинга. Подобные подходы к оптимизации на стороне клиента
   могут сделать предварительную компиляцию на сервере уже не столь
   привлекательной.

Советы по оптимизации

   Вот несколько рекомендаций, которыми вы можете воспользоваться для
   оптимизации веб-приложений:

     * Проверьте зависимости проекта. Избавьтесь от всего ненужного.
     * Разделите код на небольшие фрагменты вместо того, чтобы складывать его
       в один большой файл.
     * Откладывайте, в тех ситуациях, когда это возможно, загрузку
       JS-скриптов. При обработке текущего маршрута пользователю можно
       выдавать только тот код, который необходим для нормальной работы, и
       ничего лишнего.
     * Используйте инструменты разработчика и средства вроде DeviceTiming для
       того, чтобы находить узкие места своих проектов.
     * Используйте средства вроде Optimize.js для того, чтобы помочь парсерам
       определиться с тем, какие фрагменты кода им нужно обработать как можно
       скорее.

Итоги

   Автор этого материала говорит, что в его компании, которая занимается
   разработкой системы SessionStack, предназначенной для мониторинга и записи
   того, что происходит на веб-страницах, вышеописанные приёмы оптимизации
   начали использовать сравнительно недавно. Это позволяет им сделать так,
   чтобы код приложения быстрее загружался и готовился к работе. Чем быстрее
   это происходит — тем приятнее пользователям будет работать с системой.
   Пожалуй, обеспечение удобства работы пользователей — это одна из задач,
   которую стремятся решить разработчики любого веб-проекта, и то, о чём шла
   речь в этом материале, вполне способно помочь в решении этой задачи.

   Уважаемые читатели! Оптимизируете ли вы ваши веб-проекты с учётом скорости
   загрузки и разбора их JavaScript-кода?

                        * * * Дерево синтаксического разбора¶

   Закончив с реализацией дерева как структуры данных, рассмотрим примеры его
   применения при решении некоторых реальных задач. Этот раздел будет
   посвящён деревьям синтаксического разбора. Они могут использоваться для
   представления таких конструкций реального мира, как предложения
   естественного языка или математические выражения.

   image

   Рисунок 1: Дерево синтаксического разбора простого предложения

   На рисунке 1 изображена иерархическая структура простого предложения.
   Такое представление позволяет нам работать с его отдельными частями,
   используя поддеревья.

   image

   Рисунок 2: Дерево синтаксического разбора выражения \(((7+3)*(5-2))\)

   Также в виде дерева синтаксического разбора можно представить
   математическое выражение наподобие \(((7 + 3) * (5 - 2))\) (см. рисунок
   2). Мы уже рассматривали выражения с полной расстановкой скобок: исходя из
   этого, что можно сказать о данном примере? Нам известно, что умножение
   имеет более высокий приоритет, чем сложение и вычитание. Однако, благодаря
   скобкам мы знаем, что здесь сначала нужно вычислить сумму и разность.
   Иерархия дерева помогает лучше понять порядок вычисления выражения в
   целом. Перед тем, как найти стоящее на самом верху произведение, требуется
   произвести сложение и вычитание в поддеревьях. Первая операция - левое
   поддерево - даст 10, вторая - правое поддерево - 3. Используя свойство
   иерархической структуры, мы можем просто заменить каждое из поддеревьев на
   узел, содержащий найденный ответ. Эта процедура даст упрощённое дерево,
   показанное на рисунке 3.

   image

   Рисунок 3: Упрощённое дерево синтаксического разбора для \(((7+3)*(5-2))\)

   До конца этого раздела мы собираемся как следует протестировать деревья
   синтаксического разбора. Точнее, будет рассмотрено:

     * Как построить дерево разбора для математического выражения с полной
       расстановкой скобок.
     * Как вычислить выражение, хранящееся в дереве разбора.
     * Как записать оригинальное математическое выражение из дерева разбора.

   Первый шаг при постороении дерева синтаксического разбора - это разбить
   строку выражения на список токенов. Их насчитывается четыре вида: левая
   скобка, правая скобка, оператор и операнд. Мы знаем, что прочитанная левая
   скобка всегда означает начало нового выражения и, следовательно,
   необходимо создать связанное с ним поддерево. И наоборот, считывание
   правой скобки сигнализирует о завершении выражения. Так же известно, что
   операнды будут листьями и потомками своих операторов. Наконец, мы знаем,
   что каждый оператор имеет обоих своих потомков.

   Используя сказанную выше информацию, определим следующие правила:

    1. Если считан токен '(' - добавляем новый узел, как левого потомка
       текущего, и спускаемся к нему вниз.
    2. Если считанный один из элементов списка ['+','-','/','*'], то
       устанавливаем корневое значение текущего узла равным оператору из
       этого токена. Добавляем новый узел на место правого потомка текущего и
       спускаемся вниз по правому поддереву.
    3. Если считанный токен - число, то устанавливаем корневое значение
       равным этой величине и возвращаемся к родителю.
    4. Если считан токен ')', то перемещаемся к родителю текущего узла.

   Перед тем, как писать код на Python, давайте рассмотрим в живую
   приведённые выше правила. Мы будем работать с выражением \((3 + (4 * 5))\)
   и разобьём его следующим образом: ['(', '3', '+', '(', '4', '*', '5'
   ,')',')']. Начинать будем с дерева разбора, содержащего пустой корневой
   узел. Рисунок 4 демонстрирует его структуру и содержимое по мере
   вычисления каждого нового токена.

   Рисунок 4: Трассировка постороения дерева разбора.

   Используя этот рисунок, пройдём по примеру шаг за шагом.

   а) Создаём пустое дерево.

   б) Читаем ( в качестве первого токена. По правилу 1 создаём новый узел,
   как левого потомка корня. Делаем его текущим.

   в) Считываем следующий токен - 3. По правилу 3 устанавливаем значение
   текущего узла в 3 и перемещаемся обратно к его родителю.

   г) Следующим считываем +. По правилу 2 устанавливаем корневое значение
   текущего узла в + и добавляем ему правого потомка. Этот новый узел
   становится текущим.

   д) Считываем (. По правилу 1 создаём для текущего узла левого потомка.
   Этот новый узел становится текущим.

   е) Считываем 4. По правилу 3 устанавливаем значение текущего узла равным
   4. Делаем текущим родителя 4.

   ж) Считываем следующий токен - *. По правилу 2 устанавливаем корневое
   значение текущего узла равным * и создаём его правого потомка. Он
   становится текущим.

   з) Считываем 5. По правилу 3 устанавливаем корневое значение текущего узла
   в 5, после чего текущим становится его родитель.

   и) Считываем ). По правилу 4 делаем текущим узлом родителя *.

   к) Наконец, считываем последний токен - ). По правилу 4 мы должны сделать
   текущим родителя +. Но такого узла не существует, следовательно, мы
   закончили.

   Из примера выше очевидна необходимость отслеживать не только текущий узел,
   но и его предка. Интерфейс дерева предоставляет нам способы получить
   потомков заданного узла - с помощью методов getLeftChild и getRightChild,
   - но как отследить родителя? Простым решением для этого станет
   использование стека в процессе прохода по дереву. Перед тем, как
   спуститься к потомку узла, проследний мы кладём в стек. Когда же надо
   будет вернуть родителя текущего узла, мы вытолкнем из стека нужный
   элемент.

   Используя описанные выше правила совместно с операциями из Stack и
   BinaryTree, мы готовы написать на Python функцию для создания дерева
   синтаксического разбора. Код её представлен в ActiveCode 1.

   Постороение дерева синтаксического разбора (parsebuild)

   Четыре правила для постороения дерева разбора закодированы в первых
   четырёх if-ах 11, 15, 19 и 24 строк ActiveCode 1. В каждом случае вы
   видите код, воплощающий одно из описанных выше правил с помощью нескольких
   вызовов методов классов BinaryTree или Stack. Единственная ошибка, на
   которую в этой функции происходит проверка, - ветка else, вызывающая
   исключение ValueError, если мы получаем токен, который не можем рапознать.

   Итак, дерево синтаксического разбора построено, но что с ним теперь
   делать? В качестве первого примера, напишем функцию, вычисляющую дерево
   разбора и возвращающую числовой результат. Для этого будем использовать
   иерархическу природу дерева. Посмотрите ещё раз на рисунок 2. Напоминаем:
   оригинальное дерево можно заменять упрощённым, показанным на рисунке 3.
   Это предполагает возможность написать алгоритм, вычисляющий дерево разбора
   с помощью рекурсивного вычисления каждого из его поддеревьев.

   Как мы уже делали для рекурсивных алгоритмов в прошлом, написание функции
   начнём с выявления базового случая. Естественным базовым случаем для
   рекурсивных алгоритмов, работающих с деревьями, является проверка узла на
   лист. В дереве разбора такими узлами всегда будут операнды. Поскольку
   объекты, подобные целым или действительным числам, не требуют дальнейшей
   интерпретации, функция evaluate может просто возвращать значение,
   сохранённое в листе дерева. Рекурсивный шаг, продвигающий функцию к
   базовому случаю, будет вызывать evaluate для правого и левого потомков
   текущего узла. Так мы эффективно спустимся по дереву до его листьев.

   Чтобы собрать вместе результаты двух рекурсивных вызовов, мы просто
   применим к ним сохранённый в родительском узле оператор. В примере на
   рисунке 3 мы видим, что два потомка корневого узла вычисляются в 10 и 3.
   Применение к ним оператора умножения даст окончательный результат, равный
   30.

   Код рекурсивной функции evaluate показан в листинге 1. Сначала мы получаем
   ссылки на правого и левого потомков текущего узла. Если оба они
   вычисляются в None, значит этот узел - лист. Это проверяется в строке 7.
   Если же узел не листовой, то ищем в нём оператор и применяем его к
   результатам рекурсивных вычислений левого и правого потомков.

   Для реализации арифметики мы используем словарь с ключами '+', '-', '*' и
   '/'. Хранимые в нём значения - функции из модуля операторов Python. Этот
   модуль предоставляет в наше распоряжение множество часто употребляемых
   операторов в виде функций. Когда мы ищем в словаре оператор, извлекается
   связанный с ним объект. А поскольку это функция, то мы можем вызвать её
   обычным способом function(param1, param2). Таким образом, поиск
   opers['+'](2,2) эквивалентен operator.add(2,2).

 8         fn = opers[parseTree.getRootVal()]                                               
 9         return fn(evaluate(leftC),evaluate(rightC))                                      
10     else:                                                                                
11         return parseTree.getRootVal()                                                    

   Наконец, проследим работу функции evaluate на дереве синтаксического
   разбора, которое изображено на рисунке 4. В первом вызове evaluate мы
   передаём ей корень всего дерева в качестве параметра parseTree. Затем
   получаем ссылки на левого и правого потомков, чтобы убедиться в их
   существовании. В строке 9 идёт следующий рекурсивный вызов. Мы начинаем с
   поиска оператора в корне дерева, которым в данном случае является +. Он
   отображается как вызов функции operator.add, принимающей два параметра.
   Традиционно для вызова функции первым, что сделает Python, станет
   вычисление переданных в функцию параметров. В нашем случае оба они -
   рекурсивные вызовы evaluate. Вычисляя слева направо, сначала выполнится
   левый рекурсивный вызов, куда передано левое поддерево. Мы обнаружим, что
   этот узел не имеет потомков, следовательно, является листом. Поэтому
   хранящееся в нём значение просто вернётся, как результат вычисления. В
   данном случае это будет целое число 3.

   К настоящему моменту у нас есть один параметр, вычисленный для верхнего
   вызова operator.add. Но мы ещё не закончили. Продолжая вычислять параметры
   слева направо, сделаем рекурсивный вызов для правого поддерева корня.
   Обнаружив, что у него есть и правый, и левый потомки, ищем оператор,
   хранящийся в узле, ('*') и вызываем для него функцию, передавая в неё
   левого и правого потомков в качестве параметров. В этой точке вычисления
   оба рекурсивных вызова вернут листья - целые 4 и 5, соответственно. Имея
   их, вернём результат operator.mul(4,5). Теперь у нас есть все операнды для
   верхнего оператора +, и остаётся просто вызвать operator.add(3,20).
   Результат вычисления дерева для выражения \((3 + (4 * 5))\) равен 23.

                      Африканское дерево баобаб (Намибия)

   Де́рево (лат. árbor) (в качестве ботанического термина используется во
   множественном числе — дере́вья), а также, в более узком смысле
   деревяни́стые или древесные расте́ния — одна из главных и самых крупных
   жизненных форм растений. Дерево имеет отчётливо выраженный многолетний
   одревесневший ствол, сохраняющийся в течение всей его жизни. Это — главная
   ось дерева, вокруг которой развивается крона второстепенных ветвей (за
   исключением пальм, которые не дают боковых веток).

   Любое дерево состоит из корня, ствола и кроны. По типу листвы различают
   хвойные и лиственные, вечнозелёные и листопадные деревья. Иногда бывают
   деревья безлистные (таков случай многих кактусов). По месту произрастания
   деревья могут быть тропическими, субтропическими, северными, тундровыми,
   болотными, горными, этот список можно продолжать. По своему значению (или
   применению) деревья бывают также плодовыми, ценными (с точки зрения
   древесины), корабельными... Большое пространство, густо поросшее
   деревьями, называется лесом.

Дерево в научно-популярной литературе и публицистике[править]

     *   Плотник @lt;выбрав дерево@gt;, протягивает по нему линию, остроконечным    
         орудием делает на нём очертание, потом обделывает его резцом и       
         округляет его, и выделывает из него образ человека красивого вида,   
         чтобы поставить его в доме. Он рубит себе кедры, берет сосну и дуб,  
         которые выберет между деревьями в лесу, садит ясень, а дождь         
         возращает его. И это служит человеку топливом, и @lt;часть@gt; из этого    
         употребляет он на то, чтобы ему было тепло, и разводит огонь, и      
         печёт хлеб. И из того же делает бога, и поклоняется ему, делает      
         идола, и повергается перед ним. Часть дерева сожигает в огне, другою 
         частью варит мясо в пищу, жарит жаркое и ест досыта, а также греется 
         и говорит: «хорошо, я согрелся; почувствовал огонь». А из остатков   
         от того делает бога, идола своего, поклоняется ему, повергается      
         перед ним и молится ему, и говорит: «спаси меня, ибо ты бог мой».    
         @lt;...@gt; И не возьмет он этого к своему сердцу, и нет у него столько    
         знания и смысла, чтобы сказать: «половину его я сжёг в огне и на     
         угольях его испек хлеб, изжарил мясо и съел; а из остатка его сделаю 
         ли я мерзость? буду ли поклоняться куску дерева?»                    
         — Библия, Книга пророка Исаии, 44: 13-19                             

     *   Видения же головы моей на ложе моём были такие: я видел, вот, среди  
         земли дерево весьма высокое. Большое было это дерево и крепкое, и    
         высота его достигала до неба, и оно видимо было до краев всей земли. 
         Листья его прекрасные, и плодов на нём множество, и пища на нём для  
         всех; под ним находили тень полевые звери, и в ветвях его гнездились 
         птицы небесные, и от него питалась всякая плоть. И видел я в         
         видениях головы моей на ложе моём, и вот, нисшёл с небес             
         Бодрствующий и Святый. Воскликнув громко, Он сказал: «срубите это    
         дерево, обрубите ветви его, стрясите листья с него и разбросайте     
         плоды его; пусть удалятся звери из-под него и птицы с ветвей его; но 
         главный корень его оставьте в земле, и пусть он в узах железных и    
         медных среди полевой травы орошается небесною росою, и с животными   
         пусть будет часть его в траве земной»...                             
         — Библия, «Книга пророка Даниила», 4: 7-12                           

     *   Берегитесь лжепророков, которые приходят к вам в овечьей одежде, а   
         внутри суть волки хищные. По плодам их узнаете их. Собирают ли с     
         терновника виноград, или с репейника смоквы? Так всякое дерево       
         доброе приносит и плоды добрые, а худое дерево приносит и плоды      
         худые. Не может дерево доброе приносить плоды худые, ни дерево худое 
         приносить плоды добрые. Всякое дерево, не приносящее плода доброго,  
         срубают и бросают в огонь. Итак по плодам их узна́ете их.            
         — Евангелие от Матфея, 7: 15-20                                      

     *   Природа дерева такова, что оно любит металл, следуя справедливости.  
         Чувства металла таковы, что, проявляя гуманность и нежность, в       
         дерево он влюблён.                                                   
         Так друг друга они втягивают, друг друга поглощают, родство обретая; 
         Тогда становится ясно, что мужчина понёс во чреве.^[1]^:277          
         — Чжан Бо-дуань, «Главы о прозрении истины», 1078                    

     *   Но тем не менее мысль, что во всем виновато «общество», очень        
         хорошая мысль. Жаль только, что Иван Сергеевич недостаточно          
         вразумительно объясняет своим почитателям значение таинственного     
         слова «общество», а это, по моему мнению, оттого происходит, что он  
         вообще действует как-то не прямо, а больше посредством фигур и       
         уподоблений. Всё-то и выходит у него какое-то величественное дерево, 
         которое верхушкой упирается в небо, а корнями высасывает из земли    
         соки. Дерево это прообразует общество, верхушка ― вероятно, разную   
         этакую устроительную выспренность (земский собор), сосущие корни ―   
         вероятно, прожорливость, а земля… земля-то что означает? Признаюсь,  
         я видал на своем веку довольно таких деревьев, но они меня очень     
         мало соблазняли. Не знаю почему, но мне всегда казалось, что они     
         берут из земли соки затем только, чтобы, напитавшись вдоволь, вести  
         с небом разговор о разных душеспасительных материях. Неблагодарные,  
         находясь столь близко от светозарного Феба, совершенно забывают о    
         земле-кормилице и думают, что в таком важном соседстве им следует    
         заниматься интересами высокими, так сказать, небесными, а не теми,   
         которые копошатся где-то там, в земле… Но допустим, наконец, что все 
         эти мечтания совершились в очию, что у нас есть дерево-общество,     
         которое вершиной упирается в небо, а корнями в землю, ― что выйдет   
         из этого? Боюсь сказать, но думаю, что из этого выйдет новый манер   
         питания соками земли ― и ничего больше. Твердят нам, что нынешнее    
         русское дерево-общество виновато тем, что оно корнями своими не      
         упирается в землю, что корни эти находятся где-то на воздухе… гм… да 
         ведь это, право, было бы еще не так дурно! ведь это просто означало  
         бы, что общество живет и ничего лишнего не берет!^[2]                
         — Михаил Салтыков-Щедрин, «Наша общественная жизнь», 1863-1864       

     *   Жизнь и смерть для человека, имеющего дело непосредственно с         
         природой, слиты почти воедино. Вот умерло срубленное дерево, оно     
         вянет, гниет, но в то же самое мгновение пополняется новой жизнью.   
         Под гниющей корой неведомо откуда явились и копошатся тысячи червей, 
         муравьев; все это суетится, лазает, точит, ест мертвеца, тащит в     
         свой дом, строится, устраивает муравьиные кучи, растаскивает его по  
         мельчайшим частям, как у бобыля шапку, полушубок, и, глядишь, нет    
         дерева, а есть что-то другое, и не мертвое, а живое; дерево          
         рассыпалось, и на том месте, где оно лежало, по всей его длине,      
         вырос крепкий мох, разнообразный, красивый, и в нем после хорошего   
         «грибного дождя» (для грибов бывает особенный грибной дождь) ― масса 
         грибов, которые через день по появлении жарятся на сковороде в       
         сметане…^[3]

     *   Много есть на свете прекрасных деревьев, и много прекрасного есть в  
         каждом дереве для человека, у которого есть орган для чувства        
         прекрасного. В сфере этой деревенской красоты не забудьте бука.      
         Красота бука совсем оригинальная. Она почти вся в стволе, в пне.     
         — Евгений Марков, «Очерки Крыма (Картины крымской жизни, природы и   
         истории)», 1902                                                      

     *   У таких вероисповедников всякое дерево в заповедных рощах,           
         поваленное бурей, считается признаком несчастья для ближайшего       
         окольного люда. Деревья в них с нависшими ягелями, украшающими их    
         наподобие висячих бород, тоже попали, в качестве избранников, в      
         религиозный культ и воспламенили воображение сказочников. Подобного  
         рода деревьями, покрытыми до самой вершины мхом, и в самом деле      
         оживляющими угрюмые хвойные леса, придавая им в то же время          
         внушительный вид долговечности и обилия — украшаются жилища и        
         владения богов и их избранников и любимцев – храбрых и могучих       
         богатырей. Той же участи удостоилась в особенности ель, вообще       
         стоя́щая, по своим внутренним качествам, ниже сосны, но наружным     
         видом выражающая высшую степень строгости, спокойствия и             
         торжественности. Впрочем, среди православного русского люда место    
         ели, по необъяснимым причинам, и едва ли не по простой случайности,  
         заступили другие деревья и преимущественно сосна. Практическому      
         великорусскому племени пришлись по вкусу сухие сосновые боры, как    
         наиболее удобные места для жительства. Поэтому и выбор священных     
         деревьев, естественным образом, стал падать на сосны. От постройки   
         часовен с постановкою в них образов зависело то обстоятельство, что  
         известные участки сосновых лесов становились через то священными, в  
         смысле недозволенных к вырубке, обязательных к охранению,            
         заповедных. От явлений св. икон (исключительно Богоматери) на        
         ветвях, или у корней деревьев, подобно Костромской, Федоровской и    
         Курской Коренной, самые деревья признавались святыми, но уже не в    
         охранительном смысле заповедных, а таких, из которых сооружались     
         престолы алтарей, созидаемые на местах явлений. В южной части        
         Череповецкого уезда обращает на себя внимание обилие таких сосновых  
         рощ, где часовни являются показателями полного запрещения вырубок, и 
         в трёх волостях заповедь эта усилена ещё тем, что здесь не           
         дозволяются хороводы и всякие сходки для каких-либо весёлых          
         развлечений. За срубленное дерево, или осквернение чем-нибудь всей   
         рощи предполагается скорое и несомненное возмездие, в виде слепоты и 
         иных болезней, и даже смерти.^[4]

     *   Всё, что есть в нас еврейского, дано нам Палестиной; всё остальное,  
         что в нас имеется, не есть еврейское. Еврейство и Палестина — одно и 
         то же. Там мы родились как нация и там созрели. И когда буря         
         выбросила нас из Палестины, мы не могли расти дальше, как не может   
         расти дальше дерево, вырванное из земли.                             
         — Владимир Жаботинский, «Сионизм и Эрец Исраэль», 1904               

     *   Даст ли дерево хороший урожай? Хорошо ли плоды раскинуты по ветвям?  
         Хорошо ли висит зелёный плод, сопротивляется ли он ветру и           
         встряхиванию дерева? Какое сопротивление он оказывает болезням и     
         гниению? Это лишь некоторые из многих вопросов, которые я должен     
         поставить и на которые плод должен хорошо ответить, иначе он не      
         выдерживает экзамена. @lt;…@gt; Вопрос за вопросом, проба за пробой, опыт  
         за опытом — принятие, условное согласие, сомнение, отказ — плод      
         должен удовлетворять не одному и не двум, а целому десятку,          
         пятидесяти, сотне требований; если этого нет, то он выходит из       
         соревнования. И не следует думать, что это работа на два-три года. Я 
         уже двенадцать лет работал над одной нектариной, которая, как я      
         надеюсь, лишь в этом году будет настолько крупной, что я смогу её    
         выпустить в свет.^[5]

     *   Растут деревья-гиганты, существуют деревья-чудеса. То секвойя        
         величиной чуть ли не с Эйфелеву башню, так, что человек у ее         
         подножия кажется муравьем, то священный фикус, у которого двести     
         стволов, а крона одна, то эвкалипт, постоянно меняющий кожу, то      
         магнолия, производящая огромные, из тончайшего белого фарфора цветы, 
         а там разные пальмы, дынные, хлебные, кофейные, хинные, коричные,    
         камфарные, каучуковые, пробковые, красные, железные, черные,         
         ореховые, винные, гранатовые, благословенно-добрые и                 
         смертельно-ядовитые деревья. Каждое дерево чем-нибудь полезно,       
         каждое дерево красиво ― одно цветами, другое листвой, третье осанкой 
         и ростом, четвертое цветом ствола, коры. Есть деревья красно-бурые и 
         серые, черные и зеленые, узловатые и гладкие, мохнатые и голые. Но   
         нет на свете дерева белого, как летнее облако в синеве, как ромашка  
         в зелени луга, как снег, когда он только что выпал и еще непривычен  
         для глаз, смотревших до сих пор на черную ненастную землю. Мы        
         присмотрелись, привыкли, но если разобраться, то во всем зеленом     
         царстве нет подобного дерева, оно одно. Нельзя сказать, что          
         единственное качество ― белизна. С давних пор у этого дерева большая 
         дружба с человеком.^[6]

     *   Прежде всякого взгляда, прежде всего видимого и невидимого, в        
         человеческом мире существует нечто главное. То, что отпечатано       
         заранее на живой ткани и затем вырезано перочинным ножичком на       
         морщинистой коре сознания. Согласно этой картине, дерево ― это       
         прежде всего ― структура и форма, отпечатанная в самых глубоких      
         слоях. Я повторяю: высеченная структура и форма. Высеченная на       
         стенках черепа человеческого ― форма и структура (сознания) дерева,  
         в тех редчайших случаях, когда оно есть. @lt;...@gt; Но это ещё бы         
         полбеды. Остаётся ещё и самое главное... дерево. То, которое         
         упирается своими корнями в подстилку, а жёсткими ветвями на ветру    
         этого неприветливого мира царапает ― мякоть свода. Однако о нём, об  
         этом главном я скажу немного позже. ― Вон там, за тем чёрным

Дерево в мемуарах и художественной прозе[править]

     *   Эраст не знает сам, что происходит в душе его, целует каждое дерево, 
         твердит бесценное ему имя Нины и находит на коре одного дерева своё  
         и её имя, соединённые гирляндой с подписью: «Симпатией и небом!»     
         «Это её рука вырезала! ― закричал он в совершенном исступлении. ―    
         Здесь, подле этого дерева должно умереть мне!^[8]

     *   Кое-где лежат по лесу огромные стволы, сначала высохших, потом       
         подгнивших у корня и, наконец, сломленных бурею дубов, лип, берез и  
         осин. При своем падении они согнули и поломали молодые соседние      
         деревья, которые, несмотря на свое уродство, продолжают расти и      
         зеленеть, живописно искривясь набок, протянувшись по земле или       
         скорчась в дугу. Трупы лесных великанов, тлея внутри, долго          
         сохраняют наружный вид; кора их обрастает мохом и даже травою; мне   
         нередко случалось второпях вскочить на такой древесный труп и ―      
         провалиться ногами до земли сквозь его внутренность: облако гнилой   
         пыли, похожей на пыль сухого дождевика, обхватывало меня на          
         несколько секунд…^[9]

     *   От усталости он начал было дремать, как вдруг его разбудил страшный  
         рёв приближавшагося быка. Увидев в стороне несколько деревьев,       
         робкий молодой датчанин пустился наутёк и стал взбираться на одно из 
         них. Но каково было изумление его, когда он услышал, что дерево      
         начало испускать нежные, но высокие звуки, подобные крикам           
         раздражённой женщины. Но то-ли было ещё, когда дерево оттолкнуло     
         его, ловко влепив ему полновесную пощечину. Ошеломлённый, он упал и, 
         казалось, готов был испустить дух. Со всех сторон послышались глухие 
         вопли и безчисленное множество деревьев и кустарников приближается к 
         Ниэлю Климу и окружает его. Не понимая их языка, он очень хорошо     
         однако ж понял, что они находятся в сильнейшем негодовании, причина  
         которого была очень проста.                                          
         Планета Назар, находящаяся в центре того мира, в который он вступил, 
         обитаема Деревьями. По роковой случайности, Дерево, на которое он    
         хотел было взобраться, спасаясь от быка, оказалось супругою          
         правителя соседняго города. Беда была-бы не велика, будь это         
         обыкновенная женщина; но в настоящем случае преступление усиливалось 
         званием оскорблённой. Взобраться на матрону такого звания — дело не  
         шуточное, в особенности у народа, гордящагося чистотою своих нравов. 
         И так, нашего путешественника арестовали и отвели в город.           
         Деревья-люди не выше нас ростом. Они не имеют корней, а только две   
         чрезвычайно короткия ноги, отчего и двигаются они черепашьим ходом.  
         Вскоре мы увидим, на высоту каких почестей человеческия ноги         
         вознесли Николая Климиуса, или Ниэля Клима.                          
         Вообще Деревья не отличаются быстрым соображением, так что Ниэля     
         Клима признали невиновным только несколько месяцев спустя после его  
         ареста.

     *   Вот сестра дожидалася его много, много годов, а его всё нет! — и

         доставать птицу-говорунью, дерево певучее и живой воды; шла она      
         много ли, мало ли времени и пришла в лес. Сидит на дереве старый

     *   ― Эге, это я знаю! Хорошо знаю, как дерево говорит… Дерево, хлопче,  
         тоже боится… Вот осина, проклятое дерево, все что-то лопочет, ― и    
         ветру нет, а она трясется. Сосна на бору в ясный день играет-звенит, 
         а чуть подымется ветер, она загудит и застонет. Это еще ничего… А ты 
         вот слушай теперь. Я хоть глазами плохо вижу, а ухом слышу: дуб      
         зашумел, дуба уже трогает на поляне… Это к буре. Действительно, куча 
         невысоких коряжистых дубов, стоявших посредине поляны и защищенных   
         высокою стеною бора, помахивала крепкими ветвями, и от них несся     
         глухой шум, легко отличаемый от гулкого звона сосен. @lt;...@gt; А вот,    
         все равно, как и теперь: сначала сосна застонет на бору… То звенит,  
         а то стонать начнет: о́- ох-хо-о… о́- хо-о! ― и затихнет, а потом    
         опять, потом опять, да чаще, да жалостнее. Эге, потому что много ее  
         повалит хозяин ночью.^[12]

     *   По мере приближения к Сихотэ-Алиню строевой лес исчезает все больше  
         и больше и на смену ему выступают леса поделочного характера, и      
         наконец в самых истоках растёт исключительно замшистая и жидкая ель  
         (Picea ajanensis Fisch.), лиственница (Larix sibirica Lbd.) и пихта  
         (Abies nephrolepis Maxim.). Корни деревьев не углубляются в землю, а 
         стелются на поверхности. Сверху они чуть-чуть только прикрыты мхами. 
         От этого деревья недолговечны и стоят непрочно. Молодняк             
         двадцатилетнего возраста свободно опрокидывается на землю усилиями   
         одного человека. Отмирание деревьев происходит от вершин. Иногда     
         умершее дерево продолжает еще долго стоять на корню, но стоит до     
         него слегка дотронуться, как оно тотчас же обваливается и            
         рассыпается в прах. При подъёме на крутые горы, в особенности с      
         ношей за плечами, следует быть всегда осторожным. Надо внимательно   
         осматривать деревья, за которые приходится хвататься. Уже не говоря  
         о том, что при падении такого рухляка сразу теряешь равновесие, но,  
         кроме того, обломки сухостоя могут еще разбить голову. У берез       
         древесина разрушается всегда скорее, чем кора. Труха из них          
         высыпается, и на земле остаются лежать одни берестяные футляры.      
         Такие леса всегда пустынны. Не видно нигде звериных следов, нет      
         птиц, не слышно жужжания насекомых. Стволы деревьев в массе имеют    
         однотонную буро-серую окраску. Тут нет подлеска, нет даже            
         папоротников и осок. Куда ни глянешь, всюду кругом мох: и внизу под  
         ногами, и на камнях, и на ветвях деревьев. Тоскливое чувство         
         навевает такая тайга. В ней всегда стоит мёртвая тишина, нарушаемая  
         только однообразным свистом ветра по вершинам сухостоев. В этом шуме 
         есть что-то злобное, предостерегающее. Такие места удэгейцы считают  
         обиталищами злых духов.^[13]

         больше осмол. Подсечка деревьев насмерть. Это способ добывания       
         скипидара. С точки зрения дерева ― это ритуальное убийство. Так вот, 
         лён. Лён, если бы он имел голос, кричал при обработке. Его дергают   
         из земли, взяв за голову. С корнем. Сеют его густо, чтобы угнетал    
         себя и рос чахлым и неветвистым. Лён нуждается в угнетении. Его

     *   ― Смотрите, смотрите! ― снова крикнула миссис Адамс. На этот раз     
         пришлось посмотреть не вниз, а вверх. Рядом с нами подымался из      
         земли ствол другого гигантского дерева. Не удивительно, что мы не    
         сразу его заметили. Он был слишком велик, слишком ненормален среди   
         обычных стволов окружавших его елей и сосен, чтобы глаз, воспитанный 
         на естественной разнице между маленьким и большим, мог бы сразу      
         отметить этот феномен. Мы медленно поехали дальше, от дерева к       
         дереву. Оказалось, что первые два, перед которыми мы остановились в  
         изумлении, были самыми маленькими экземплярами. Теперь мы ехали по   
         древнему сумрачному лесу, фантастическому лесу, где слово «человек»  
         перестает звучать гордо, а гордо звучит лишь одно слово ― «дерево».  
         Секвойи, принадлежащие, по мирному выражению ученых, «к семейству    
         хвойных», растут по соседству с обыкновенными елями и соснами и      
         поражают человека так, будто он увидел среди кур и поросят живого    
         птеродактиля или мамонта. Самому большому дереву четыре тысячи лет.  
         Называется оно «Генерал Шерман». Американцы ― люди чрезвычайно       
         практичные. Возле «Шермана» висит табличка, где с величайшей         
         точностью сообщается, что из одного этого дерева можно построить     
         сорок домов, по пяти комнат в каждом доме, и что если это дерево     
         положить рядом с поездом «Юнион Пасифик», то оно окажется длиннее    
         поезда. А глядя на дерево, на весь этот прозрачный и темный лес, не  
         хотелось думать о пятикомнатных квартирах и поездах «Юнион Пасифик». 
         Хотелось мечтательно произносить слова Пастернака: «В лесу клубился  
         кафедральный мрак» ― и стараться как можно спокойней представить     
         себе, что это «семейство хвойных» мирно росло, когда на свете не     
         было не только Колумба, но и Цезаря, и Александра Македонского, и    
         даже египетского царя Тутанхаммона.^[15]

     *   Пётр Иванович, что мог, рассказал нам про сборку живицы.             
         — Когда сосне наносится какая бы ни было рана, дерево в виде         
         самозащиты заливает ее соком, который на воздухе быстро густеет, из  
         прозрачного становится белым и закупоривает рану. Точно так же,      
         свертываясь, закупоривает рану и кровь. Живица – не смола (многие    
         называют ее так), а именно живица, заживляющая дерево. Смолу же      
         добывают из корней сосны или осмола путем сухой перегонки. Итак,     
         раненое дерево выделяет живицу, которая вскоре застывает. Значит,    
         чтобы добыть много живицы, нужно наносить все новые и новые раны.    
         Этим и занимаются вздымщики. Орудие вздымщика — хак той или иной     
         системы — как нельзя лучше приспособлено для этого. Вот подошел      
         человек к сосне, зачистил слегка шершавую кору (операция называется  
         «окорение»), нацелился хаком и резким умелым движением прорезал      
         вдоль ствола узкий глубокий желоб полутораметровой длины. По этому   
         желобу будет стекать живица. От длинного желоба под острым углом     
         вздымщик прорезывает два коротких желоба — усы, внизу прикрепляет    
         железный колпачок — приемник живицы. Через три дня вздымщик придет к 
         дереву снова. Пониже старых ран он прорежет новые. Так весь сезон    
         дерево не знает покоя.^[16]

     *   Бывает, какое-нибудь дерево заденут нечаянно, сдерут с него кору, а  
         то по стволу и топором ударят, и к пораненному месту тут же сразу    
         начинает поступать смола. Дерево само ее гонит, само лечит себя…     
         Даже если и совсем его спилят… То есть когда уж один пенек           
         останется… Не все, может, знают, как старые эти пни корчуют… @lt;...@gt; И 
         из живицы той, что бежит по живой сосне ― может, видели, бывают      
         такие желобки и стрелы вырезаны на соснах? ― и из нее тоже камфару   
         получить можно. Живица оживляет… Даже когда человеку вовсе плохо,

     *   Если где-то в лесу погибает от старости одно дерево, оно, прежде чем 
         умереть, отдаёт на ветер столько семян, и столько новых деревьев     
         вырастает вокруг на земле, близко и далеко, что старому дереву,      
         особенно рододендрону, ― а ведь рододендрон, Вета Аркадьевна, это,   
         наверное, огромное дерево с листьями величиной с небольшой таз, ―    
         умирать не обидно. И дереву безразлично, оно растёт там, на          
         серебристом холме, или новое, выросшее из его семени. Нет, дереву не 
         обидно. И траве, и собаке, и дождю.^[18]

     *   Дерево стало валиться, а он по чистой случайности оказался в тот     
         момент на той стороне, куда заваливалось, сокрушая всё вокруг, это   
         поверженное дерево-гигант. Все закричали в голос: ― Берегись!        
         Эмрайин оцепенел от неожиданности, и было уже поздно: треща,         
         громыхая рвущейся кроной, обрушивая и опрокидывая само небо, вырывая 
         кусок зелёного лесного потолка вверху, дерево медленно и неумолимо   
         падало на него. И он подумал в то мгновение лишь об одном, что       
         Кириск ― тогда он был малышом и единственным ребёнком, Псулк ещё не  
         родилась, ― он подумал тогда, в те считанные секунды, на пороге      
         неминуемой смерти, подумал только об этом, и ни о чём другом он не   
         успел подумать, что сын ― это то, что будет им после него. Дерево    
         рухнуло рядом, с грозным гулом, обдав его волной листьев и пыли. И   
         тут все облегчённо вскричали.^[19]

     *   Каждое дерево шумит ― даже в пору безветрия. И у каждого свой,       
         особый шум. Но лес, бывает, так соединит все шумы, так их            
         перемешает, что получится полная тишина. Лесная особая тишина.^[20]

     *   Кроме того, Гениалиссимус представляет собой как бы могучее дерево,  
         выросшее из отживших своё побегов. Как дерево влагу, Гениалиссимус   
         впитал в себя и переработал всё лучшее, что было создано             
         предварительной литературой, после чего потребность в последней      
         совершенно отпала.^[21]

         зелено по-своему.^[22]

     *   Листья желтеют, опадают, потом вырастают новые. Впрочем, разве мы    
         знаем, ― возможно, когда лист желтеет и падает, дерево тоже          
         страдает. Или когда лист проедает гусеница. Почему мы так уж         
         уверены, что дереву не больно?^[22]                                  
         — Анатолий Эфрос, «Профессия: режиссёр», 1987                        

     *   Интересно наблюдать, как возникает и растёт от репетиции к репетиции 
         нечто живое. Похоже на то, как в начале мая внезапно появляются на   
         ветках зелёные листочки. Кажется невероятным, что дерево за два-три  
         дня преобразуется до неузнаваемости. Вдруг что-то запестрело,        
         удесятерилось, ещё размножилось, и дом напротив уже не виден.^[22]

           С Росою грозно встал                       
           Над деревом столетий                       
           Мгновения металл.^[34]                     
           — Борис Божнев, «Скорбь 2 — утешь 4», 1939 

     *     И хоть вокруг ни сошки нету,                       
           От печки той одной ― нет-нет,                      
           Повеет деревом согретым,                           
           Прокопченным за много лет.^[35]                    
           — Александр Твардовский, «На старом дворище», 1939

Комментарии[править]

    1. ↑ В языческой и затем религиозной мифологии дерево всегда занимало
       важное место, чаще всего — как символ развития, роста, трудности или
       спасения. Кроме сказочного «дерева певучего и живой воды» можно было
       бы привести очень длинный список мифологических деревьев, главные из
       которых: древо жизни, древо познания, дерево мира, космическое древо,
       а также многочисленные родовые древа, славянские древа и всецелое
       древо человечества.
    2. ↑ «На древе человечества высоком ты лучшим был его листом» — это
       стихотворение Фёдор Тютчев посвятил Гёте в год его смерти.

Самые уникальные деревья в природе

   Наша природа обладает невероятной фантазией, создавая миллионы видов
   растений и животных. Нескольких человеческих жизней не хватит, чтобы
   увидеть всех представителей флоры и фауны. Но человеку всегда было
   интересно узнавать о чём-то новом и необычном, поэтому сегодня мы хотели
   бы рассказать вам о нескольких самых удивительных деревьях, произрастающих
   в разных уголках нашей планеты:

  Радужный эвкалипт

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Кора этого дерева будто разрисована умелым художником. Эвкалипты – вообще
   удивительные деревья: самыми высокими деревьями, обнаруженными когда-либо
   на нашей планете, являлись именно эвкалипты. К примеру, в одном из
   отчетов, датированном 1872-ым годом, говорится об упавшем эвкалипте,
   высота которого равнялась 150-ти метрам.

    

  Дерево Жизни

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   В числе всех упомянутых здесь представителей флоры эта акация является
   сравнительно молодым деревом – ей “всего” 400 лет. Уникальность
   чудо-дерева в том, что оно выросло прямо посреди пустыни в Бахрейне, и как
   оно не только выжило, но и растёт в условиях острого дефицита воды – до
   сих пор является неразгаданной учёными загадкой.

  Баобаб

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   У этих деревьев отсутствуют кольца, благодаря которым можно определять
   возраст растения. Учёные делают это с помощью радиоуглеродного анализа.

  Драконник, или Драконово дерево

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Это дерево имеет ещё одно название – дерево драконовой крови: если в коре
   сделать надрез, то в этом месте мгновенно выступит красный сок.

  Сейбы (хлопковые деревья) в Ангкор-Ват

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Они произрастают на руинах древнего храма Ангкор-Ват (Камбоджа), а их
   корневая система уже давно стала единым целым с каменными постройками
   храмового комплекса. Само по себе дерево из семейства пальмовых интересно
   и необычно тем, что, произрастая преимущественно в засушливых регионах,
   оно удерживает нужную для жизни влагу с помощью слоя колючек, которые
   покрывают весь ствол и ветви.

  Баобаб-чайник

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   А вот все 6 видов баобаба, произрастающего на Мадагаскаре, могут принять
   форму бутылки или чайника. Скорее всего, это можно объяснить дефицитом
   влаги в этих широтах и способностью дерева позаботиться о ней.

  Сосна Мафусаила

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Некоторым необычным деревьям иногда присваиваются имена собственные. Чаще
   всего этому способствует огромный возраст, необычный внешний вид или
   колоссальные размеры. Одним из таких деревьев можно назвать межгорную
   остистую сосну Мафусаила, которую обнаружили в 1953-ем году в Национальном
   лесу Инио в восточной части Калифорнии (США). Это уникальное дерево
   является одним из самых древних живых деревьев на нашей планете. Согласно
   экспертам, приблизительный возраст дерева по состоянию на этот год равен
   4845 годам.

  Дерево Туле

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Уникальность дерева из семейства таксодиумов, произрастающего возле церкви
   городка Санта-Мария-дель-Туле (штат Оахака, Мексика), состоит в том, что
   оно имеет самый толстый в мире ствол – чуть больше 36 метров в окружности
   и почти 12 метров в диаметре (по состоянию на 2005-ый год). Согласно
   различным версиям, примерный возраст этого дерева – 1500-6000 лет.

  Оливковое дерево Элайя Буйбон

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Оно является самым древним оливковым деревом. Произрастает на острове Крит
   (Греция) и, несмотря на свой почтенный возраст (около 4000 лет), всё ещё
   плодоносит.

  Дуб Ангела

                       Самые уникальные деревья в природе
   Еще одно дерево с собственным именем: ему 1500 лет, и произрастает оно на
   острове Джона (штат Южная Каролина, США). Высота дуба Ангела равняется
   20-ти метрам, диаметр дерева – 2,7 м, а длина самой раскидистой ветви –
   около 27-ми метров. Своё название дуб получил от фамилии семьи Angel (в
   переводе с англ. – “ангел”) – последнего собственника здешних земель.

   Братеевский каскадный парк (30.12.2021)

   Новогоднее дерево — настоящее или символическое дерево, наряжаемое
   специально к Новому году. Традиции новогоднего дерева существуют на
   территории бывшего СССР, как советской альтернативы Рождеству, а также в
   Азии.

   В России и других странах бывшего социалистического лагеря изначально
   возникла как Ёлка к Рождеству и переняла большую часть традиций от неё.
   Существует не только в России, но и в других государствах и странах, где
   Рождество традиционно не празднуется, например в Турции, Вьетнаме, Японии.
   Считается главным символом Нового года.

Новогодняя ёлка в России и СССР[править | править код]

  Рождественская ель в Российской империи[править | править код]

   [IMG]Демонстрация против Рождества и ёлки в 1929 году

   Обычай украшать дома на новый год хвойными деревьями появился в России по
   указу Петра I при переходе на летоисчисление от Рождества Христова в канун
   1700 года (до этого новый год в России отмечался от сотворения мира 1
   сентября)  — «перед воротами учинить некоторые украшения из древ и ветвей
   сосновых, елевых и можжевелевых», «людям скудным каждому хоть по деревцу
   или ветке над воротами или над хороминой своей поставить», а также
   «учинить трижды стрельбу и выпустить несколько ракет, сколько у кого
   случится». Ещё до революции 1917 года сложился обычай праздновать
   Рождество, наряжая ёлку и проводя детский праздник. Однако забава эта была
   недешёвой и доступной лишь для детей в обеспеченных семьях.

  Новогодняя Ёлка в СССР[править | править код]

   С конца 1920-х годов в России рождественская ёлка оказалась под
   фактическим запретом как «буржуазный», «поповский» и антисоветский обычай.
   Рождественская ёлка была под запретом больше 5 лет.

     Под «Рождество Христово» в обед
     Старорежимный ёлочный дед
     С длинной-предлинной такой бородой
     Вылитый сказочный «Дед-Мороз»
     С ёлкой под мышкой саночки вёз,
     Санки с ребёнком годочков пяти.
     Советского тут ничего не найти!

   В СССР ёлка как атрибут праздника — уже не рождественского, а
   новогоднего — была возвращена в 1935 году по решению И. В. Сталина,
   который поручил партийному деятелю П. П. Постышеву выступить по этому
   вопросу в печати.

     «Не помню года и тем более месяца, но вот однажды позвонил мне Сталин и
     говорит: “Приезжайте в Кремль. Прибыли украинцы, поедете с ними по
     Москве, покажете город”. @lt;…@gt; Вышли мы, сели в машину Сталина.
     Поместились все в одной. Ехали и разговаривали. @lt;…@gt; Постышев поднял
     тогда вопрос: “Товарищ Сталин, вот была бы хорошая традиция и народу
     понравилась, а детям особенно принесла бы радость — рождественская ёлка.
     Мы это сейчас осуждаем. А не вернуть ли детям ёлку?” Сталин поддержал
     его: “Возьмите на себя инициативу, выступите в печати с предложением
     вернуть детям ёлку, а мы поддержим”. Так это и произошло. Постышев
     выступил в “Правде”, другие газеты подхватили идею»Н. С. Хрущёв

   28 декабря 1935 года в газете «Правда» на третьей странице вышла короткая
   статья ^[1] П. П. Постышева, в которой нападки на ёлку были названы «левым
   загибом» и «следует этому неправильному осуждению ёлки, которая является
   прекрасным развлечением для детей, положить конец».

   Первую организованную официальными советскими властями ёлку в СССР увидели
   жители города Харькова 30 декабря 1935 года. К новому 1937 году была
   установлена первая кремлёвская новогодняя ёлка^[2]. 

  Новогодняя ель в современной России[править | править код]

   С декабря 1996 года в России возобновилась дореволюционная традиция
   ставить ёлку в новогодние праздники на Соборной площади Московского
   Кремля^[3]. Кремлёвская ёлка выбирается по определённым стандартам: дерево
   должно быть хорошего качества, чтобы перенести температурные перепады и
   простоять, не осыпаясь, три недели, иметь ровный ствол и пушистые ветки,
   на стволе не должно быть мха и лишайников, возраст — не менее 100 лет,
   высота — около 30 метров, диаметр ствола — не менее 0,6 метра^[4].

   [IMG]Волоколамск, 2010. Синкретизм эпохи: красная звезда на фоне купола
   церкви.

   В других российских городах ёлки также устанавливают на центральных
   площадях и в популярных туристических местах. В процессе разработки
   дизайна украшения таких деревьев нередко участвуют ведущие специалисты и
   представители мира моды. Установка, украшение и зажжение центральных
   новогодних ёлок является традицией множества городов, которая в праздники
   привлекает горожан и туристов.

   В Новом 2009 году самая высокая новогодняя ель в России была поставлена в
   Красноярске на главной площади города — Театральной. Её высота — 46
   метров, диаметр основания — 19 метров, длина окружности основания — 60
   метров. По своим размерам она обогнала даже казанскую ёлку, которая
   оказалась на 6 метров ниже^[5].

Новогодняя ёлка в Турции[править | править код]

   Турецкая новогодняя ёлка, называемая «Йилбаши Агаджи» (тур. Yılbaşı
   Ağacı — дословно «дерево начала года»), так же как и русская, очень
   напоминает Рождественскую и является её прямым потомком. Как и в России,
   это преимущественно светский обычай, поскольку 95 % турок — мусульмане и
   не празднуют Рождество. Обычай наряжать ёлку на Новый год появился
   примерно в конце 1920-х годов, с переходом Турции на григорианский
   календарь.

Новогодняя ёлка в Эстонии[править | править код]

   Уже много лет в Таллине и других городах Эстонии существует порядок, когда
   после Рождества и Нового года ёлки не выбрасывают, а приносят и сдают в
   определённые места. Далее из этих ёлок собирают разнообразные скульптуры и
   в назначенный час, вместо безрадостного окончания своего пути среди
   мусорных контейнеров, новогодние ёлки ещё несколько часов служат центром
   огненного шоу — «Сжигание праздничных ёлок». Городские самоуправления
   заранее готовят эти мероприятия и всячески поощряют их. Кроме самого шоу,
   зрителей, особенно детей, часто ждут разнообразные сюрпризы, подарки и
   сладости^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]. При организации этих мероприятий большое
   внимание уделяется привлечению общества к проблемам экологии и чистоты
   жилого пространства.

   В январе 2021 года в таллинском районе Ласнамяэ было открыто 12 пунктов по
   сбору новогодних ёлок. Из них сделают покрытие для лесных дорожек в парке
   Тондираба^[10].

Новогодняя ёлка в Азербайджане[править | править код]

   В Баку рождественские ёлки стали появляться после начала нефтяного бума
   второй половины XIX века, когда в город потоком хлынули иностранцы: немцы,
   поляки, англичане, шведы и так далее. Рождественская ёлка была для них
   самым что ни на есть привычным атрибутом, который был знаком с детства.
   Русские жители Баку также придерживались своих старых традиций — в их
   домах появлялись эти ёлки, украшенные игрушками, фруктами, сладостями и
   свечами, под которыми непременно лежали подарки. С течением времени
   азербайджанская знать, не желая отставать от европейских и российских
   веяний, также начала устанавливать в своих домах рождественские ёлки.
   Конечно, традиции Рождества были им чужды, большая часть населения были
   мусульманами. Стоила доставка елей недешево, поэтому в домах простых
   горожан-мусульман традиция прижилась не так быстро; массовая же установка
   новогодних уже ёлок стала привычной лишь в послевоенное время. Самые
   первые официальные ёлки в Баку устанавливались прежде всего в зале
   Городской думы, в домах губернатора, гласных Думы, других представителей
   властей, а также в домах интеллигенции. Ставились рождественские ёлки и в
   домах православного духовенства. Очень часто ёлки устраивались для
   детей-сирот или для детей из неблагополучных семей каким-нибудь
   благотворительным обществом. Мусульманских детей на таких мероприятиях
   было не так много. Девочек — тем более. Вместе с традицией наряжать ёлку в
   Баку пришли и традиции балов-маскарадов. Причём, балы-маскарады появились
   даже не как следствие праздника Рождества, а как бы параллельно,
   независимо от него.

   На данный момент традиция ставить Новогоднюю ёлку в Азербайджане плотно
   закрепилась. Государственная новогодняя ёлка ставится на площади около
   Президентского дворца, улицы украшаются гирляндами, проводятся различные
   мероприятия, посвящённые новому году. На улицах столицы и крупных городов
   можно увидеть Новогодние ёлки в различных учреждениях и магазинах. Из-за
   тёплого климата ёлки в основной массе искусственные. Также закрепилась
   традиция и в домах ставить новогоднюю ёлку, украшать её гирляндами,
   лампочками, игрушками и свечами.

Чичилаки в Грузии[править | править код]

   [IMG]Чичилаки
   Подробнее см. Чичилаки

   Традиционным новогодним символом и украшением в Грузии выступает Чичилаки.
   Настоящий чичилаки изготавливается из прямой ветви орехового дерева,
   которую последовательно обстругивают с одного конца, оставляя тонкие
   стружки держаться на другом конце. В результате получается палка с пышной
   стружечной кроной, которая и является чичилаки. Обычная высота украшения
   50—70 сантиметров, его ставят на праздничный стол возле тарелки со
   сладостями: чурчхелой, козинаки, сухофруктами. Традиция связывает чичилаки
   с западом Грузии, с регионом Гурия^[11]. Специалисты указывают на
   древность данной традиции, связанной с прослеживаемым во многих культурах
   культом Мирового древа, символикой жизни и плодородия^[12]. С принятием
   христианства произошло переосмысление многих прежних языческих обрядов. В
   том числе на верхушке чичилаки теперь иногда устанавливают или
   выстругивают крест, а само украшение ассоциируют с бородой святителя
   Василия. Праздник этого популярного в Грузии святого по церковному
   календарю отмечается 1 января, у греков он выступает аналогом
   Санта-Клауса. Сами гурийцы держат чичилаки в доме до 19 января, а затем
   переносят в винный погреб, чтобы благодать новогоднего деревца снизошла и
   на вино^[11].

Новогоднее дерево в Японии[править | править код]

   [IMG]Традиционное кадомацу возле ворот монастыря Кампукудзи
   Подробнее см. Кадомацу

   Новогоднее дерево в Японии, называется Кадомацу (яп. 門松, букв. «сосна у
   входа»). Изготовляется обычно из сосны, а также бамбука, папоротника и
   других предметов, перевязанных соломенной верёвкой. Выставляется на улице
   перед входом в дом или квартиру. Считается приветствием божеству Нового
   года и его временным пристанищем.

   Прототипом кадомацу является живое дерево, которое выставляли во дворе
   дома во время Нового года. В разных местах это дерево называлось
   по-разному:

     * огамимацу (яп. 拝み松, сосна для преклонения)
     * кадзаримацу (яп. 飾り松, украшенная сосна)
     * иваимацу (яп. 祝い松, праздничная сосна)
     * момбаяси (яп. 門ばやし, лес у ворот)
     * монкамбасира (яп. 門神柱, божественный столб у ворот)

   Единой формы и стиля изготовления, размещения и украшения кадомацу не
   существует. Кроме сосны используют дуб, камелию, вербу, каштан, клейеру
   или бамбук. Их выставляют отдельно или в паре с другими видами деревьев.
   Место размещения кадомацу не ограничивается только входом. Ими могут
   украшать сады, комнаты, домашние алтари и так далее. Если кадомацу
   выставляют на улице, то обязательно в паре, размещая их слева и справа от
   ворот или дверей. Сверху между ними обычно вешают верёвку из рисовой
   соломы — симэнава, выступающую в качестве оберега. В закрытых помещениях
   кадомацу выставляют по одному. В большинстве случаев в центре украшения
   находятся ветки молодой сосны или другого дерева, которые размещены в три,
   пять или семь рядов. Их обрамляют листьями дафнифилума и померанцев,
   перевязывают водорослями и добавляют к подножию ветки. Украшения помещают
   в деревянные горшки.

Новогодние растения во Вьетнаме[править | править код]

   [IMG]Вишнёвые цветы [IMG]Хоа-май

   Новогодним деревом является кэйнеу, пяти—шестиметровая бамбуковая палка с
   листьями, на которую крепят разнообразные предметы, в том числе амулеты,
   оригами-рыб, ветки кактусов, петушиные перья, листья кокоса, баньяна^[13].

   В каждом доме на севере находится персик (hoa đào, хоа-дао), в центральных
   и южных районах — хоа-май (Ochna integerrima), в горных селениях — хоа-бан
   (hoa ban). На севере (ранее — в богатых домах) также иногда выставляют
   Абрикос японский, также называемый по-вьетнамски «май»^[14]. В северных и
   центральных районах на Новый год в жилых комнатах встречаются деревья
   кумквата^[15]^[16]. Его многочисленные цветы символизируют пожелание
   богатства.

   Среди других растений — разнообразные деревья-бонсай, хризантема (hoa cúc,
   хоа кук); бархатцы, вантхо (vạn thọ) — символы долгой жизни; на юге —
   целозия (mào gà), на севере — нарцисс (thủy tiên), хоа-быом (hoa bướm). В
   прошлом пожилые старались добиться того, чтобы нарциссы зацвели прямо к
   полуночи. В XXI веке выращивание мощных деревьев, буйно цветущих на
   праздник Тет — прибыльный бизнес: дерево может быть продано более чем за
   10 000 долларов США^[17], поэтому многие берут небольшие деревца в
   аренду^[18].

Новогодняя ёлка как праздничное мероприятие[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Новогодняя ёлка (мероприятие)

   Выражение «Новогодняя ёлка» также может обозначать праздничное
   мероприятие, чаще всего для детей, на котором празднуется наступление
   Нового года и/или Рождества.

   Рождественская ёлка — традиционный атрибут празднования Рождества во
   многих странах мира. Возник в раннее Новое время в германской городской
   традиции, а с XIX века получил популярность в России^[1], англосаксонском
   мире и многих других странах. Рождественская ёлка представляет собой
   хвойное дерево (ель, пихта, сосна) или искусственную его имитацию,
   украшенное гирляндами, специальными ёлочными игрушками и свечами или
   лампочками. Устанавливается на время проведения праздника в домах и на
   улицах. В советской и российской культуре аналогом служила и служит
   новогодняя ёлка.

Происхождение[править | править код]

  Праздничные деревья у европейских народов[править | править код]

   [IMG]Чичилаки — грузинское новогоднее дерево

   Среди народов Европы был широко распространён обычай установки в весенние
   праздники «майского дерева». Грузины к 31 декабря заготавливали для очага
   грабовые дрова, а праздничный стол украшали чичилаки (наструганная кудрями
   ветка орешника). В Сванетии на Новый год в доме обычно устанавливалась
   берёзка. У горских евреев молодёжь ночью в первый день весны шла в лес на
   поиск «шам агажи» («дерева-свечки»), которое срубали, разводили из него
   костер, прыгали через него и пели^[2].

   У ряда европейских народов в рождественских ритуалах использовалось
   большое полено или пень, который зажигался в очаге в Сочельник и понемногу
   сгорал в течение двенадцати дней праздника. Считалось, что бережное
   хранение кусочка такого полена в течение всего следующего года защищало
   дом от огня и молнии и приносило дому удачу. У южных славян такое полено
   называется бадняк, у скандинавов — juldlock, у французов — la bûche de
   Noël (рождественский чурбан)^[2].

   У кельтов с празднеством зимнего солнцестояния издавна была связана омела.
   Через кельтов символика омелы прочно вошла в англо-саксонскую
   культуру^[3].

  Праздничные ветви в Библии[править | править код]

   Каких-либо указаний на дерево как символ празднования Рождества Христова в
   Новом Завете нет. Описан, однако, Вход Господень в Иерусалим, когда народ
   приветствовал его с ветвями финиковой пальмы в руках (Ин. 12:12). Эта
   деталь отсылает к празднику Кущей (Суккот), во время которого используются
   пальмовые ветви лулав. Радостные ликования и восклицания этого праздника
   указывали на будущее воскресение мёртвых^[4].

   В тех славянских регионах, где пальмы не растут из-за холода, их
   замещением традиционно служила верба, отсюда Вербное воскресенье^[5]^[6].
   И сейчас в жарком климате, например, на Гавайях, пальма используется в
   качестве рождественского дерева. А во Флориде выращивается пальма Veitchia
   merrillii  (англ.) (рус., также называемая Christmas Palm tree
   (Рождественская пальма) из-за её плодов, которые становятся ярко-красными
   к декабрю^[7].

  Легенды о происхождении[править | править код]

   Популярная в Германии легенда связывает возникновение рождественской ёлки
   с именем Святого Бонифация. Согласно житию святого, чтобы показать
   германским язычникам бессилие их богов, тот срубил священный дуб Одина.
   Легенда развивает этот сюжет: на вопрос потрясённых германцев, как им
   отмечать Рождество, он указал им на маленькую ель, уцелевшую под
   рухнувшими ветвями дуба. Её вечнозелёные ветви символизируют бессмертие, а
   верхушка указывает на небеса, как место обитания Бога^[8].

   Свой вклад в идею рождественского дерева мог внести чудесный боярышник из
   аббатства Гластонбери, который цвёл дважды в году — на Рождество и весной.
   По легенде, он вырос из шипа тернового венца Иисуса Христа, принесённого
   Иосифом Аримафейским^[8].

  Средневековье и Новое время[править | править код]

   [IMG]Дети и Дед Мороз у рождественской елки
   Гравюра из немецкой книги «50 басен с картинками для детей».

   Формирование современного рождественского ритуала произошло в немецкой
   традиции уже в конце Средневековья и начале Нового времени. Рождественская
   ель восходит к «райскому дереву» предрождественской мистерии —
   театрализованной постановки, посвящённой истории грехопадения, поскольку
   24 декабря западными христианами отмечалась память Адама и Евы. В качестве
   декорации, учитывая зимнее время, использовали хвойное дерево, которое
   украшали яблоками (символ запретного плода) и вафлями или печеньем (символ
   гостии — причастия и искупления)^[9]. Реквизит и образы этой мистерии,
   аналогично рождественскому вертепу, внедрились в домашний обрядовый
   обиход^[8]^[10]^[11].

   Рождественская ель называлась у немцев «рождественским деревом»
   (нем. Weihnachtsbaum), «Христовым деревом» (Christbaum), «деревом Клауса»
   (Klausbaum). Местами (Верхняя Бавария, Пфальц, баварская Швабия,
   Вюртемберг, Гамбург) это дерево называли Paradies «рай», Paradiesgarten
   «райский сад», Christbaumgartle и т. д.^[10] Обычай украшать ёлку плодами
   и цветами связывается с поверьями о цветении и плодоношении деревьев в
   Рождественскую ночь^[1].

   По мнению Е. В. Душечкиной, рождественская ель появилась в результате
   переосмысления древних ритуалов Йоля в новой христианской трактовке^[1].
   По её словам, среди германских народов якобы существовал древний обычай
   идти на Новый год в лес, где заранее выбранную ель украшали свечами и
   цветными тряпочками, после чего вблизи или вокруг него совершались обряды.
   Со временем еловые деревца стали срубать и приносить в дом, где они
   устанавливались на столе. К деревцу прикрепляли зажжённые свечки, на него
   вешали яблоки и сладости. После крещения германских народов все эти обычаи
   и обряды начали постепенно приобретать христианский смысл, и ёлочки,
   устанавливаемые в домах, стали частью атмосферы сочельника.

   До сих пор продолжаются споры, где и когда была впервые документально
   зафиксирована установка рождественской ёлки. Достоверно известно, что при
   Мартине Буцере на Рождество 1539 года дерево с украшениями было поставлено
   в Страсбургском соборе^[12]. В документах рижского братства Черноголовых
   упоминается о похожей церемонии в канун 1510 года, причём после
   празднества дерево было сожжено. В начале XVI века Мартин Лютер также
   упомянул о том, что на Рождество в его доме было установлено дерево с
   украшениями^[13].

   Так как вопрос «первой ёлки в Европе» имеет значительное туристическое (а
   с ним и финансовое) значение, в канун Нового 2011 года между Ригой и
   Таллином разгорелся настоящий дипломатический конфликт по вопросу ёлочного
   приоритета^[14]. У эстонских исследователей нашлись аргументы того, что в
   Таллине ёлку установили на 400 лет раньше рижской, то есть ещё до первого
   упоминания самого города (1154). Мэр Риги Нил Ушаков охарактеризовал
   ситуацию как «ёлочную войну», серьёзно угрожающую коммерческим интересам
   города и страны, и пообещал найти достойный ответ агрессору^[15].

   В немецких рождественских гимнах ёлка упоминается с XVI века («O
   Tannenbaum»), тогда как в литературных источниках начинает фигурировать
   лишь к концу XVIII века^[8]. Одним из первых её упоминает Иоганн Вольфганг
   Гёте в 1774 году:

     …в воскресенье перед рождеством он вечером пошёл к Лотте и застал её
     одну. Она приводила в порядок игрушки, которые приготовила к празднику
     своим младшим братьям и сестрам. Он заговорил о том, как обрадуются
     малыши, и припомнил те времена, когда неожиданно распахнутые двери и
     зрелище нарядной ёлки с восковыми свечами, сластями и яблоками приводило
     его в невыразимый восторг.

Рождественская ёлка в России[править | править код]

  Празднование новолетия[править | править код]

   Наружное украшение зданий ветвями хвойных деревьев в России впервые было
   назначено указом Петра I о праздновании Нового года 1 января 1700 года, но
   оно не имело ничего общего с традицией вносить на Рождество дерево в дом и
   украшать его; эта традиция в Россию приходит спустя полтора века^[16].
   Единственными, кем был выслушан царский указ, стали владельцы кабаков, на
   протяжении XVIII века обозначавшие вход в заведения еловыми ветвями,
   отчего горького пьяницу прозывали «ёлкиным»^[1].

   По царскому указу от 20 (30) декабря 1699^[17], впредь предписывалось
   вести летосчисление не от Сотворения мира, а от Рождества Христова, и день
   «новолетия», до того времени отмечавшийся на Руси 1 сентября, «по примеру
   всех христианских народов» отмечать 1 января. В указе давались также
   указания по организации новогоднего праздника: пускать ракеты, зажигать
   огни и украсить столицу (тогда ещё Москву) хвоей: «По большим улицам, у
   нарочитых домов, пред воротами поставить некоторые украшения от древ и
   ветвей сосновых, еловых и мозжевелевых против образцов, каковы сделаны на
   Гостином дворе». А «людям скудным» предлагалось каждому «хотя по древцу
   или ветве на вороты или над храминою своей поставить… а стоять тому
   украшению января в первый день»^[1].

   Москва праздновала новый год по царскому указу неделю. Город украсили
   можжевеловыми, еловыми и сосновыми ветвями. Позже 1700 года считать день 1
   января за какой-то особый в России принято не было, это был один из дней
   праздничного периода Святок, его сопровождал лишь традиционный молебен «на
   новолетие».

  Появление ёлки[править | править код]

   Словом «ёлка» в России обозначаются и принесённое в дом вечнозелёное
   дерево, и праздник.

   Ёлка, в украшенном виде, олицетворяет «неувядающую благость», неумирающую
   природу, это — «рождественское дерево», калька с нем. Weihnachtsbaum.
   Второе значение этого слова — сочельник, нем. Weihnachtsabend — день ёлки,
   праздник этого дерева, танцы и игры вокруг него. Ёлка как «рождественское
   дерево» появляется в начале XIX века в домах петербургских немцев. В
   сочельник ставилась в углу гостиной маленькая настольная ёлочка, и в
   определённый час отец семейства снимал с неё покрывало.

   24 декабря 1817 года по инициативе великой княгини Александры Фёдоровны
   была устроена домашняя ёлка в личных покоях императорской семьи, Москве, а
   на следующий год — в петербургском Аничковом дворце. На Рождество 1828
   года Александра Фёдоровна, к тому времени уже императрица, организовала
   первый праздник «детской ёлки» в собственном дворце для пяти своих детей и
   племянниц — дочерей великого князя Михаила Павловича. Ёлка была
   установлена в Большой столовой дворца^[1]. В зале заранее расставлялись
   столики, на них стелились белые скатерти, на каждом столе стояла ёлочка, и
   лежали подарки. Ёлок могло быть много, пять-десять, и тогда они ещё ничем
   не были убраны. Ёлка зажигалась дважды — в сочельник и в Рождество, после
   чего её убирали. Во дворце и в домах состоятельных горожан было принято
   после праздника отдавать ёлку слугам. Всё, что находилось на ветках ёлки и
   на столе под нею, было подарками. Подарок всегда имел своего определённого
   дарителя. Обычай приписывать появление подарков сказочным существам
   появился лишь в начале XX века. В последующие годы ёлка императорской
   семьи устанавливалась в Золотой гостиной Зимнего дворца. В царствование
   Александра III ёлку проводили в течение двух дней, 24 и 25 декабря в
   Гатчинском дворце. В царствование Николая II ёлку обычно ставили в Царском
   селе, в Александровском дворце, после того, как туда переехала
   императорская семья.

   До начала 1840-х годов обычай ставить рождественскую ёлку в России не
   существовал, дворцовые ёлки были исключением. Ни А. С. Пушкин, ни
   М. Ю. Лермонтов никогда в жизни ёлки не видели: в окружавшем их дворянском
   кругу поддерживались только русские святочные традиции: святочные
   маскарады и балы. М. Ю. Лермонтов описал такой святочный праздник в драме
   «Маскарад», а А. С. Пушкин — святочное гаданье девушек, в поэме «Евгений
   Онегин». До начала 1840-х годов о ёлках в столичных домах в литературе не
   упоминается, но в начале 1840-х, как о большой новинке, уже пишут о
   продаже в кондитерских «прелестных немецких ёлок, убранных сластями,
   фонариками и гирляндами». В середине сороковых годов уже встречаются
   отдельные удивлённые упоминания, что «в русских домах принят обычай
   немецкий… украшают… деревцо как только возможно лучше, цветами и лентами,
   навешивают на ветки вызолоченные орехи. Красненькие, самые красивые
   яблоки, кисти вкусного винограда… всё это освещается множеством восковых
   свеч, прилепленных к веткам, а иногда и разноцветными фонариками». Это
   нововведение в середине 1840-х годов переживает необыкновенный подъём
   интереса, так что в конце сороковых годов в Петербурге уже повсеместно
   ставятся ёлки. Ф. М. Достоевский в рассказе «Ёлка и свадьба» 1848 года
   упоминает ёлку как нечто уже общеизвестное.

   Дальнейшее увлечение «немецким нововведением» подкреплялось модой на
   произведения немецких писателей и прежде всего на Гофмана, произведения
   которого «Щелкунчик и Мышиный король» и «Повелитель блох» были хорошо
   известны российскому читателю^[1]. Сказка Э. Т. А. Гофмана «Щелкун орехов»
   (под таким названием книга вышла на русском языке) опубликована в 1839
   году, сказки Х. К. Андерсена «Девочка с серными спичками» и «Ёлка» также,
   возможно, сыграли свою роль. Рождественская ёлка в русском доме отражала
   часть церковного обряда и объединяла вокруг себя всю семью, и это быстро
   полюбилось горожанам. Началась городская мода на ёлки. В начале 1850-х
   годов их стали продавать у Гостиного двора приезжавшие специально с ними в
   город крестьяне. Впоследствии этот сезонный промысел принадлежал финским
   крестьянам и давал им немалый приработок, потому что ёлки стоили дорого.
   Петербуржцы быстро отошли от образца маленьких немецких ёлочек и начали
   соревноваться, у кого ёлка гуще и богаче. Самые богатые ёлки убирались
   настоящими драгоценностями и ценными тканями. Так, в одной газете того
   времени упоминается «искусственная ёлка», высотой в два с половиной метра,
   «обвитая дорогой материей и лентами, верхние ветви её были украшены
   дорогими украшениями: серьгами, перстнями и кольцами, а нижние ветви
   цветами, конфетами и плодами».

   Первая публичная ёлка была организована в 1852 году в здании
   петербургского Екатерингофского вокзала. Установленная в зале вокзала
   огромная ель «одной стороной… прилегала к стене, а другая была разукрашена
   лоскутами разноцветной бумаги». Вскоре публичные ёлки начали устраивать в
   зданиях дворянских собраний, офицерских и купеческих собраний, клубах,
   театрах и других местах. В Москве с начала 1850-х годов праздники ёлки в
   зале Благородного московского собрания также стали ежегодными. Медленнее
   ёлка проникала в провинцию. В помещичьих усадьбах ещё долго держались
   традиции Святок, но постепенно «столичная немецкая забава» пришла и
   туда^[1].

   С начала XIX века известными в Петербурге специалистами в кондитерском
   деле стали выходцы из Швейцарии, ретороманцы. Им принадлежит идея
   продавать ёлки, заранее украшенные фонариками, игрушками, а также
   пряниками, пирожными, конфетами и прочими сладостями собственного
   производства. Стоили такие ёлки очень дорого (от 20 до 200 рублей
   ассигнациями), и покупать их для своих детей могли только весьма
   зажиточные родители^[1].

   Вместе с распространением и коммерциализацией ёлка становилась «статусным»
   явлением. Приглашение на ёлку детей знакомых и, соответственно, самих
   знакомых, стало возможностью показать свой вкус и зажиточность. Важно было
   не скупиться на украшения, не использовать украшения с прошлого Рождества,
   украсить дерево богатыми подарками^[1]. Ёлку украшали фруктами и
   кондитерскими «сахарными игрушками». Сладости, мёд, засахаренные фрукты
   символизировали «сладость духовных даров» и входили в общеевропейскую
   традицию празднования Рождества, согласно которой волхвы поднесли Младенцу
   в день рождения «плоды земные», означающие изобилие, плодородие,
   процветание. В России в это время ёлку украшали яблоками, мандаринами,
   сухими фруктами (абрикосами, инжиром, черносливом), медовыми пряниками. На
   ёлке зажигались свечки, укреплённые в специальных «тюльпанчиках». Традиция
   рождественского дерева соблюдалась также в том, что ёлка увенчивалась
   Вифлеемской звездой (засиявшей в небе предвестницей Рождества) и
   украшалась разными блёстками. Блеск огней и свечей на ёлке, её блестящее
   украшение символизировали сияние «благодатного света», пронизывающего мир
   после Рождества. Ёлка легко вошла в российский быт, именно потому, что она
   позволяла всей символике службы и обряда соединиться в едином зрительном
   образе и действии, в котором была занята вся семья.

   В годы общего государственного траура выходили особые постановления
   проводить ёлки скромнее, в семейном кругу, ограничивая широкое веселье.
   Такого рода постановления, носившие рекомендательный характер, выходили во
   время годичного траура в связи со смертью императора в 1855 и в 1881 гг.,
   во время Русско-турецкой войны в 1877-78 гг.; во время Первой мировой
   войны, в 1914-16 гг.

   В постановлении Синода, изданном во время войны России с Германией,
   указывалось, что отношение православной церкви к новой традиции всегда
   оставалось несколько настороженным, как к иноземному и, в своих истоках,
   языческому обычаю. В канун Рождества Синод традиционно напоминал об этом.
   Тем не менее, и в этом году ёлки ставились, и в частных домах, и в
   гимназиях, и в домах священников, устраивавших ёлки с подарками для детей
   своих прихожан. Предписание ограничивать ёлки относилось не к самому
   дереву, а именно к празднику, к «пьяной ёлке». Последнее такого рода
   указание Синода было опубликовано в канун Нового 1917 года: оно было
   напрямую связано с потерями России в войне. Но, несмотря на потери России
   в войне, это постановление оказалось чисто формальным, и ёлка в этот год
   ставилась и праздновалась как обычно, даже в императорской семье.

   Со второй половины XIX века на ёлках начали развешивать картонные игрушки:
   гирлянды, транспаранты, китайские фонарики. В конце XIX — начале XX века
   появились в продаже особые ёлочные украшения, в том числе стеклянные шары,
   сначала немецкого, затем российского производства. В 1900 году в
   Петербурге, в магазине Гебгардта и у Петто продавали ёлочные украшения:
   «бусы, снег и амуров из невоспламеняющейся ваты, обезьян, флаги, сусальное
   золото, стеклянные шары, бонбоньерки, диамант-пудру, бенгальские огни,
   зажигательные нитки, комнатные фейерверки». Кондитерская Абрамова готовила
   к Рождеству «хлопушки, дожди золотые, пряничные, миндальные и мятные
   фигуры, восковые свечи, бусы из конфет, пастилу, драже и мармелад».
   Игрушки изготавливались рабочими артелями, делавшими их из проволоки и
   бумаги, из ваты и варёного крахмала, на них иногда клеили
   литографированные картинки. Продавались «дрезденские», клееные из картона
   фигурки. На ёлках раскладывали имитирующие снег кусочки ваты, усеянной
   блёстками, растягивали нити серебряного и золотого дождя, были очень
   популярны хлопушки и бенгальские огни. В комнате, где ставили ёлку, было
   принято ставить много цветов в вазах, украшали цветами и саму ёлку.

   В канун Рождества 1892 года в Мариинском театре в Санкт-Петербурге был
   впервые поставлен балет «Щелкунчик», на музыку П. И. Чайковского. С тех
   пор петербургская традиция постановки «Щелкунчика» на Рождество стала
   широко известной в европейских странах, а музыка к балету сопровождает
   праздничные ёлки во многих странах.

  В крестьянском быту[править | править код]

   В крестьянской культуре рождественская ёлка бытовала лишь с конца 19 века
   у западных границ Российской империи, отчасти будучи заимствованной
   славянами-католиками и униатами из городской традиции соседней Германии:

     Ель в виде срубленного деревца, его верхушки, веток, венка или гирлянды
     из еловых веток устанавливали (вешали) в церкви на весь период от
     Рождества до Крещения, втыкали за образа в доме, подвешивали к потолку,
     ставили в красном углу на лавке или даже на столе; его носили с собой
     колядники и пастухи, обходящие дома на Святки, а также украшали ими
     церковь, а по окончании святочного цикла эти ветки сохраняли в доме от
     грозы или втыкали их в поля, пеплом от сожженных веток обсыпали сады,
     огороды и т. п.

  Рождественская ёлка в годы советской власти[править | править код]

   Сразу же после октябрьских событий никаких официальных запретов ёлки и
   Рождества не вводилось. Если ёлка и стала большой редкостью в домах, то не
   в результате специальных запретов, а из-за всё растущих экономических
   проблем. Наоборот, в канун Нового 1918 года Горький и Бенуа подготовили и
   выпустили в петроградском издательстве «Парус» подарочную книгу для детей
   «Ёлка», оформленную самыми известными российскими художниками. В книгу
   были включены произведения Горького, Чуковского, Ходасевича,
   А. Н. Толстого, Брюсова, Саши Чёрного и многих других. На обложке был
   помещён рисунок наряженной ёлки, вокруг которой в весёлом хороводе
   кружатся Дед Мороз и лесные звери. На верхушке дерева сияет восьмиконечная
   Вифлеемская звезда^[19].

   24 января 1918 года декретом Совета народных комиссаров на территории
   страны был введён Григорианский календарь и было указано, что в текущем
   году после 31 января следует сразу 14 февраля. Так как православная
   Церковь продолжила использовать прежний календарь, это переставило
   Рождество и Новый год местами.

   В 1922 году в РСФСР стартовала кампания за преобразование праздника
   Рождества Христова в «комсомольское рождество», или, иначе, в «комсвятки».
   Комсомольские ячейки должны были организовывать празднование «комсвяток» в
   первый день Рождества, то есть 25 декабря, которое оставалось пока
   нерабочим днём. На мероприятиях читались доклады, разоблачающие
   «экономические корни рождественских праздников», делались политические
   сатиры и «живые картины». На второй день праздника организовывались
   уличные шествия, на третий — в клубах устраивались маскарады и ёлка,
   получившая название «комсомольская ёлка»^[19]. Однако через несколько лет
   эти меры были признаны неэффективными и «комсвятки» раскритиковали в
   центральной прессе.

   В апреле 1929 года XVI партийная конференция отменила праздник Рождества.
   Он стал рабочим днём и вместе с ним отменена была и рождественская ёлка,
   «поповский обычай». Газеты осуждали детские ёлки, потому что
   «религиозность ребят начинается именно с ёлки … Ребёнок отравляется
   религиозным ядом…». Вместе с ёлкой осуждался и Дед Мороз, вошедший в
   праздничный ритуал за пару лет до революции. Перед Новым 1929 г. любые
   празднования «поповских обычаев» запрещались. В декабре и январе
   специальные патрули из добровольцев ходили по улицам и заглядывали в окна,
   проверяя исполнение правительственного указа.

   Рождественская ёлка перешла на нелегальное положение. Те, кто не хотел
   лишать своих детей праздника, делали это теперь тайно. Писательница и
   переводчица Ирина Токмакова рассказывает, как в её детстве дворник за
   взятку ездил в лес, срубал ёлку и пилил её на две части, чтобы влезла в не
   слишком большой мешок. Дома ёлку скрепляли лубками и та «делалась опять
   целенькой и стройной»^[19].

  1936—1991: детские «ёлки» в СССР[править | править код]

   Запрещённая большевиками рождественская ёлка была заменена атеистической
   новогодней ёлкой в 1935 году. Никита Хрущёв писал в своих воспоминаниях,
   как Павел Постышев, приехав из Киева в Москву, в один из своих визитов
   обратился к Сталину:

     Вышли мы, сели в машину Сталина. Поместились все в одной. Ехали и
     разговаривали. @lt;…@gt; Постышев поднял тогда вопрос: «Товарищ Сталин, вот
     была бы хорошая традиция и народу понравилась, а детям особенно принесла
     бы радость — рождественская ёлка. Мы это сейчас осуждаем. А не вернуть
     ли детям ёлку?». Сталин поддержал его: «Возьмите на себя инициативу,
     выступите в печати с предложением вернуть детям ёлку, а мы поддержим».
     Так это и произошло.^[20]

   28 декабря 1935 года в газете «Правда» появилась небольшая заметка,
   подписанная кандидатом в члены политбюро ЦК ВКП(б) П. П. Постышевым. Она
   начиналась так:

     В дореволюционное время буржуазия и чиновники буржуазии всегда
     устраивали на Новый год своим детям ёлку. Дети рабочих с завистью через
     окно посматривали на сверкающую разноцветными огнями ёлку и веселящихся
     вокруг неё детей богатеев.
     Почему у нас школы, детские дома, ясли, детские клубы, дворцы пионеров
     лишают этого прекрасного удовольствия ребятишек трудящихся Советской
     страны? Какие-то, не иначе как «левые» загибщики ославили это детское
     развлечение как буржуазную затею.

   Автор призывал комсомольских и пионерских лидеров в срочном порядке
   устроить под Новый год коллективные ёлки для детей. Это предложение было
   принято к действию молниеносно. По всей стране были организованы ёлочные
   празднества, в магазинах появились «расширенные ассортименты ёлочных
   украшений». Таким образом, предложение (даже не указ) партийного
   руководства было принято и полностью осуществлено в масштабах страны всего
   за четыре дня, включая дату самой публикации^[21]. Подобная оперативность
   так и осталась недостижимым рекордом в истории СССР.

   Ёлка рекомендовалась в новом качестве — как детская забава, пригодная для
   юных строителей коммунизма. К празднику Рождества она больше не имела
   отношения, в неё нужно было вдохнуть совершенно новый смысл. Ёлка стала
   зеркалом нового мира советского ребёнка, её украшение и новое
   предназначение отражали круг мировоззрения и воспитания маленьких
   строителей коммунизма.^[22] На новый 1937 год детская ёлка впервые
   проводилась в Аничковом дворце, ставшем к этому времени Дворцом пионеров.
   Советские ёлки отличались публичностью, массовостью, обязательностью
   проводимой на них воспитательной работы.

   Украшение новогодней ёлки потеряло отчасти свою рождественскую символику и
   обрело символику советскую.

   На первых детских ёлках предлагалось повесить продававшийся в магазинах
   набор шаров с портретами членов Политбюро. В 1937 году в СССР открылся
   первый специализированный завод ёлочных игрушек. С этого времени
   развернулось широкое производство ёлочных игрушек: из ваты, картона,
   металла, стекла. Ассортимент и смысловое содержание ёлочных украшений для
   праздника Нового года существенно отличался от рождественского убранства.
   В 1930-е гг. игрушек для всех ёлок ещё не хватало, и они были в основном
   самодельными, склеенными из цветной бумаги или других дешёвых материалов
   (например, стеклянные шары, сделанные из перегоревших электрических
   лампочек, снежинки, вырезанные из бумаги); на веточки ёлки раскладывали
   имитирующие снег кусочки ваты. Звезду Рождества, голубую,
   семиконечную^[23], на верхушке ёлки заменили на красную пятиконечную
   звезду, аналогичную кремлёвской.^[24] Ёлочные игрушки были миниатюрными
   копиями вещей, зверей, куклами из ваты и стекла. Довоенные игрушки были
   чаще всего пионерские и политические: горнисты, ракеты, стратостаты и
   дирижабли, серпы и молоты. В войну на ёлках появились игрушечные танки,
   солдаты, собаки-санитары, пистолеты, гранаты и винтовки. К 1950-м годам
   появляются сказочные персонажи: снеговики и снегурки, снежинки и клоуны,
   красные шапочки, звездочёты. На ёлке горели гирлянды электрических
   лампочек. Под ёлкой ставились гипсовые или ватные куклы, изображающие
   снегурку и Деда Мороза вместо снеговика.

   Дед Мороз был подчёркнуто отделён от Рождества, для доказательства тому в
   тридцатые годы он появлялся на ёлках, держа в руках «Курс истории ВКП(б)».

   В 1937 году на ёлке во Дворце союзов вместе с Дедом Морозом появилась
   напарница, Снегурочка. До этого она была известна только как персонаж
   пьесы А. Н. Островского и поставленной в 1882 году оперы
   Н. А. Римского-Корсакова. Ни в каком обряде, и во всемирной рождественской
   традиции подобного женского персонажа не существует, это уникальное
   явление, связанное только с советской и российской новогодней ёлкой.

  «Новогодняя ёлка» в советское время[править | править код]

   С 1936 года ёлка в СССР стала неотделимым атрибутом отделённого от
   Рождества праздника Нового года. Отличительным признаком именно новогодней
   ёлки является празднование первых мгновений наступающего года: под бой
   домашних часов или под бой кремлёвских курантов, передававшийся по радио,
   поднимался новогодний тост.

   Двумя новыми атрибутами этого праздника стали: бутылка советского
   шампанского, разливаемого по бокалам для полночного тоста, а также
   рисунки(также открытки) и ёлочные игрушки, изображающие настенные часы,
   стрелки которых показывают время без пяти двенадцать.

   В 1960-е годы сложился уклад новогоднего праздника, существующий в России
   по настоящее время. Очень важным было широкое распространение телевизора;
   его включали за несколько часов до нового года, когда стол был уже накрыт.
   Праздничная телевизионная программа являлась общим сценарием для
   проведения семейного торжества. Около полуночи генеральный секретарь КПСС
   поздравлял граждан с праздником, в полночь били куранты, затем играли
   государственный гимн. Гимн слушали стоя, с бокалом в руках. Затем следовал
   праздничный концерт, или фильм-комедия. В 1956 году вышла на экраны
   музыкальная комедия Э. А. Рязанова «Карнавальная ночь», и дома культуры
   устраивали встречи нового года, взяв за удачный образец именно тот
   бал-маскарад, что показан в этом фильме. Наиболее известным из фильмов
   последующего времени стал фильм Э. А. Рязанова «Ирония судьбы, или С
   лёгким паром!», включающий в себя типично святочный сюжет весёлой и
   счастливой подмены, обмана, розыгрыша. Также ночной новогодний праздник
   включает в себя уличное гулянье; по русскому святочному образцу проходят
   игры с огнём, люди зажигают фейерверки, бенгальские огни.^[25]

   В конце 20 века в России вновь стали открыто праздновать Рождество, и
   вернулась прекращённая на время традиция рождественской ёлки.

   С конца 1990-х годов в России рождественскими ёлками иногда, наравне с
   редко встречающими вертепами, украшают православные храмы, например ставят
   их при входе в храм и на солее.

В XXI веке[править | править код]

   В Великобритании с 1946 года 20-метровая ёлка устанавливается в Лондоне на
   Трафальгарской площади. Эту ёлку присылает королевская семья Норвегии в
   знак признательности за освобождение страны от немецкой оккупации
   английскими войсками во время Второй мировой войны. Под этой ёлкой в
   предрождественские дни собираются тысячи англичан и поют рождественские
   гимны. Традиционно, ёлку на Трафальгарской площади украшают только
   вертикальные гирлянды из лампочек^[26].

   [IMG]Вильнюс, 2017. Украшенная рождественская ёлка ночью.

   В Риме ёлку устанавливают на площади Святого Петра. Согласно сложившемуся
   обычаю, каждый год ёлку Ватикану приносит в дар одно из европейских
   государств. Эта традиция была введена Иоанном Павлом II в 1982 году. По
   окончании рождественского периода древесина «главной ёлки Католической
   Церкви» идёт на изготовление предметов, доходы от продажи которых
   направляются на оказание помощи бедным^[27].

   В Нью-Йорке с 1931 года ёлка традиционно устанавливается перед
   Рокфеллер-центром. В канун Нового 2011 года её гирлянды состояли из 30
   тысяч лампочек, а на вершине размещалась хрустальная звезда 2,7 метра в
   диаметре, сверкающая кристаллами Сваровски^[28].

   Одна из самых оригинальных — искусственная плавучая ёлка в Рио-де-Жанейро
   на озере Лагоа. Её высота — 85 метров, а вес металлических конструкций —
   530 тонн. Эта ёлка вошла в Книгу рекордов Гиннесса как самая большая в
   мире плавучая ёлка. В неё вмонтирован механический колокол, исполняющий
   рождественские мелодии. В гирлянде более 3 миллионов лампочек, которыми
   управляет компьютер, а по выходным из ёлки бьёт салют^[29].

   Вообще самая большая рождественская ёлка в мире была сооружена в 2009 году
   в Мехико. Её высота 110,35 метра (высота 40-этажного здания), диаметр — 35
   метров, общий вес её металлических конструкций и украшений — 330 тонн. Это
   сооружение было установлено на проспекте Пасео-де-ла-Реформа^[30].

   Самая дорогая ёлка была установлена в 2010 году в Абу-Даби. Она была
   украшена золотыми и серебряными шарами, а также ювелирными изделиями с
   драгоценными камнями на общую сумму 11,5 млн долларов^[31].

   В 2011 году продолжилась «ёлочная война»^[15] между Ригой и Таллином. На
   исторические аргументы латвийской стороны власти Таллина решили установить
   заведомо бо́льшую ёлку. В результате 24-метровая ель на Ратушной площади
   дважды (25 и 27 ноября) падала под порывами ветра. Во второй раз она упала
   во всём наряде из 80 гирлянд (9,6 тысячи лампочек) и 15 комплектов
   фонариков, нанеся значительный ущерб и себе, и украшениям. К счастью, в
   обоих случаях никто не пострадал, а дерево наконец удалось закрепить,
   правда, укоротив его на 4 метра^[32]. По требованию властей Таллина
   полиция произвела расследование на предмет возможной диверсии^[33].

   В конце декабря 2012 года рождественская ель была установлена на границе
   Южной и Северной Кореи. Средства массовой информации и пропаганды Севера
   восприняли этот факт как часть античучхейской пропаганды и элемент
   психологической войны^[34].

Украшение ёлки[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Ёлочные украшения

   История ёлочных украшений в России во многом отражает историю самой
   России: сладости и стеклянные шары с Вифлеемской звездой на верхушке;
   затем бумажные самолёты и красноармейцы и красная звезда наверху первых
   советских ёлок; далее — бумажные снежинки и шары из перегоревших лампочек
   у ёлок военных лет; космонавты и часы «без пяти двенадцать» в 1960-х
   годах; купленные в огромной очереди, на новогоднем базаре дефицитные
   коробки шаров из ГДР и стеклянные пики наверху 1980-х^[35]. Сейчас
   украшение ёлки ограничено только финансовыми соображениями, а ассортимент
   в целом соответствует предлагаемому на Западе.

Новогодняя ёлка и охрана окружающей среды[править | править код]

   [IMG]
   Ёлочный базар в Сиэтле, США

   Массовый спрос перед Новым годом на хвойные деревья порождает проблемы их
   незаконной вырубки и утилизации после праздников. Поэтому различные
   государства стараются жёстко регулировать вырубку деревьев к Новому году,
   а также принимают меры для защиты лесов^[36]^[37].

     * В новогодние праздники организуются специальные ёлочные патрули,
       проверяющие у ввозящих в город ёлки наличие лицензии на вырубку.
     * Организация ёлочных лесопитомников, в которых выращиваются деревья
       специально для новогодних (рождественских) праздников;
     * Стимулирование продаж живых елей и пихт (в специальных ёмкостях —
       горшках, кадках) с организацией последующей сдачи их в лесопитомники
       для высаживания;

   Иногда предлагается стимулировать производство и продажи искусственных
   деревьев — в настоящее время предлагаются разборные искусственные ёлки
   весьма реалистичного вида. Их более высокая цена по сравнению с
   натуральными компенсируется многократным использованием. Противники такого
   подхода указывают, что производство искусственных ёлок само наносит ущерб
   окружающей среде. Этого не происходит при заготовке натуральных ёлок в
   лесопитомниках и в зонах плановой вырубки^[38]. Углеродный след от живой
   ели меньше, чем от искусственной. Чтобы воздействие на климат стало ниже,
   потребуется использовать искусственную ёлку больше 10 лет.^[39] WWF среди
   прочих вариантов предлагает сделать ель из подручных материалов своими
   руками.^[40]

         The modern Christmas tree… originated in western Germany. The main
         prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree
         hung with apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden.
         The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24,
         the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it
         (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later
         tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes.
         Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same
         room, during the Christmas season, was the Christmas pyramid, a
         triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas
         figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the
         16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had merged,
         becoming the Christmas tree (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2003).

   История новогоднего дерева – от древних времен до наших дней

          История новогоднего дерева – от древних времен до наших дней

   Содержание:

     * Все начиналось с культа
     * Почему ель?
     * Мы наш, мы Новый Год построим!
     * Перипетии ХХ столетия

   История появления в наших домах такого привычного атрибута веселых зимних
   праздников, как нарядная елочка, напоминает захватывающий сериал, где
   драма перемежается с легендами и настоящими сказками.

Все начиналось с культа

   Познавая окружающий мир, люди с давних времен стремились найти
   подтверждение идее бессмертия. Поэтому обычай приветствовать возрождение
   жизни – такой же древний, как и само человечество. В сказаниях и легендах
   наших далеких предков символом наступления Нового года стало вечнозеленое
   дерево, как надежда на изменения к лучшему. Ствол рассматривался как
   человеческое общество, крона – пантеон богов, а корни – место, где
   собираются темные силы. Древу поклонялись как маленькой копии
   неисчерпаемого мироздания. Не зря римляне и греки тысячелетия назад
   наряжали туи, можжевельники, ели, приветствуя обновленный мир..

   Но не только хвойные красавицы были важными знаками Новолетия. С этой
   ролью прекрасно справлялись пальмы, березы и вишни! В Средние века во
   многих уголках Европы Новый год встречали в марте, когда зимняя стужа
   сменялась долгожданной весной. Именно березу, - олицетворение любви, жизни
   и благополучия, - обряжали как праздничное дерево. Позже, в XV-XVI вв.,
   смену лет стали отмечать 1 сентября, и почетное место досталось вишне,
   приносящей сладкие плоды.

Почему ель?

   Как видите, пушистая лесная гостья с мягкими ароматными лапами не так
   давно по историческим меркам вытеснила остальных конкуренток с новогоднего
   Олимпа. Хотя, справедливости ради, стоит упомянуть древних кельтов,
   которые поклонялись именно ей, как знаку вечной жизни. А вот дальнейший
   путь нашей героини к сердцам людей скрыт за тайной столетий. Она
   появляется в своей обновленной роли сакрального украшения лишь в конце
   первого тысячелетия. Красивая и почти сказочная легенда говорит о том, как
   в VII веке некий набожный монах Бонифаций, обращая германских язычников в
   христианство, на глазах изумленной публики взял и срубил дуб, дабы
   доказать, что это вовсе не священный атрибут. Могучий красавец рухнул,
   сломав по пути всю растительность, за исключением ели! И проповедник якобы
   воскликнул: «Вот настоящий символ Христа, древо самого Бога!» С тех пор
   именно эта зеленая скромница стала главным олицетворением возрождения.

   Революционные времена протестантской Реформации принесли средневековому
   европейскому жителю новшество в виде украшенной яблоками и восьмиконечной
   Вифлеемской звездой ели, которую устанавливали в храмах на Рождество.
   Простые граждане приносили домой ветви и целые деревца, чтобы подготовить
   жилье к главному христианскому торжеству.

   А вот в ритуалах наших славянских предков елочка играла довольно печальную
   роль – ее ветви традиционно использовалась в похоронных обрядах. А ельник
   и вовсе не привлекал своей постоянной затененностью и мрачностью.

Мы наш, мы Новый Год построим!

   Возможно, такое отношение к пушистому чуду сохранялось бы еще долго, если
   бы не Петр I с его неуемной энергией и желанием ломать устаревшие
   стереотипы. Знаменитый Указ от 16 декабря 1699 года повелевал отмечать
   Новый год 1 января, по примеру христианской Европы. Царь призвал украшать
   в этот день улицы и дома зеленой хвоей. Так что вместе с еловыми, на
   фасадах зданий красовались также сосновые и можжевеловые ветки. У входа в
   дом многие городские жители ставили живые елки.

   Рождественские гулянья проводились с истинно петровским размахом. Но после
   кончины правителя энтузиазм немного поутих, и почти на сто лет красивая
   традиция приносить в жилье душистые игольчатые лапы была забыта. Не так-то
   просто изменить сознание людей и навязать им непривычные новшества.

   Лишь к концу царствования Екатерины II елки постепенно стали возвращать
   доверие как признак Нового года и Рождества. Их приносили в дом уже не из
   страха перед гневом высоких покровителей, а для создания радостной

   Окончательно возродили традицию в XIX веке петербургские немцы, активно
   привлекаемые в Россию еще со времен царя-реформатора. Именно эти
   педантичные переселенцы наряжали колючих прелестниц в своих особняках,
   подавая пример всем остальным горожанам, которые тоже спешили купить елки.
   Правда, организация веселых торжеств была довольно дорогой, и позволить ее
   себе могли только весьма состоятельные люди. С подачи великой княгини
   Александры Федоровны, урождённой принцессы прусской Фридерики Луизы,
   начиная с 1818 года «Ёлки» (а именно так стали называть празднование
   Нового года), стали ежегодно устраивать для питерской знати.

   К середине столетия нарядная живая ель стала уже традиционной гостьей в
   домах не только богатых аристократов, но и обычных граждан. В этой истории
   наша елочка напоминает сказочную скромницу-падчерицу, которая, благодаря
   доброжелательной поддержке волшебной Феи, превратилась в прекрасную
   королевну.

   Жители Российской империи постепенно так свыклись с мыслью, что Рождество
   должно пахнуть хвоей, что уже не представляли себе главный зимний праздник
   без окутанного гирляндами и веселыми игрушками разлапистого деревца, за
   которым с удовольствием шли на елочные базары.

   во времена СССР

   Грозные потрясения беспокойного века не минули и чудесную лесную гостью.
   По России одна за другой прокатились революции, народы бросило в пучину
   Первой мировой, унесшей миллионы жизней. Кровавая гражданская война катком
   прошлась не только по судьбам людей и целых наций, но и смела с повестки
   дня такую радостную отдушину, как встреча Нового года. Рождественская елка
   в 1929 году была объявлена советскими властями вне закона, как символ
   планомерно уничтожаемой религиозности в сознании простых граждан.

   Так сказка стала драмой. Но, к счастью, в подполье пушистая чаровница
   пробыла недолго. В 1935 году, дабы подтвердить сомнительный для тех времен
   лозунг «Жить стало лучше, жить стало веселее!» было предписано повсеместно
   организовывать новогодние утренники для ребятни, с песнями, хороводами,
   забавами в окружении блестящих шаров и сверкающих огоньков. Елочка
   вернулась в дома людей, чтобы наполнять сердца предвкушением чуда и
   ожиданием счастья в наступающем году. Композиторы и поэты стали сочинять
   про нее песни (помните – «В лесу родилась …»), а на сцены театров вернулся
   «Щелкунчик».

   Даже в непростые времена СССР уже никто не отнимал у советского человека
   веселый новогодний праздник. Правда, для его организации использовались
   только обычные лесные елки, и очень редко – сосны. А когда рухнул
   «Железный занавес», в стране начались долгожданные социально-экономические
   преобразования, и открылись границы, в Россию потянулись удивительные
   европейские красавицы – пихты Нордмана, Фразера. На смену вырубке елочек в
   лесу пришла культура выращивания новогодних деревьев в специальных
   питомниках.

   Де́рево (лат. árbor) — жизненная форма деревянистых растений с
   единственной, отчётливо выраженной, многолетней, в разной степени
   одревесневшей, сохраняющейся в течение всей жизни, разветвлённой (кроме
   пальм) главной осью — стволом^[1]^[2]^[3].

   Общее число деревьев на планете Земля в 2015 году было оценено в 3
   триллиона. На территории России из них — 640 млрд деревьев (первое место в
   мире). На территориях Канады и Бразилии — по 300 млрд. Ежегодно число
   деревьев на планете уменьшается примерно на 15 млрд, это происходит как в
   результате вырубки лесов, так и изменения климата^[4].

Классификация[править | править код]

   Деревья по виду листьев делятся на хвойные и лиственные.

     * Хвойные отличаются обычно жёсткими вечнозелёными (редко летнезелёными)
       игловидными или чешуйчатыми листьями, называемыми хвоей, или иглами,
       образуют шишки или можжевеловые ягоды. К этой группе относятся,
       например, сосны, ели, пихты, лиственницы, кипарисы, секвойи.
     * Широколиственные деревья имеют широкие и плоские листья — у которых
       толщина значительно меньше длины и ширины, обычно опадающие раз в год.
       Широколиственные (или просто лиственные) деревья обычно цветут и
       плодоносят. К этой группе относятся клёны, буки, ясени, эвкалипты и
       другие.

   Кроме классификации по виду листьев, деревья делятся по сроку жизни
   листьев — на листопадные и вечнозелёные.

     * Листопадные деревья имеют чёткую смену лиственного покрова: все листья
       на дереве теряют зелёную окраску и опадают, некоторое время (зимой)
       дерево стоит без листьев, потом (весной) из почек вырастают новые
       листья.
     * Вечнозелёные деревья не имеют чёткой смены лиственного покрова: листва
       находится на дереве в любой момент года, и смена листьев происходит
       постепенно, в течение всей жизни дерева.

   Кроме биологической классификации деревья делятся и по другим признакам:
   например, плодовые деревья (плоды которых используются человеком в пищу),
   ценные (древесина которых используется для промышленных целей),
   корабельные (используемые в кораблестроении), тропические (ареал которых
   проходит недалеко от экватора), северные (ареал которых проходит далеко от
   экватора) и так далее.

  Хвойные деревья[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Хвойные

  Сосновые[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Сосновые
   Дополнительные сведения: сосна, ель, кедр, лиственница, пихта и тсуга

   Сосна́ (лат. Pínus) — типовой род хвойных деревьев семейства Сосновые
   (Pinaceae). По современным данным в мире насчитывается около 120 видов^[6]
   сосны, которые в естественном произрастании рассеяны по всему Северному
   полушарию от экватора до заполярья. В умеренном и субарктическом климате
   они образуют леса на равнинах, а в субтропиках, тропиках и вблизи экватора
   произрастают в горах. Используется не только как источник древесины, но и
   в химической и фармацевтической промышленности. Плодоносящие виды сосны,
   дающие съедобные орехи, условно объединяются под названием кедровые сосны.
   Однако надо помнить, что Кедр (Cedrus) — другой род деревьев того же
   семейства, а семена сосны не являются орехами в ботаническом смысле.

   Сосна относится к весьма светолюбивым древесным породам, однако зачастую
   образует чистые насаждения — сосновый бор. Причина этого явления
   заключается в том, что сосна являясь одной из наименее требовательных к
   почве древесных пород, может расти на таких малоплодородных почвах, на
   которых рост других деревьев оказывается почти невозможным. Такое
   преимущество соснам даёт поверхностный тип корневой системы, который может
   развиваться в тонком (1—2 см) слое плодородной почвы, лежащей на песках.
   Например, в Карелии сосны могут иметь обширную корневую систему (имея
   отдельные корневые побеги длиной до 20 метров у взрослых деревьев),
   расположенную в слое всего 1 см толщиной. Такими типичными для чистых
   сосновых насаждений почвами являются сухие песчаные, на которых и
   заселяются сосновые боры. Характерной особенностью таких боров является их
   одновозрастность, объясняемая тем, что даже в наименее населённых
   местностях они сильно страдают от лесных пожаров и, легко обсеменяясь
   после каждого из них, вырастают вновь в виде одновозрастных насаждений.

   Ель (лат. Pícea) — род деревьев семейства Сосновые (Pinaceae). Насчитывает
   около 35 видов вечнозелёных высоких деревьев (до 30 м высотой) с красивой
   кроной. Ель является одним из главных символов европейского Нового года и
   Рождества.

   Кедр (лат. Cedrus) — олиготипный род деревьев семейства Сосновые
   (Pinaceae). В природе ареал рода охватывает южные и восточные горные
   районы Средиземноморья и западные районы Гималаев. Представители рода
   однодомные, вечнозелёные деревья высотой до 40—50 метров, с раскидистой
   кроной. Кора тёмно-серая, на молодых стволах гладкая, на старых
   растрескивающаяся, чешуйчатая. Хвоя игловидная, трёх- или четырёхгранная,
   жёсткая, колючая, тёмно- или сине-зелёная до серебристо-серой, со всех
   сторон снабженная устьицами, сидит на листовых подушках, собрана в пучки
   по 30—40 шт. Побеги укороченные и удлинённые, последние несут спирально
   расположенную хвою. Семена, ввиду смолистости, не поедаются грызунами.
   Растения требуют не уплотнённой сверху и хорошо водопроницаемых почв;
   очень чувствительны к застаиванию воды в почве (особенно кедр гималайский
   (Cedrus deodara)). Благодаря своей декоративности и быстроте роста кедры
   ценны для парковых насаждений как в группах, так и одиночно. Особенно
   ценны голубые и серебристые формы.

   Ли́ственница (лат. Lárix) — род древесных растений семейства Сосновые,
   одна из наиболее распространённых пород хвойных деревьев. Хвоя однолетняя,
   мягкая. Сплюснутая, ярко-зелёная, расположена на удлинённых побегах
   спирально и поодиночке, а на укороченных — пучками, до 40 штук в каждом. В
   благоприятных условиях вырастает до 50 и более метров в высоту при
   диаметре ствола до 1 м и более. Доживает до 300—400 лет, зарегистрированы
   лиственницы возрастом до 800 лет.

   Пи́хта (лат. Ábies) — род голосеменных растений семейства Сосновые
   (Pinaceae). Пирамидальные деревья, несущие кольчато расположенные
   горизонтальные ветви. Листья игольчатые (хвоя), плоские, у основания
   суженные в короткий черешок. Распространены в умеренных областях Северного
   полушария. Наиболее богатые видами области: запад Северной Америки
   (побережье Тихого океана) и Восточная Азия (особенно Япония). Характерная
   особенность пихт — шишки у них, в отличие от других хвойных, растут вверх.

   Тсу́га (лат. Tsúga) — род хвойных вечнозелёных деревьев семейства Сосновые
   (Pinaceae). Вечнозелёные деревья средних либо крупных размеров, высотой
   20—65 метров. Крона коническая либо несимметрично яйцевидная (у некоторых
   азиатских видов), основные побеги обычно опадают, свисают. Кора серая или
   коричневая, чешуйчатая, часто с глубокими трещинами. Ветви горизонтальные,
   часто сплющены и изогнуты вниз. Укороченные побеги умеренно развитые;
   молодые веточки и периферийные части стебля извилистые и свисающие,
   грубеют от крючковатых выступов после того, как лист опадает.
   Распространена в умеренных широтах Азии (Гималаи, Китай, Япония) и
   Северной Америки. Родиной считается Япония. На территории России и
   сопредельных стран интродуцировано (ввезено) несколько видов, в том числе
   Тсуга канадская (Tsuga canadensis) и Тсуга разнолистная (Tsuga
   diversifolia).

  Кипарисовые[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Кипарисовые
   Дополнительные сведения: Кипарис, Туя, Можжевельник и Секвойя
     * Кипари́совые (лат. Cupressáceae) — пряморастущие или стелющиеся
       ветвистые кустарники или деревья, семейство деревянистых растений
       порядка Сосновые. Листья растений крестообразно противостоящие или
       мутовчатые (по три, реже четыре). Молодые листья игольчатые (опадают).
       Цветки одно-двудомные.

   Кипари́с (лат. Cupréssus) — род вечнозелёных деревьев и кустарников
   семейства Кипарисовые с пирамидальной или раскидистой кроной. Листья
   мелкие, у молодых растений игловидные, у взрослых — чешуевидные, прижатые
   к ветвям и расположенные черепитчато в четыре ряда. На спинной стороне
   листа обыкновенно развита масляная желёзка, иногда резко очерченная.
   Кипарисы растут в субтропическом и тропическом климате Северного
   полушария, распространены в Средиземноморье, на Черноморском побережье
   Кавказа, в Крыму, в Сахаре, Гималаях, на юге Китая и в Америке от
   Гватемалы до Орегона. Ныне живущие виды кипариса — очень давнего
   происхождения; ископаемые и их хорошо сохранившиеся остатки встречаются
   уже в третичной формации. Кипарисы выращивают в садах и парках в качестве
   декоративных растений или живых изгородей. Чаще всего для создания
   декоративных изгородей применяется кипарис вечнозелёный (Cupressus
   sempervirens L.). Небольшой размер кипариса крупноплодного (Cupressus
   macrocarpa) позволяет использовать его даже как комнатное растение.

   Ту́я (лат. Thúja), туйя — род голосемянных хвойных растений семейства
   Кипарисовые (Cupressaceae). Вечнозелёные деревья или кустарники, редко
   очень крупные деревья до 60 метров высотой при диаметре ствола 2,5 метра и
   более. У молодых растений листья мягкие игольчатые, у взрослых —
   чешуевидные, накрест супротивные. Туя нетребовательна к условиям
   произрастания, хорошо выносит задымлённость промышленных городов.
   Используется в озеленении. Как правило, культивируются в открытом грунте.
   Наиболее распространены Thuja occidentalis, Thuja plicata и их
   многочисленные садовые формы.

   Можжеве́льник (лат. Juníperus) — род вечнозелёных хвойных кустарников и
   деревьев семейства Кипарисовые (Cupressaceae). Можжевельник обыкновенный
   известен также под названием ве́рес^[7]. Тюркское название различных видов
   крупных древовидных можжевельников, перешедшее в научную литературу, —
   арча́.

   Секво́йя (лат. Sequoia) — монотипный род древесных растений семейства
   Кипарисовые (Cupressaceae). Естественный ареал рода — Тихоокеанское
   побережье Северной Америки. Отдельные экземпляры секвойи достигают высоты
   более 110 метров — это одни из самых высоких деревьев на Земле.
   Максимальный возраст — более трёх с половиной тысяч лет. Название роду
   было дано в честь Секвойи (Джорджа Гесса) (Sequoyah, ок. 1770 — ок.
   1843) — индейского вождя племени чероки, изобретателя слоговой азбуки
   чероки (1826), основателя газеты на языке чероки.

  Плодовые деревья[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Плодовые деревья

  Семейство Розовые[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Розовые
   Дополнительные сведения: Яблоня, Груша, Айва и Слива

   Я́блоня (лат. Málus) — род, насчитывающий 36 видов (1976) листопадных
   деревьев и кустарников семейства Розовые с шаровидными сладкими или
   кисло-сладкими плодами. Многие виды яблони выращивают в качестве
   декоративных растений в садах и парках, используют в полезащитном
   лесоразведении. Обычно представляет собой дерево с развесистой кроной
   высотой от 2,5 до 15 метров. Ветви укороченные (плодущие), на которых
   закладываются цветочные почки и удлинённые (ростовые). У дикорастущих
   видов на ветвях колючки. Листья черешковые, голые или опушённые, с
   опадающими или остающимися прилистниками. Цветки белые, розовые или
   красные, собраны в полузонтики или щитки. Наиболее распространены: яблоня
   домашняя, или культурная (Malus domestica), к которой относится
   большинство возделываемых в мире сортов, яблоня сливолистная, китайская
   (Malus prunifolia), и яблоня низкая (Malus pumila). Из дикорастущих видов
   в лесах Европейской части и на Кавказе произрастает яблоня лесная, дикая
   (malus sylvestris); в Малой Азии, Иране, Крыму и на Кавказе — яблоня
   восточная, кавказская (malus orientalis); в Китае, Монголии, Приморском
   крае, Восточной Сибири — яблоня сибирская, ягодная (malus baccata); в
   лесах Тянь-Шаня — яблоня Недзвецкого (malus niedzwetzryana); в Северной
   Америке (долина Миссисипи) — яблоня Сулярда (malus soulardi). Все виды —
   хорошие медоносы. Древесина у яблони плотная, крепкая, легко режется и
   хорошо полируется; пригодна для токарных и столярных изделий, мелких
   поделок.

   Гру́ша (лат. Pýrus) — род плодовых и декоративных деревьев и кустарников
   семейства Розовые (Rosaceae). Форма кроны свободно растущего дерева —
   пирамидальная или округлая, склонна к загущению. Годовой прирост
   составляет 30—40 см. При благоприятных условиях груша достигает крупных
   размеров — до 5—25 метров в высоту и 5 метров в диаметре кроны. Листья,
   как правило, опадающие. Листорасположение спиральное в 5 рядов. Лист
   широкояйцевидной формы, 2,5—10 см длиной, короткозаострённый; цвет —
   тёмно-зелёный, блестящий, нижняя сторона листа голубовато-зелёная, осенью
   золотисто-оранжевая. Плод, как правило, — вытянутой формы с расширением в
   нижней части, есть сорта с шаровидными плодами. В диком виде в Европе
   груша распространена примерно до 60° с. ш., на северной границе ареала —
   редка. Предполагают, что происхождение культурных сортов груш связано с
   гибридизацией ряда видов, в частности, Pyrus achras Gärtn., Pyrus persica
   Pers., Pyrus cordata Desv., Pyrus elaeagnifolia Pall.. Груши
   культивировались в древних Персии, Греции и Римской империи. К 2006 году,
   в результате успешной селекции морозоустойчивых сортов, груша эффективно
   выращивается на садовых участках, расположенных на Урале и в Западной
   Сибири до 55° с. ш. В настоящее время насчитываются тысячи сортов груш.
   Разные сорта груш используются как декоративные или собственно плодовые
   деревья.

   Айва́ (лат. Cydonia) — монотипный род древесных растений семейства Розовые
   (Rosaceae). В природе ареал охватывает Кавказ, Закавказье и Среднюю Азию.
   Произрастает по опушкам, в лесах и по склонам в нижнем поясе гор,
   поднимаясь до 1400 м над уровнем моря. Предпочитает глубокую рыхлую,
   плодородную и влажную почву. Встречается на песчаных, аллювиальных почвах,
   краснозёмах, чернозёмах, а также на затопляемых болотистых местах. Широко
   распространилось и натурализовалось по всему Средиземноморью, умеренным
   районам Азии, южным и центральным районам Европы. Культивируется во многих
   районах Европы (до Шотландии и Норвегии, 63°50’ с. ш.), Северной и Южной
   Африки, Северной и Южной Америке, Австралии и Океании. Представляет собой
   листопадное дерево или кустарник высотой от 1,5 до 4—5 метров, с косо
   вверх поднимающимися ветвями. Кора тонкая, чешуйчато-лупящаяся, на стволе
   и старых ветвях тёмно-серая, красновато-бурая или черновато-коричневая,
   гладкая; на молодых — буровато-серая, шерстисто-войлочная; побеги
   серо-зелёные, густо войлочноопушённые. Листья очерёдные, яйцевидные или
   овальные, с клиновидным, реже округлым или слегка сердцевидным основанием,
   сверху тёмно-зелёные, снизу сероватые, длиной 5—10, до 12 см, шириной до
   7,5 см, с черешком до 2 см. Цветки правильные, большей частью одиночные,
   на коротких цветоножках. Венчик бледно-розовый, белый или розовый,
   крупный, до 4,5—5 см в диаметре. Плод — ложное яблоко, волосистое, почти
   шарообразное или грушевидное, нередко тупоребристое, лимонного или
   тёмно-жёлтого цвета, вначале войлочноопушённое, при созревании гладкое.

  Род Слива[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Сливовые
   Дополнительные сведения: Алыча, Вишня, Черешня, Абрикос, Персик и Миндаль

   Сли́ва (лат. Prúnus) — род плодовых косточковых растений, включает такие
   виды, как Слива домашняя, Вишня, Персик, Абрикос, Миндаль, Черешня и
   другие. Обычно относят к подсемейству Сливовые (лат. Prunoideae) или
   Миндальные (лат. Amygdaloideae) семейства Розовые (лат. Rosaceae).
   Известно несколько сотен видов сливы, распространённых, главным образом, в
   северных умеренных областях земного шара.

   Алыча́, или Сли́ва растопы́ренная (лат. Prúnus cerasiféra) — плодовое
   деревянистое растение. Вид рода Слива подсемейства Сливовые семейства
   Розовые. Одна из исходных форм сливы домашней.

   Ви́шня (лат. Prúnus subgen. Cerásus) — растение подрода Cerasus рода Слива
   (Prunus) семейства Розовые. Подрод Cerasus отличается от других подродов
   рода Prunus (Armeniaca — абрикос, Prunus — слива, Padus — черёмуха)
   следующими признаками: плод (костянка) гладкий, без налёта; листья в
   почкосложении вдоль сложенные; цветки расположены зонтиками, заключающими
   иногда по два цветка; развиваются одновременно с листьями или ранее их.
   Плоды вишни имеют кисло-сладкий вкус.

   Чере́шня, или Ви́шня пти́чья (лат. Prunus avium) — древесное растение (до
   10 метров высотой, иногда значительно выше — встречаются деревья более 30
   метров в высоту^[8]) из семейства Розовые (Rosaceae), произрастает в диком
   виде в лесах Украины, южной России, в Крыму, на Кавказе, других регионах
   Европы, в Северной Африке и Западной Азии, также широко распространено в
   культуре. Вишня птичья — самая древняя из форм вишни. Плодоносить начинает
   к концу июня, ранее плодоносит похожее по плодам с виду дерево
   называющееся Вишня Южная. Как полагают, она была известна уже за 8 000 лет
   до н. э. в Анатолии и в Европе — на территории современных Дании и
   Швейцарии (жителям свайных построек)^[9].

   Абрико́с, или Абрикос обыкновенный (лат. Prúnus armeniáca) — листопадное
   дерево средней высоты и окружности кроны. Вид рода Слива семейства Розовые
   (Rosaceae), а также плод этого дерева. Абрикос называется также
   жёлтосливником, морелью, курагой, жерделью, урюком. Абрикосовое дерево
   издавна выращивается во многих странах тёплого умеренного климата. В
   России широко разводится на Кавказе и в южных районах европейской части.
   Абрикос сибирский (Prunus sibirica L.), растущий в диком состоянии в горах
   Даурии, — это другой вид рода Слива. Дерево абрикоса растёт долго, в
   тёплом климате до 100 лет. Цветочные почки подмерзают при температуре
   −16 — −21 °С. Большинство сортов абрикоса морозостойкие, выдерживают
   морозы до −25 °С, а более стойкие до −30 °С. Деревья устойчивы к засухе
   (за счёт глубокого проникновения корней), их можно выращивать в жарких
   регионах с минимальным количеством осадков. Листья округлые, яйцевидные,
   на верхушке оттянутые, мелкозубчатые или удвоенно-зубчатые. Белые или
   розовые цветки распускаются до появления листьев. Плоды — однокостянки
   желтовато-красного («абрикосового») цвета, в очертании округлые,
   эллиптические или обратнояйцевидные. Косточка толстостенная, гладкая.

   Пе́рсик, пе́рсиковое де́рево (лат. Prunus persica: «персидская (слива)») —
   растение из семейства Розовые, подрода Миндаль. Весьма близко к
   миндалевому дереву, от которого отличается только плодами. Представляет
   собой дерево с ланцетовидными листьями с зубчатой кромкой. Цветки почти
   сидячие, розовые, появляются до развития листьев. Плод шаровидный, с
   бороздкой на одной стороне, обычно бархатистый. Косточка
   морщинисто-бороздчатая с точечными ямочками.

   Минда́ль (лат. Prunus dulcis, в прошлом — лат. Prunus amygdalus или
   лат. Amygdalus communis) — кустарник или небольшое дерево (4—6 м высотой)
   из подрода Миндаль (Amygdalus) рода Слива семейства Розовые (Rosaceae).
   Миндаль часто причисляется к орехам, хотя на самом деле он является
   косточковым плодом. По величине и форме миндаль похож на абрикосовую
   косточку. Миндаль произрастает на каменистых и щебнистых склонах на высоте
   от 800 до 1 600 метров над уровнем моря (миндаль бухарский доходит до
   2 500 метров), предпочитает богатые кальцием почвы. Весьма ветвистый.
   Побеги двух типов: удлинённые вегетативные и укороченные генеративные.
   Листья ланцетные. Цветки одиночные, до 2,5 см в диаметре, с белыми или
   светло-розовыми лепестками. Плод — сухая бархатисто-опушённая овальная
   однокостянка, сухой околоплодник при созревании легко отделяется от
   косточки. Произрастает небольшими группами по 3—4 особи, на расстоянии 5—7
   метров одна от другой. Очень светолюбив, весьма засухоустойчив благодаря
   хорошо развитой корневой системе и экономной транспирации.

  Шелковица[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Шелковица
   Дополнительные сведения: Тутовые

   Шелкови́ца, или ту́товое де́рево (лат. Morus) — род растений семейства
   тутовых, состоящий из 10—16 видов листопадных деревьев, распространённых в
   тёплом умеренном и субтропических поясах Азии, Африки и Северной Америки.
   В молодости быстрорастущее дерево, но постепенно замедляет свой рост и
   редко вырастает выше 10—15 метров. Листья очерёдные, простые, часто
   лопастные, особенно на молодых побегах, на краях зубчатые. Плод — сложный,
   состоящий из костянок, мясистый от разросшегося околоцветника, 2—3 см
   длиной, от красного до тёмно-фиолетового или же белого цвета, съедобный —
   у некоторых видов сладкий и имеет приятный запах. Живёт шелковица до 200
   лет, реже до 300—500.

Строение[править | править код]

   В дереве выделяют три основные части: корень, ствол и крона.

   Корень дерева — это, как правило, подземная часть растения. Основные
   функции — удержание дерева в вертикальном положении, всасывание
   питательных веществ из почвы и передача их в ствол. Корни имеют большую
   протяжённость: они могут уходить на глубину до 30 метров и в стороны на
   расстояние до 100 метров. У некоторых деревьев есть воздушные корни,
   которые находятся над поверхностью земли, а их функция схожа с функцией
   листьев.

   baccata)

   Ствол дерева выполняет функцию опоры для кроны, а также осуществляет
   передачу веществ между корнями и кроной. В зимний период времени выступает
   в роли хранилища влаги и питательных веществ. Древесный ствол состоит из
   сердцевины, древесины, которая нарастает от камбия внутрь, образуя годовые
   кольца — тёмные и светлые участки, видимые на поперечном спиле дерева.
   Количество годовых колец в лесах умеренной зоны соответствует возрасту
   дерева, а их толщина — условиям жизни дерева в каждый конкретный год. В
   засушливых районах у деревьев могут появляться ложные кольца после
   выпадения осадков. Снаружи ствол покрыт корой. В течение своей жизни
   дерево имеет, как правило, единственный ствол. При повреждении
   (спиливании) главного ствола у некоторых деревьев из спящих почек могут
   развиваться сестринские стволы. Часть ствола от основания до первых сучьев
   называется штамбом^[3].

   Крона дерева — совокупность веток и листьев в верхней части растения,
   продолжающая ствол от первого разветвления до верхушки дерева или
   кустарника со всеми боковыми ответвлениями и листвой^[10]. Различают такие
   характеристики, как форма кроны — от колонновидной до раскидистой и
   плотность кроны — от плотной до редкой, ажурной. Под действием света в
   листьях в результате фотосинтеза образуются необходимые вещества.

Рекорды, связанные с деревьями[править | править код]

   См. также: Список знаменитых и легендарных деревьев
     * Наибольшей высоты достигают деревья вида секвойя, в национальном парке
       Редвуд их высота достигает 115,55 м.^[11]
     * Самое толстое дерево в мире — баобаб, 15,9 м в диаметре.
     * Старейшим деревом в мире считается ель, растущая в горах на западе
       Швеции, вероятно, с ледникового периода. Её возраст составляет около
       9550 лет^[12]^[13].
     * Известна тополиная роща площадью в несколько десятков гектаров, все
       стволы которой объединены общей корневой системой.^[14]

Дерево в быту и культуре[править | править код]

   См. также: Мировое Древо
   [IMG]Мёртвое дерево, разлагающееся естественным образом в Виварии Нойкома
   (Olympic Sculpture Park, Сиэтл)

   В связи с широтой распространения и простотой обработки, во многих
   культурах мира широко используется древесина в качестве материала для
   строительства, изготовления предметов быта (мебель, посуда и т. д.) и
   благоустройства жилья.
   Дерево, как и камень, является естественным материалом, сохранявшим
   нанесённые изображения, что способствовало развитию письменности во многих
   языках. Способность дерева гореть помогла освоению огня, что резко
   расширило ареал человека на север, и позволила освоить новые типы жилья:
   пещеры, дома, иглу и т. д. Остающийся после сгорания уголь использовался
   для первых наскальных рисунков. Малая плотность древесины по отношению к
   воде способствовала развитию судоходства: начиная от плотов и заканчивая
   каравеллами — много лет суда делались из дерева. Особенности цветения
   некоторых деревьев стали нарицательными в культуре многих народов мира,
   так, в Японии цветок сакуры воспет многими поэтами и часто использовался
   для медитации и отдыха. На Востоке распространён образ цветка персика, в
   России был воспет яблоневый цвет.

   Наряду с металлом является материалом для изготовления музыкальных
   инструментов. Считается, что самым первым деревянным музыкальным
   инструментом на Земле был австралийский диджериду, ввиду того, что для его
   изготовления практически не нужно прилагать никаких усилий — термиты,
   выедая изнутри влажную древесину эвкалипта, образовывали естественную
   духовую трубу, размер которой можно было подкорректировать.

Дерево в религии[править | править код]

   С древних времён дерево символизирует жизнь и во многих первобытных
   религиях являлось объектом поклонения. Например, древние греки считали,
   что с каждым деревом связана нимфа — дриада.

   Древние кельты и друиды взаимодействовали с деревьями, используя в своих
   магических обрядах «коелбрены» — деревянные палочки размером в палец, на
   каждой из которых выжжен или выгравирован один из 20 знаков огама,
   соответствующих породе дерева. Коелбрен огама является ключом к великой
   сокровищнице магических тайн и основным источником силы друидов.

   Упоминания о дереве встречается также во многих современных религиях, в
   христианстве упоминается Дерево познания Добра и Зла, Дерево Жизни.

   Пальмовое воскресенье, или праздник Входа Господня в Иерусалим отмечается
   праздничным богослужением, на которое верующие приходят с пальмовыми
   ветвями. В России первой распускается верба (ива), поэтому стали
   использовать ветви этого дерева и праздник получил название Вербное
   воскресенье.

   В фольклоре мёртвое дерево (коряга) обычно служит символом или пристанищем
   нечистой силы.

   Древесина широко применялась для изготовления религиозной символики (идолы
   и прочее).

   МОСКВА, 30 ноя — РИА Новости. Празднование Нового года трудно представить
   без ели. Сейчас на рынке богатый выбор живых и искусственных деревьев,
   зеленых и других цветов, с шишками или светодиодами на иголках, разной
   высоты высоты и ширины. Как выбрать елку для дома, чтобы новогодний символ
   гармонично вписался в интерьер квартиры и простоял долго, - в материале
   РИА Новости.Разновидности новогодних деревьевВ список важных
   предновогодних задач, помимо подготовки подарков, входит выбор елки.
   Трудно представить праздник без нарядного дерева, щедро увешанного
   шариками и гирляндами. Сегодня дома ставят не только елки и сосны. Кроме
   того, существенно расширился ассортимент декора.Какие деревья можно купить
   к Новому году:1. Ель. Дерево ценят за приятный хвойный аромат, стойкий,
   свежий и ненавязчивый. Для праздника подходят разные виды елок,
   отличающиеся цветом, длиной иголок и ценой. Разновидности:2. Сосна. Первое
   достоинство сосны — опрятный внешний вид: дерево всегда выглядит пушистым
   и нарядным. Второе — иголки: длинные, тонкие и потому, в отличие от
   хвоинок елки, не такие колючие. Еще один плюс — длительность
   использования, говорит эксперт Александр Кузнецов, руководитель
   онлайн-магазина живых елок:"Сосна в среднем стоит три недели и не
   осыпается. У обычной русской ели биологический срок жизни короче, из-за
   чего опадание хвои может начаться уже через 10 дней".Отличительная
   особенность сосны — сильный аромат и активное выделение смолы, что
   устраивает далеко не всех (можно испачкаться в процессе украшения).3.
   Пихта. В природе существует около полусотни разновидностей этого
   вечнозеленого хвойника, отличающегося пышной и мягкой хвоей, правильной
   формой и приятным запахом. Для Нового года принято использовать кавказскую
   пихту (она же — датская ель, пихта Нордмана). Ее родина - Кавказ, однако
   хвойник хорошо прижился в Западной Европе, в частности, в Дании. Дерево с
   голубоватым оттенком неприхотливо, хорошо чувствует себя в помещении,
   иголки долго не осыпаются. Аромат не такой сильный, как у обыкновенной или
   голубой ели. Также в качестве новогоднего атрибута используют пихту
   Фрайзера.4. Туя. Декоративное растение относится к хвойным, хотя вместо
   привычных хвоинок у него и налегающие друг на друга чешуйки. Оно может
   дополнить праздничное убранство. Насыщенный зеленый цвет, богатый выбор
   размеров (маленькие туи в горшках красиво встанут на подоконнике или
   письменном столе) и доступность являются отличительным чертами этих
   растений.Виды новогодних елокТуя, пихта или ветки можжевельника — свобода
   в выборе новогодних деревьев пока не приуменьшила популярности елок,
   которые по-прежнему входят в топ продаж:"По опыту могу сказать, что перед
   Новым годом чаще всего покупают русские ели и сосны – деревья, относящиеся
   к эконом-сегменту. Также пользуются спросом датские елки и пихты Фрайзера,
   это уже средний и премиум-сегмент", - отмечает Александр Кузнецов.Когда
   человек останавливает свой выбор на классической новогодней елке, встает
   вопрос: какую брать? Живую или искусственную? У каждого варианта есть свои
   особенности, которые важно учитывать при покупке:Живая ель1. Живая ель
   срезанная.Для многих живая елка — это семейная традиция. Срубленное дерево
   при должном уходе будет радовать внешним видом и запахом не один день. Но
   после праздников елку нужно утилизировать, отдав на переработку.Тем, кто
   любит настоящие елки, но против вырубки (даже легальной), может подойти
   вариант в горшке.2. Живая елка в горшке.В горшках продают, как правило,
   елки небольших размеров. Такие деревья хорошо чувствуют себя в помещении,
   из-за медленных темпов роста могут подойти для многолетнего использования.
   Когда надоест держать такое дерево дома, его можно высадить в
   грунт.Искусственная ельОсновное преимущество — возможность неоднократного
   использования. Отсутствие хвойного запаха могут компенсировать специальные
   ароматизаторы. Но для хранения такой елки потребуется дополнительное место
   на антресоли или в гардеробе.Где покупать живую ельПриятный аромат живой
   ели не сравнить ни с чем. Несколько дней, а то и несколько недель дерево
   будет радовать домочадцев, наполняя квартиру запахом леса. Где можно
   купить живую новогоднюю елку:Любой из указанных вариантов не вредит
   экосистеме в случае, если торговля легальна и деревья специально
   выращивались для продажи или были срублены в лесу при противопожарных или
   строительных работах, прореживании лесополосы и т.д.Законность сделки
   определяет наличие у продавца:Базары для продажи елей оформляют
   соответствующим образом: ограждают, красиво освещают, снабжают вывеской с
   названием, юридическим адресом, графиком работы.Если хочется самому
   срубить елку, необходимо обратиться в местное управление лесного
   хозяйства. Там расскажут, что нужно для оформления разрешения, какие
   делянки для этого предназначены.Самовольная вырубка незаконна и грозит
   штрафом (4000 рублей для простых граждан, до 40 000 рублей для должностных
   и до 300 000 рублей для юридических лиц), в некоторых случаях —
   исправительными работами и/или лишением свободы.Когда покупать елкуЕдиного
   мнения по вопросу, когда лучше покупать елку, нет. Тем, кто ценит большой
   выбор, не любит суету и спешку, можно озадачиться подбором как только
   начнется активная торговля. Происходит это, как правило, в начале декабря.
   Опасность такой заблаговременной покупки кроется в том, что к Новому году
   числу живое дерево осыплется, поэтому в этом случае лучше выбрать
   искусственную ель.Выбор дерева накануне Нового года имеет свои достоинства
   и недостатки. Елка не успеет надоесть, создаст приподнятое настроение как
   раз к торжеству. Однако ассортимент деревьев в конце месяца уже не такой
   богатый, как в начале сезона елочной торговли.Можно выбрать "золотую
   середину", отправившись за новогодней елкой во второй половине декабря
   или, если речь идет о приобретении онлайн, сделать предварительный
   заказ:"Я рекомендую делать предзаказ на понравившуюся ель, — говорит
   эксперт Александр Кузнецов. — И тогда дерево уже привезут в определенную
   дату. Откладывать покупку на 31 декабря не советую: не факт, что цена на
   елки будет ниже, да и выбор останется небогатым. В прошлом году деревья на
   складах стали заканчиваться уже 25 декабря. Да и в последний день года
   тяжело украсить елку, поскольку хватает других забот: приготовить
   праздничный ужин, нарядиться, упаковать подарки".Как выбрать живую
   елкуПеред покупкой важно выбрать место под елку и измерить его габариты.На
   что важно обратить внимание при покупке живой елки:Как выбрать
   искусственную елкуПодготовка к покупке искусственной ели, как и настоящей,
   начинается с выбора места, где она будет стоять. В маленькую комнату
   резонно взять небольшое дерево, в просторный зал можно поставить
   новогоднюю елку повыше. Важно помнить о том, что после каникул дерево со
   всеми украшениями придется где-то хранить.Отличительная черта
   искусственного дерева — материал, из которого оно изготовлено. Современные
   производители чаще всего используют поливинилхлорид, нарезая из него хвою,
   добавляя светодиодные нити, используя ПВХ-леску. Такие ели являются одними
   из самых доступных по цене. Литые деревья из резины (PE-резина) смотрятся
   как настоящие, отличаются красотой и долговечностью. К недостаткам можно
   отнести высокую по сравнению с моделями из ПВХ стоимость.Основная
   опасность искусственной елки — токсичность. Наличие стойкого запаха
   пластмассы негативно отражается не только на настроении, но и на здоровье.
   Потому покупать ели следует при наличии бумаг, подтверждающих безопасность
   материалов, — сертификатов соответствия и пожарной безопасности.На что еще
   важно обратить внимание:Уход за новогодней ельюПравильный уход дольше
   сохранит жизнь настоящей елки и продлит срок службы искусственной. При
   покупке живой нужно решить вопрос с транспортировкой. Если вы понесете
   дерево в руках, стоит выбрать ближайший к дому елочный базар. Перевозка на
   машине требует аккуратного размещения в салоне или на крыше багажника.
   Само дерево следует аккуратно упаковать и перевязать.О чем еще важно
   помнить:Основная причина, которая может ускорить осыпание хвои, —
   пересушивание ели, говорит эксперт:@amp;quot;Не стоит ставить елку рядом с
   батарей, камином или другим нагревательным прибором, — рассказывает
   Александр Кузнецов. — Это негативно скажется на состоянии дерева. А вот
   регулярное опрыскивание веток, напротив, пойдет елке на пользу@amp;quot;.Уход
   за искусственной елью требует, в первую очередь, бережного отношения к ее
   сборке и разборке. Ветки следует аккуратно распрямлять, давая хвоинкам
   самостоятельно принять правильное положение. Как правило, на то, чтобы
   полностью распушиться, дереву требуется два-три дня.Одни искусственные ели
   можно мыть, другие — протирать влажной тряпочкой. Особенности влажного
   ухода указаны в инструкции, потому не будет лишним ее прочитать.Правильное
   хранение напрямую влияет на внешний вид синтетического дерева. Такие ели
   рекомендуется убирать в коробку или контейнер и ставить в теплое
   помещение, в котором нет высокой влажности и скачков температуры. Уличный
   неотапливаемый гараж или сырой подвал для елки не подойдут.Утилизация
   живой елкиКогда новогодние праздники подходят к концу, обычно встает
   вопрос, куда деть елку? Не стоит спешить и выбрасывать ее на помойку —
   хвойник еще может пригодиться."Есть специальная программа "Подари елке
   вторую жизнь", в рамках которой деревья, оставшиеся после праздника,
   направляют на переработку, к примеру, их них делают мульчу (органическое
   покрытие для почвы, улучшающее ее свойства, — прим. ред.)", - поясняет
   Александр Кузнецов.Помимо этого, новогодние деревья можно использовать в
   декоративных целях (например, для обустройства клумбы на даче), для
   растопки печей, в зоопарках и центрах реабилитации животных (для вольеров,
   как кормовую базу). Как правило, уже в середине января в городах начинают
   работать специальные пункты приема.Если не получается самостоятельно сдать
   ель на переработку, можно воспользоваться услугой по вывозу и утилизации
   деревьев, которую предлагают некоторые фирмы.

   МОСКВА, 30 ноя — РИА Новости. Празднование Нового года трудно представить
   без ели. Сейчас на рынке богатый выбор живых и искусственных деревьев,
   зеленых и других цветов, с шишками или светодиодами на иголках, разной
   высоты высоты и ширины. Как выбрать елку для дома, чтобы новогодний символ
   гармонично вписался в интерьер квартиры и простоял долго, - в материале
   РИА Новости.

Разновидности новогодних деревьев

   В список важных предновогодних задач, помимо подготовки подарков, входит
   выбор елки. Трудно представить праздник без нарядного дерева, щедро
   увешанного шариками и гирляндами. Сегодня дома ставят не только елки и
   сосны. Кроме того, существенно расширился ассортимент декора.
   Какие деревья можно купить к Новому году:
   1. Ель. Дерево ценят за приятный хвойный аромат, стойкий, свежий и
   ненавязчивый. Для праздника подходят разные виды елок, отличающиеся
   цветом, длиной иголок и ценой. Разновидности:
     * обыкновенная. Неприхотливое вечнозеленое дерево в форме конуса с
       короткими заостренными иголками длиной от одного до трех сантиметров.
       В природе высота елей может достигать 40 метров и более, для
       новогодних нужд используют молодые деревья высотой, как правило, до
       трех метров;
     * голубая. Вечнозеленый хвойник приятного цвета с оттенками от
       серебристо-голубого до изумрудного. Эту ель ценят за красоту — дерево
       с пушистыми ветками гармонично впишется в любой интерьер;
     * канадская. Декоративное растение, которое также называют глаука коника
       или просто конинка. Отличается правильной формой, мягкими иголками и
       небольшими размерами;

   2. Сосна. Первое достоинство сосны — опрятный внешний вид: дерево всегда
   выглядит пушистым и нарядным. Второе — иголки: длинные, тонкие и потому, в
   отличие от хвоинок елки, не такие колючие. Еще один плюс — длительность
   использования, говорит эксперт Александр Кузнецов, руководитель
   онлайн-магазина живых елок:
   "Сосна в среднем стоит три недели и не осыпается. У обычной русской ели
   биологический срок жизни короче, из-за чего опадание хвои может начаться
   уже через 10 дней".
   Отличительная особенность сосны — сильный аромат и активное выделение
   смолы, что устраивает далеко не всех (можно испачкаться в процессе
   украшения).
   3. Пихта. В природе существует около полусотни разновидностей этого
   вечнозеленого хвойника, отличающегося пышной и мягкой хвоей, правильной
   формой и приятным запахом. Для Нового года принято использовать кавказскую
   пихту (она же — датская ель, пихта Нордмана). Ее родина - Кавказ, однако
   хвойник хорошо прижился в Западной Европе, в частности, в Дании. Дерево с
   голубоватым оттенком неприхотливо, хорошо чувствует себя в помещении,
   иголки долго не осыпаются. Аромат не такой сильный, как у обыкновенной или
   голубой ели. Также в качестве новогоднего атрибута используют пихту
   Фрайзера.
   4. Туя. Декоративное растение относится к хвойным, хотя вместо привычных
   хвоинок у него и налегающие друг на друга чешуйки. Оно может дополнить
   праздничное убранство. Насыщенный зеленый цвет, богатый выбор размеров
   (маленькие туи в горшках красиво встанут на подоконнике или письменном
   столе) и доступность являются отличительным чертами этих растений.

Виды новогодних елок

   Туя, пихта или ветки можжевельника — свобода в выборе новогодних деревьев
   пока не приуменьшила популярности елок, которые по-прежнему входят в топ
   продаж:
   «
   "По опыту могу сказать, что перед Новым годом чаще всего покупают русские
   ели и сосны – деревья, относящиеся к эконом-сегменту. Также пользуются
   спросом датские елки и пихты Фрайзера, это уже средний и премиум-сегмент",
   - отмечает Александр Кузнецов.
   Когда человек останавливает свой выбор на классической новогодней елке,
   встает вопрос: какую брать? Живую или искусственную? У каждого варианта
   есть свои особенности, которые важно учитывать при покупке:

  Живая ель

   1. Живая ель срезанная.
   Для многих живая елка — это семейная традиция. Срубленное дерево при
   должном уходе будет радовать внешним видом и запахом не один день. Но
   после праздников елку нужно утилизировать, отдав на переработку.
   Тем, кто любит настоящие елки, но против вырубки (даже легальной), может
   подойти вариант в горшке.
   2. Живая елка в горшке.
   В горшках продают, как правило, елки небольших размеров. Такие деревья
   хорошо чувствуют себя в помещении, из-за медленных темпов роста могут
   подойти для многолетнего использования. Когда надоест держать такое дерево
   дома, его можно высадить в грунт.

  Искусственная ель

   Основное преимущество — возможность неоднократного использования.
   Отсутствие хвойного запаха могут компенсировать специальные ароматизаторы.
   Но для хранения такой елки потребуется дополнительное место на антресоли
   или в гардеробе.

Где покупать живую ель

   Приятный аромат живой ели не сравнить ни с чем. Несколько дней, а то и
   несколько недель дерево будет радовать домочадцев, наполняя квартиру
   запахом леса. Где можно купить живую новогоднюю елку:
     * на елочном базаре;
     * в питомнике хвойных растений;
     * в лесничестве, получив разрешение на самостоятельную вырубку;
     * с доставкой на дом при заказе в интернет-магазине.
   Любой из указанных вариантов не вредит экосистеме в случае, если торговля
   легальна и деревья специально выращивались для продажи или были срублены в
   лесу при противопожарных или строительных работах, прореживании лесополосы
   и т.д.
   Законность сделки определяет наличие у продавца:
     * разрешения на торговлю,
     * документов (фитопаспорт, товарно-транспортная накладная и пр.),
     * кассового аппарата,
     * упаковочного материала,
     * измерительной линейки,
     * книги отзывов и предложений.

   Базары для продажи елей оформляют соответствующим образом: ограждают,
   красиво освещают, снабжают вывеской с названием, юридическим адресом,
   графиком работы.
   Если хочется самому срубить елку, необходимо обратиться в местное
   управление лесного хозяйства. Там расскажут, что нужно для оформления
   разрешения, какие делянки для этого предназначены.
   Самовольная вырубка незаконна и грозит штрафом (4000 рублей для простых
   граждан, до 40 000 рублей для должностных и до 300 000 рублей для
   юридических лиц), в некоторых случаях — исправительными работами и/или
   лишением свободы.

Когда покупать елку

   Единого мнения по вопросу, когда лучше покупать елку, нет. Тем, кто ценит
   большой выбор, не любит суету и спешку, можно озадачиться подбором как
   только начнется активная торговля. Происходит это, как правило, в начале
   декабря. Опасность такой заблаговременной покупки кроется в том, что к
   Новому году числу живое дерево осыплется, поэтому в этом случае лучше
   выбрать искусственную ель.
   Выбор дерева накануне Нового года имеет свои достоинства и недостатки.
   Елка не успеет надоесть, создаст приподнятое настроение как раз к
   торжеству. Однако ассортимент деревьев в конце месяца уже не такой
   богатый, как в начале сезона елочной торговли.
   Можно выбрать "золотую середину", отправившись за новогодней елкой во
   второй половине декабря или, если речь идет о приобретении онлайн, сделать
   предварительный заказ:

   Ученые предупредили об опасности новогодних елок
   29 ноября 2021, 15:33
   «
   "Я рекомендую делать предзаказ на понравившуюся ель, — говорит эксперт
   Александр Кузнецов. — И тогда дерево уже привезут в определенную дату.
   Откладывать покупку на 31 декабря не советую: не факт, что цена на елки
   будет ниже, да и выбор останется небогатым. В прошлом году деревья на
   складах стали заканчиваться уже 25 декабря. Да и в последний день года
   тяжело украсить елку, поскольку хватает других забот: приготовить
   праздничный ужин, нарядиться, упаковать подарки".

Как выбрать живую елку

   Перед покупкой важно выбрать место под елку и измерить его габариты.
   На что важно обратить внимание при покупке живой елки:
     * высота. Подбирают с учетом высоты потолка в квартире или в доме. Брать
       дерево, задевающее макушкой потолок, не стоит — придется обрезать ее,
       чтобы повесить звезду или другое украшение. Небольшие ели способны
       гармонично вписаться в большое помещение, если ставить их не в центр,
       а в угол. Оптимальным вариантом для типовой квартиры может считаться
       елка высотой от 1,5 до 2-2,3 м (при высоте потолков от 2,7 до 3 м).
     * толщина ствола. При выборе дерева важна толщина ствола. Для ели (а
       также сосны и пихты) высотой от полутора до двух метров минимальным
       считается диаметр в шесть-семь см. Дерево с тонким стволом будет
       гнуться под тяжестью собственных веток и украшений.
     * прочность веток. Как и ствол, ветки не должны быть слишком тонкими,
       иначе они могут сломаться под тяжестью украшений. Для проверки на
       прочность нужно аккуратно согнуть одну ветку. У здорового дерева хвоя
       мягкая, а ветки эластичные, легко гнутся и выпрямляются.
     * цвет. Насыщенный зеленый цвет с оттенками от серебристого до голубого
       говорит о том, что это хорошее, качественное дерево. Оттенки рыжего и
       желтого — признаки обезвоживания, значит, хвоя скоро осыплется.
     * здоровье. О здоровье выбранного дерева свидетельствуют наличие смолы и
       хвоинок на стволе, отсутствие на нем темных пятен, плесени. Место
       спила должно быть чистым, светлым. Когда речь идет о покупке ели в
       горшке, следует обратить внимание на грунт, он должен быть слегка
       влажным.
     * запах. Почувствовать аромат ели можно, разломив в пальцах одну-две
       хвоинки. Если дерево не источает запах, то оно, скорей всего, засохло
       или перемерзло.
     * пышность. Здоровое дерево отличают ровные прямые хвоинки, которые
       хорошо держатся на ветке. Проверить, сохранится ли пышность, можно
       слегка тряхнув веточки. Если иголки осыпаются, елка быстро "облысеет".

Как выбрать искусственную елку

   Подготовка к покупке искусственной ели, как и настоящей, начинается с
   выбора места, где она будет стоять. В маленькую комнату резонно взять
   небольшое дерево, в просторный зал можно поставить новогоднюю елку повыше.
   Важно помнить о том, что после каникул дерево со всеми украшениями
   придется где-то хранить.
   Отличительная черта искусственного дерева — материал, из которого оно
   изготовлено. Современные производители чаще всего используют
   поливинилхлорид, нарезая из него хвою, добавляя светодиодные нити,
   используя ПВХ-леску. Такие ели являются одними из самых доступных по цене.
   Литые деревья из резины (PE-резина) смотрятся как настоящие, отличаются
   красотой и долговечностью. К недостаткам можно отнести высокую по
   сравнению с моделями из ПВХ стоимость.
   Основная опасность искусственной елки — токсичность. Наличие стойкого
   запаха пластмассы негативно отражается не только на настроении, но и на
   здоровье. Потому покупать ели следует при наличии бумаг, подтверждающих
   безопасность материалов, — сертификатов соответствия и пожарной
   безопасности.
   На что еще важно обратить внимание:
     * качество хвоинок (не должны осыпаться);
     * надежная подставка;
     * гарантия (на товары из ПВХ достигает 10-12 лет, на литые конструкции
       до 30 и выше);
     * цвет. Зеленая, голубая, золотистая, белая — из многообразия цветовой
       гаммы нетрудно выбрать ту, что лучше всего подойдет под интерьер.

   21 апреля 2021, 10:00

Уход за новогодней елью

   Правильный уход дольше сохранит жизнь настоящей елки и продлит срок службы
   искусственной. При покупке живой нужно решить вопрос с транспортировкой.
   Если вы понесете дерево в руках, стоит выбрать ближайший к дому елочный
   базар. Перевозка на машине требует аккуратного размещения в салоне или на
   крыше багажника. Само дерево следует аккуратно упаковать и перевязать.
   О чем еще важно помнить:
     * не нужно сразу заносить ель в теплую квартиру. Перепад температур
       плохо скажется на ее состоянии. Лучше немного подержать дерево в
       подъезде или на балконе.
     * увлажнение необходимо. Чаще всего ели ставят в ведро с водой, но может
       подойти и горшок с землей (ее нужно будет периодически поливать).
     * на состоянии елки положительно сказывается подкормка питательными
       растворами.

   Почему не стоит долго держать новогоднюю елку в доме
   13 января 2021, 04:11
   Основная причина, которая может ускорить осыпание хвои, — пересушивание
   ели, говорит эксперт:
   «

   "Не стоит ставить елку рядом с батарей, камином или другим нагревательным
   прибором, — рассказывает Александр Кузнецов. — Это негативно скажется на
   состоянии дерева. А вот регулярное опрыскивание веток, напротив, пойдет
   елке на пользу".

   Уход за искусственной елью требует, в первую очередь, бережного отношения
   к ее сборке и разборке. Ветки следует аккуратно распрямлять, давая
   хвоинкам самостоятельно принять правильное положение. Как правило, на то,
   чтобы полностью распушиться, дереву требуется два-три дня.
   Одни искусственные ели можно мыть, другие — протирать влажной тряпочкой.
   Особенности влажного ухода указаны в инструкции, потому не будет лишним ее
   прочитать.
   Правильное хранение напрямую влияет на внешний вид синтетического дерева.
   Такие ели рекомендуется убирать в коробку или контейнер и ставить в теплое
   помещение, в котором нет высокой влажности и скачков температуры. Уличный
   неотапливаемый гараж или сырой подвал для елки не подойдут.

Утилизация живой елки

   Открытие елочных базаров в Москве - РИА Новости, 1920, 04.03.2021
   Более 44,5 тысяч новогодних деревьев сдали москвичи на переработку
   4 марта 2021, 10:04
   Когда новогодние праздники подходят к концу, обычно встает вопрос, куда
   деть елку? Не стоит спешить и выбрасывать ее на помойку — хвойник еще
   может пригодиться.
   "Есть специальная программа "Подари елке вторую жизнь", в рамках которой
   деревья, оставшиеся после праздника, направляют на переработку, к примеру,
   их них делают мульчу (органическое покрытие для почвы, улучшающее ее
   свойства, — прим. ред.)", - поясняет Александр Кузнецов.
   Помимо этого, новогодние деревья можно использовать в декоративных целях
   (например, для обустройства клумбы на даче), для растопки печей, в
   зоопарках и центрах реабилитации животных (для вольеров, как кормовую
   базу). Как правило, уже в середине января в городах начинают работать
   специальные пункты приема.
   Если не получается самостоятельно сдать ель на переработку, можно
   воспользоваться услугой по вывозу и утилизации деревьев, которую
   предлагают некоторые фирмы.

ель, или другое дерево, украшенное к Новому году / Материал из Википедии —
свободной энциклопедии

    Уважаемый Wikiwand AI, давайте упростим задачу, просто ответив на эти
    ключевые вопросы:

   Перечислите основные факты и статистические данные о Новогодняя ёлка?

   Кратко изложите эту статью для 10-летнего ребёнка

   ПОКАЗАТЬ ВСЕ ВОПРОСЫ

   Новогоднее дерево — настоящее или символическое дерево, наряжаемое
   специально к Новому году. Традиции новогоднего дерева существуют на
   территории бывшего СССР, как советской альтернативы Рождеству, а также в
   Азии.

   В России и других странах бывшего социалистического лагеря изначально
   возникла как Ёлка к Рождеству и переняла большую часть традиций от неё.
   Существует не только в России, но и в других государствах и странах, где
   Рождество традиционно не празднуется, например в Турции, Вьетнаме, Японии.
   Считается главным символом Нового года.

Распространение и экология[править | править код]

   Род насчитывает около десяти листопадных и вечнозелёных видов,
   распространённых в Северном полушарии — в Средиземноморье, Северной
   Америке, Средней и Малой Азии, а также в Юго-Западной и Центральной
   Европе.

   Wissens, 1900

  Природный ареал рода[править | править код]

   В Старом Свете в естественных условиях сейчас растут лишь два вида
   платана — Platanus orientalis (Платан восточный) и Platanus kerrii.
   Естественный ареал платана восточного сосредоточен на черноморском
   побережье Кавказа в России, Абхазии, Грузии, в Армении и Азербайджане, на
   Балканском полуострове (Албания, Греция), островах Кипре и Крите, на
   островах Эгейского моря, в Малой и Средней Азии, на восточном берегу
   Средиземного моря (Сирия, Ливан, Израиль) и в отдельных местах
   произрастания на территории Ирана, Афганистана. Естественный ареал
   Platanus kerrii — Индокитай (Вьетнам, Лаос). В Новом Свете в естественных
   условиях растут североамериканские Platanus racemosa (Калифорния),
   Platanus wrightii, Platanus mexicana, Platanus lindeniana (Мексика),
   Platanus occidentalis (США). Согласно флористическому разделению суши по
   А. Л. Тахтаджяну (1974), природные ареалы видов рода Platanus L. находятся
   в пределах Голарктичного флористического царства и только один вид
   Platanus kerrii в Индокитайской области Палеотропического царства. Ареалы
   видов рода Platanus L. территориально разделены сушей и океаном.

  Географическое распространение видов[править | править код]

   По данным ряда исследователей, виды рода Platanus широко используются в
   культуре в США, странах Европы и Азии. Северная граница ареала проходит
   около 46° с. ш. по континенту Северной Америки, в Великобритании она
   переходит за 65° с. ш., в Европе проходит около 55° с. ш., в Азии держится
   около 40° с. ш. Южная граница ареала проходит около 20° с. ш. в Северной
   Америке, до 30° с. ш. в Азии и Африке, до 15° с. ш. в Индокитае, в
   Австралии 10-15 ю. ш. Анализируя современное географическое
   распространение рода Platanus L., следует заметить, что не все виды этого
   рода в равной степени используются в культуре. Так, например: Platanus
   kerrii практически неизвестен в культуре за пределами Вьетнама и Лаоса, P.
   mexicana, P. lindeniana — за пределами Мексики, Platanus wrightii, P.
   racemosa известны в культуре только в США и Мексике. Среди всех ныне
   существующих видов платана широкое географическое распространение имеет
   платан клёнолистный (Platanus acerifolia). По мнению многих учёных мира,
   первый экземпляр платана клёнолистного возник от случайного или
   преднамеренного скрещивания платана западного и платана восточного в
   Англии. Благодаря своей выносливости и высокой экологической пластичности
   в течение XVIII века этот вид широко распространился на территории Европы.
   Сейчас платан клёнолистный широко культивируется от Средиземноморья до
   побережья Северного моря в Евразии, а также на Североамериканском материке
   в США и Мексике и на Австралийском материке.

  Палеоботанические исследования[править | править код]

   [IMG]Отпечаток листа Platanus aceroides

   На основе изучения ископаемых платанов в результате палеоботанических
   исследований установлено, что первые представители рода Платан возникли в
   меловую эпоху в позднем альбе — в начале сеномана. Сейчас следы рода
   Платан широко представлены в отложениях мелового периода на Дальнем
   Востоке, в Сибири, Казахстане, странах Европы, в Северной и Южной Америке.
   Наибольший видовой состав и распространение род Платан имел в неогене.
   Среди платанов неогенового периода существовали виды, которые имели много
   общих морфологических признаков с современными видами. Так, Platanus
   academia Gaud, Platanus schimperi (Herr) Sap. et Mar. и Platanus
   lineariloba Kol. имеют общие морфологические черты с платаном восточным
   (Platanus orientalis L.), Platanus aceroides Geopp. с современным платаном
   западным (Platanus occidentalis L.), Platanus wyomingensis Will. — с
   платаном Райта (Platanus wrightii Wats.) Общие морфологические признаки в
   строении листьев и соцветий имеют также олигоценовый Platanus neptuni
   Ettinghausen (Buzek) Holy @amp; Kvacek, палеогеновый Platanus bella (Herr)
   Kvacek @amp; Manchester и современный вечнозелёный вид — платан Керра
   (Platanus kerrii Gagnep.) Не имеют аналогов среди современных видов такие
   вымершие платаны, как Platanus mabutii Oishi et Huzioka, Platanus dissecta
   Lesq., Platanus asymmetrica N.Maslova, Platanus integrifolia N.Maslova,
   Platanus stenocarpa N.Maslova, Platanus newberryana Herr.

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   Платаны — высокие листопадные деревья с густой широкой кроной.

   Ствол мощный (высота до 50 м, окружность до 18 м), цилиндрический, с
   зеленовато-серой отслаивающейся корой.

   Листья очерёдные, пальчато-лопастные, на длинных черешках, похожи на
   листья клёна остролистного.

   Плод — многоорешек, остающийся на дереве всю зиму и распадающийся весной
   на отдельные орешки, разносимые ветром.

  Известные деревья[править | править код]

   [IMG]Платан Гиппократа на острове Кос [IMG]Платан Пушкина в Гурзуфе

   Живут платаны очень долго. Самый крупный и самый древний из них растёт в
   долине Буюкдере в Турции, у Босфора. Высота его 50 метров, окружность
   ствола 42 м, диаметр ствола — 13,4 метра, а возраст — более 2300 лет.

   На острове Кос в Эгейском море произрастает уникальный платан с
   окружностью ствола 18 м и высотой 36 м. Его ориентировочный возраст
   составляет 2 тысячи лет.

   [IMG]Двухтысячелетний cхторашенский платан

   В Туркменистане известен тысячелетний платан «семь братьев» (назван так
   потому, что основной его ствол на высоте 3 м от земли образует ещё семь
   крупных стволов). Высота дерева 45 м, окружность основного ствола — 26 м.

   Гигантский платан возрастом более двух тысяч лет произрастает возле
   селения Схторашен (Шых Дурсун) в Нагорном Карабахе среди старого тутового
   сада. Его высота 54 м, охват ствола у основания 31,5 м^[4]

Номенклатура и систематика[править | править код]

   Род Платан (Platanus L.) — единственный представитель семейства Платановые
   (Platanaceae Lindl.). В филогенетической системе цветковых растений
   А. Л. Тахтаджяна (1987) род Platanus принадлежит к семейству Platanaceae
   Lindl. порядка Hamamelidales Takht. надпорядка Hamamelidanae Takht.
   подкласса Hamamelidae Takht. класса Magnoliopsida (Dicotyledones) отдела
   Magnoliophyta (Angiospermae).

  Виды[править | править код]

   По информации базы данных The Plant List (2013), род включает 9 видов^[5]:

     * Platanus × acerifolia (Aiton) Willd. — Платан клёнолистный, или Платан
       гибридный [= Platanus occidentalis × Platanus orientalis]
     * Platanus gentryi Nixon @amp; J.M.Poole
     * Platanus kerrii Gagnep. — Платан Керра^[6]
     * Platanus mexicana Moric. — Платан мексиканский
     * Platanus occidentalis L. — Платан западный
     * Platanus orientalis L. typus^[1] — Платан восточный, чинар, чинара
     * Platanus racemosa Nutt. — Платан кистистый
     * Platanus rzedowskii Nixon @amp; J.M.Poole
     * Platanus wrightii S.Watson — Платан Райта

Хозяйственное значение[править | править код]

   Платаны являются одними из немногих представителей орнаментальных
   лиственных деревьев, которые благодаря прекрасной, густой кроне, красивой
   и своеобразной светло-пятнистой окраске ствола и ветвей и оригинальным
   шаровидным соплодиям считаются декоративно ценными.

   Благодаря ценности платанов в декоративном отношении и высокой стойкости
   против атмосферных загрязнений сейчас происходит процесс замены ими в
   городах Европы менее устойчивых пород, таких как каштаны, клёны, липы,
   тополя и др.

   В США, Великобритании, странах Юго-Западной Европы и Средней Азии платаны
   широко используют в лесном хозяйстве.

  Применение древесины[править | править код]

   Древесина платана всегда ценилась благодаря своим физико-механическим
   свойствам. Она используется для изготовления ценной мебели,
   высококачественного декоративного шпона, напольных покрытий, столярных
   изделий, оформления интерьеров и для выполнения различных отделочных
   работ.

   Платан легко обрабатывается вручную и на станках, даёт доброкачественную
   гладкую поверхность, но при строгании и профилировании требует острой
   заточки режущих кромок во избежание отщепления и задира волокон вблизи
   сердцевинных лучей на радиальных разрезах. Древесина неплохо
   протравливается красителями, полируется и склеивается^[7].

Платан в культуре[править | править код]

   С глубокой древности платан почитается разными народами. Самым старым и
   могучим чинарам на Востоке давали личные имена. С прекрасными стройными
   молодыми чинарами восточные поэты сравнивали своих возлюбленных.

   В Древнем Египте его считали воплощением богини неба Нут.

   В мифологии классической Греции, унаследованной от Минойского Крита,
   платан — священное дерево Елены Прекрасной, супруги царя Спарты Менелая.
   Посвящённый ей платан рос в Спарте. Платаны также связывали с культом
   Аполлона, Диониса, Геракла.

   Под платаном разворачивается действие одного из диалогов Платона.

   В Армении платан считался священным деревом, по шелесту листвы которого
   армянские жрецы определяли волю Бога-Творца и предсказывали будущее.
   Существовали священные платановые рощи (например, «Роща Творения» близ
   столицы Великой Армении города Армавира, ныне сохранилась платановая роща
   в долине реки Цав в регионе Сюник). Вырубка платана считалась
   святотатством и была строго запрещена ^[источник не указан 1075 дней].

   Платан стал символом Кашмира^[источник не указан 1734 дня].

   В Испании влюблённые, разлучаясь, разрывают лист платана на две части и
   хранят их как залог встречи^[источник не указан 1734 дня].

  В христианстве[править | править код]

   В Библии величественные, высокие платаны — деревья Бога^[источник не
   указан 1734 дня].

   В истории христианства платаны также оставили свой след. С ними связаны
   церковные предания о святых подвижниках. Два святых платана растут в
   Греции на острове Кефалония, в монастыре, основанном святым преподобным
   Герасимом Новым Ватопедским (1508—1579).

  В музыке[править | править код]

   Платану посвящена одноимённая песня из второго концертного альбома^[8]
   «Аквариум. 10 лет» группы «Аквариум», студийная версия которой вошла в
   качестве бонус-трека в альбом «Радио Африка».

   В опере Г. Ф. Генделя «Ксеркс», в первой арии "Ombra mai fu"^[en]
   воспевается Платан.

   Платан

   В южных городах улицы и скверы нередко украшают платаном, который
   представляет собой высокорослое дерево, имеющее крепкий ствол и
   раскидистую эффектную крону. Такое дерево относится к числу наиболее
   древних, так как самый старый платан является истинным долгожителем, его
   возраст составляет больше 2300 лет.

   В Древней Персии и Греции считали, что платан является наиболее красивым
   деревом Востока. Так как ареал распространения довольно широк, то это
   поспособствовало формированию разнообразных экологических типов такого
   растения. На сегодняшний день его разновидности можно увидеть в регионах,
   где климатические условия довольно суровы.

Особенности платана

   [IMG][IMG]

   При благоприятных условиях платан может прожить очень много лет. Средняя
   продолжительность его жизни от 800 до 1000 лет. При этом некоторые
   экземпляры доживают до 2 тысяч лет и даже больше. Помимо этого дерево
   является довольно крупным, именно поэтому греческое название «платан» в
   переводе означает «широкий». Рост чинара не прекращается в течении всей
   его жизни. Это связано с тем, что он активно вырабатывает камбий —
   образовательная ткань в корнях и побегах, благодаря которой утолщается
   древесный слой. В самой древесине образуется лигнин (органический
   полимер), благодаря которому она становится более качественной и очень
   прочной.

   Ствол в высоту может доходить до 50 метров, при этом в поперечнике
   достигать 8 метров. Его поверхность покрыта плотным слоем коры бурого либо
   светло-зеленого окраса. По мере созревания коры происходит ее сброс
   тоненькими пластинками, в результате чего происходит обнажение молодой
   поверхности зеленовато-желтого окраса. В результате этого платан не
   скапливает в себе токсичные вещества, благодаря чему он прекрасно себя
   чувствует в черте города, где в воздухе нередко скапливается большое
   количество выхлопных газов.

   Большие длинночерешковые плотные листовые пластины могут иметь длину около
   30 сантиметров. Формой они сильно схожи с листвой клена —
   пальчато-лопастные. В весеннее время дерево выглядит наиболее декоративно.
   Ветки в это время украшает множество гроздьев, состоящих из небольших
   мужских и женских цветков, которые располагаются на удлиненных цветоносах.
   Чинара отцветает довольно быстро, и на месте соцветий формируются плоды.

   На ветвях появляется множество соплодий типа многоорешка. Внешне они
   выглядят как маленькие шарообразные шишки, которые сверху покрывает щетина
   высокой жесткости. В их состав входит большое количество очень маленьких
   плодовых головок, внутри которых находятся семена. Плодовые головки
   объединяет жесткий околоплодник. Соплодия остаются на растении и тогда,
   когда опадет листва. С наступлением следующего весеннего периода
   происходит их распадение на отдельные семена, которые подхватывает порыв
   ветра и уносит подальше от материнского растения.

Виды платана с фото и названиями

   По разным источникам род платан (Platanus) объединяет 10 либо 11 видов.
   Они отличаются между собой внешним видом и предпочтениями к климатическим
   условиям. Чаще всего встречаются такие виды, как:

  Платан западный или Сикомор (Platanus occidentalis)

   Платан западныйПлатан западный

   Его родиной является Северная Америка. Этот вид наиболее устойчив к
   морозам. Он выдерживает даже самые морозные зимы (до минус 35 градусов).
   Высота ствола может доходить до 40 м. Крона раскидистая и очень пышная.
   Размах веток нередко доходит до 25 м. Древесина окрашена в бело-кремовый
   оттенок. Это дерево может пострадать от продолжительной засухи.

  Платан восточный или чинар (Platanus orientalis)

   Платан восточныйПлатан восточный

   Вид распространен в городах Кавказа, Крыма и Средней Азии. Он отличается
   очень высокой декоративностью, при этом его ствол имеет высоту около 30 м.
   Ствол цилиндрический, а крупная крона имеет форму купола. Пятилопастные
   листовые пластины в длину достигают примерно 30 сантиметров. Ежегодно в
   летнее время растение формирует большое количество гроздьев, в состав
   которых входит от 5 до 7 бледно-красных «чинариков», сверху покрытых
   колючками. Растение с легкостью переносит снижение температуры до минус 15
   градусов. Листья не облетают с ветвей на протяжении длительного времени.
   Происходит это только тогда, когда начнется следующий период вегетации.

  Платан Керра (Platanus kerrii)

   Платан КерраПлатан Керра

   Его родиной является Индокитай. В отличии от иных видов его листва
   цельная, кожистая на ощупь, продолговатой формы. Вегетативные органы имеют
   анатомическое строение, которое схоже с древними видами, растущими в
   третичном периоде. Именно их потомком данный вид и считается.

  Платан кленолистный или обыкновенный (Platanus × acerifolia)

   Платан кленолистныйПлатан кленолистный

   Для получения данного гибрида селекционеры скрестили западный и восточный
   экотипы. Такое высокорослое растение (высота более 40 м) обладает широкой
   густой кроной, тень от которой настолько огромна, что в ней могут
   уместиться около 300 человек. Гибрид устойчив к морозам и с легкостью
   приспосабливается к суровому климату средних широт. Листва по форме
   напоминает кленовую — трех-лопастная, в верхних частях имеется заострение.

  Платан мексиканский (Platanus mexicana)

   Платан мексиканскийПлатан мексиканский

   Встречается на территории Мексики. В данной стране он широко распространен
   в культуре, им украшают дворы и улицы. В природных условиях его можно
   повстречать в речных долинах. Его высота около 45 м. Щетинистые плоды в
   поперечнике достигают около 20 мм, в их состав входит 3 или 4 плодовые
   головки.

  Платан Райта (Platanus wrightii)

   Платан РайтаПлатан Райта

   Встречается в городской черте на территории США и Мексики. Высота растения
   около 25 метров. Ствол прямой и разделяющийся. Его украшает густая крона,
   имеющая куполообразную форму. В ее состав входят сильнорассеченные
   тоненькие листовые пластины. Плод размещается на длинной плодоножке, при
   этом в его состав входит несколько плодовых головок.

  Платан кистистый (Platanus racemosa)

   Платан кистистыйПлатан кистистый

   Он встречается в Северной Америке. Его широко применяют для украшения
   улиц. Высота около 36 метров. Мощная крона имеет округлую форму, ствол
   раздваивающийся. Рассеченные большие листовые пластины окрашены в
   насыщенно-зеленый оттенок. В покрытых околоплодником щетинистых плодах
   находится 2–7 семян.

   Такое растение отличается своей неприхотливостью и устойчивостью к
   вредителям и заболеваниям. Оно прекрасно растет и развивается в черте
   города, даже в сильно загрязненной атмосфере. Лучше всего для него
   подходит щелочной грунт, а также теплый и влажный климат. Продолжительный
   засушливый период может навредить дереву. Благодаря пышной листве платан
   улучшает экологическую обстановку в городах, так как он активно обогащает
   воздух кислородом.

Где растет дерево платан

   [IMG][IMG]

   На европейской территории, а еще в Сибири, Дальнем Востоке и Казахстане
   были найдены следы древнейшего платана. Однако на сегодняшний день ареал
   произрастания данного растения более широк, что объясняет появление
   множества разнообразных видов:

     * платан западный встречается в Северной Америке;
     * платан восточный можно увидеть в лесах Малой и Средней Азии, на
       Балканском полуострове и Черноморском побережье, а еще в
       Средиземноморье;
     * платан мексиканский встречается в Северо-Восточной Мексике;
     * платан Керра растет на территории Индокитая (Лаос и Вьетнам);
     * платан Райта украшает территории Мексики и США;
     * родиной платана кистистого является Северная и Центральная Америка.

Посадка и уход

   [IMG][IMG]

  Выбор места

   Чтобы платан рос здоровым и имел эффектный внешний вид, ему необходимо
   большое количество солнечного света, оптимальное количество тепла, при
   этом влажность должна быть умеренной. Специалисты рекомендуют, высаживать
   его только в тех регионах, где климат довольно мягкий.

   Участок должен быть хорошо освещенным и просторным. Он может располагаться
   на равнине или возвышенности. Корневая система разрастается очень сильно,
   в связи с этим высаживая несколько саженцев, меж ними следует соблюдать
   значительную дистанцию. Такое растение не рекомендуется высаживать в
   местах прохождения подземных коммуникаций либо в непосредственной близости
   с постройками.

  Почва

   Такое дерево прекрасно себя чувствует в любой почве. Однако часть видов
   лучше всего растет в известковом грунте. Но нужно следить за тем, чтобы
   грунт был постоянно оптимально влажным, питательным и достаточно рыхлым,
   чтобы кислород мог беспрепятственно поступать к корневой системе.

  Посадка

   [IMG][IMG]

   Прежде всего нужно особое внимание обратить на выбор саженца. Специалисты
   советуют, выбирать наиболее распространенный в конкретном регионе вид. В
   этом случае вы сможете быть уверены в том, что растение хорошо приживется,
   и будет прекрасно расти и развиваться.

   Выбирая саженец, нужно обратить внимание на то, что от корневой шейки
   должен обязательно идти основной корень. Если же его нет, тогда перед вами
   давший корни черенок, а не настоящий саженец. Он намного хуже приживается
   и обладает невысокой устойчивостью к морозам.

   Прежде чем приступить к высадке в грунт, у саженца необходимо срезать все
   листовые пластины. В этом случае все его силы будут пущены на рост системы
   корней и не будут растрачиваться на наращивание листвы. Высаживать саженец
   в грунт крайне нежелательно в конце весеннего или в начале осеннего
   периода.

  Полив

   [IMG][IMG]

   Чтобы недавно высаженный саженец начал интенсивно расти, его необходимо
   систематически поливать. Благодаря своевременному поливу растение вырастит
   мощным и красивым. Если дереву будет не хватать влаги, то это приведет к
   замедлению роста, скручиванию листовых пластин, при этом у них появится
   ржавый оттенок.

   Во время активного роста деревце нуждается в большом количестве
   питательных веществ. Для подкормки рекомендуется использовать минеральный
   комплекс, в состав которого входит оптимальный набор микроэлементов и
   минеральных веществ, например, Кемира.

   Облетевшую листву платана можно использовать в качестве органической
   подкормки для этого же дерева. После того как листья облетят, их оставляют
   под растением. Спустя некоторое время они полностью перегниют и станут
   питательной массой, в которой ко всему прочему могут поселиться полезные
   микроорганизмы. Помимо этого опавшая листва является прекрасным
   мульчирующим слоем, который поможет уберечь корни от сильных морозов.

  Обрезка

   Это растение не обрезают в декоративных целях. Однако обрезку проводят
   тогда, когда есть необходимость сократить массу кроны, либо придать ей
   симметричную или округлую форму. Обрезать растение лучше всего в начале
   весеннего периода, при этом успеть нужно до начала движения сока по
   дереву. Также нужно срезать все сломанные и сухие ветви.

  Зимовка

   Если в регионе в зимнее время бывает холоднее минус 25 градусов, тогда
   осенью придется провести подготовку дерева к зимовке. Для этого корневую
   систему защищают толстым мульчирующим слоем (еловыми ветвями, опилками или
   облетевшими листьями).

Способы размножения

   Саженец платана можно приобрести готовый либо вырастить самостоятельно из
   семени или из черенка. В южной части России чаще всего культивируют
   эффектный чинар, а в центральной — зимостойкий клинолистный вид.

  Выращивание из семян

   [IMG][IMG]

   Чтобы вырастить саженец из семян своими руками, необходимо затратить
   довольно много времени и сил. Для начала нужно подготовить семенной
   материал. Возьмите вызревшее соплодие и отделите семена, их следует
   ссыпать в тканевый мешочек. Затем их подвергают яровизации: процедура
   помогает адаптироваться семенам к холоду. Для этого семенной материал
   прямо в мешочке закапывают в песок либо почву и убирают в прохладное место
   (0–10 градусов) до весны. В результате семена закаливаются и
   дезинфицируются.

   В весеннее время семенной материал на 30 минут помещают в розоватый
   раствор марганцевого калия, после чего его проращивают путем замачивания в
   прохладной воде. Когда появятся первые росточки, проводят высадку семян в
   горшочки, наполненные песком, смешанным с торфом. Их следует высадить на
   глубину всего 0,2 см. Укройте посевы сверху пленкой, так как они нуждаются
   в постоянном тепле и высокой влажности.

   Когда покажутся сеянцы, укрытие следует убрать. Постарайтесь поменьше
   тревожить ростки, при этом им нужно обеспечить оптимальное количество
   света и тепла. Когда система корней будет достаточно мощной, саженцы
   высаживают в открытый грунт.

  Черенкование

   Заготовку черенков проводят глубокой осенью. Выберите не больную хорошо
   развитую боковую ветвь и обрежьте черенок, который в длину должен
   достигать примерно 0,4 м. Поставьте отрезок в раствор средства,
   стимулирующего рост корней, срезом вниз. Когда в весеннее время на нем
   сформируются почки и зачатки корней, можно будет провести посадку в почву.
   Высадку саженца проводят в увлажненный грунт, при этом заглубить его нужно
   на 2/3. Растение нуждается в хорошем уходе, пока оно не адаптируется и не
   наберет сил.

  Корневые отпрыски и отводки

   У взрослого платана на корнях нередко образуются детки. Хорошо развитые
   корневые отпрыски можно отрезать вместе с частью корня. Их высадку в
   открытый грунт проводят в осеннее или весеннее время. Они нуждаются в
   обильном поливе. Присыпьте приствольный круг мульчей, чтобы кустик быстрее
   прижился. Мульчирующий слой не даст корням замерзнуть в зимнее время, а в
   летние месяцы поможет сохранить влагу в почве.

   Для размножения отводками подходит только молодое деревце. Выберите нижнюю
   ветвь и сделайте на ней маленький разрез. Пригните ее к поверхности почвы
   и пришпильте. Место, где сделан разрез, закидывают землей, которую хорошо
   увлажняют. Обычно корни появляются довольно быстро. Останется лишь
   отделить отводок от родительского деревца и посадить его на постоянное
   место.

   Это дерево довольно быстрорастущее. Если за ним хорошо ухаживать, то
   спустя пару лет оно будет иметь высоту около 100–150 см.

Болезни и вредители

   [IMG][IMG]

   Для платана наибольшую опасность представляют грибковые заболевания. У
   пораженного дерева на поверхности коры образуется налет темного оттенка.
   Спустя некоторое время начинают сохнуть ветви, а потом погибает все
   растение. Нередко грибковые болезни переносят древесные вредители
   (платановая кружевница). В связи с этим в профилактических целях
   рекомендуются обработки инсектицидными средствами: Актеллик, Актара,
   Карбофос и др.

   Такое грибковое заболевание как антракноз повреждает листья. Из-за этой
   болезни меняется окрас листвы, на ней образуются трещинки. Избавиться от
   болезни можно с помощью фунгицидных препаратов: бордосская смесь или
   Фундазол.

Применение и значение

   [IMG][IMG]

   Кора, плоды, древесина и листва платана нашли широкое применение в
   различных сферах:

    1. Ценная древесина является высококачественной, прочной и имеет
       благородную текстуру. Древесину легко обрабатывать, поэтому ее широко
       применяют в производстве поделок из дерева и мебели. Поверхность
       обладает благородным красновато-золотистым окрасом. Внешне напоминает
       кожу змеи.
    2. В состав целебных листьев входят мирицетин, флавоноиды и кофейная
       кислота. Экстракт из листвы оказывает благоприятное влияние на кожный
       покров, сосуды и нервную систему. В коре содержится очень много
       бетулина и его соединений, поэтому она отличается ранозаживляющим,
       вяжущим и антисептическим действием.
    3. Большинство видов являются высокодекоративными, поэтому ими озеленяют
       скверы и сады в городах. Они насыщают воздух кислородом и очищают его
       от вредных примесей.

Платан в ландшафтном дизайне

   [IMG][IMG]

   Раскидистая густая крона платана поможет создать живописный тенистый
   уголок в саду. Как правило, под растением создают зону отдыха, где можно
   отдохнуть от жары.

   Применяют такие деревья и в ландшафтном дизайне в южных регионах. Ими
   украшают городские улицы. Они смотрятся очень эффектно с яркими
   кустарниками. Культивируют платан и в качестве сольного растения
   (солитера).

Самые потрясающие деревья мира

   Это стоит видеть каждому

   Человек считает себя умнее растений. Но одно великое растение важнее и
   привлекательнее сотни тысяч якобы умных и красивых людей (речь,
   безусловно, не о нас, но вы поняли). Легендарные деревья — это тадж-махалы
   и кремли неокультуренной природы. Подходить к ним надо строго босиком,
   выключив мобилы, спрашивая разрешение на съемку и прикосновение. А
   прикоснувшись, разок, мизинчиком, — навсегда прекратить глумиться над
   тетками, которые заключают могучие растения в теплые объятия.

   Вот они, самые великие из необычных деревьев матушки-планеты.

   1. Одинокий кипарис на полуострове Монтерей

                               Знаменитые деревья
   Это Калифорния, но природа здесь очень похожа на Южный берег Крыма. Только
   мусора поменьше и сервис получше. И поболее миллионеров, местной элиты,
   которая любит отдыхать на живописном пляже Пеббл Бич. На одинокой скале
   растет очень одинокий кипарис. Много сотен лет общается с резвыми
   океанскими волнами.
                               Знаменитые деревья
   К старости своей одинокий кипарис стал таким же узнаваемым символом
   калифорнийского побережья, как ворота Карадага — символом крымской
   курортной неги. На фоне кипариса фотографируются и снимают фильмы, а в
   1990 году его «брендировали», превратив в торговую марку Западного Берега,
   охраняемую законом. То есть, стоит теперь это грустное дерево много денег.
   Которые платят туристы за удовольствие познакомиться с
   красавцем-кипарисом. И повыпендриваться.
                               Знаменитые деревья

   2. Деревья-циркачи Акселя Эрландсона

   Господин Эрландсон, швед по национальности, американец по жизни (умер в
   1964 г), гениальный ботаник, самый терпеливый человек своего времени,
   шестьдесят лет назад в своем имении организовал аттракцион с деревьями
   крайне необычной рукотворной формы. Так его и назвал — «Цирк деревьев».

                               Знаменитые деревья
   Кудесник Аксель создал более 70 живых скульптур из платанов, а секрет унес
   с собой в могилу. На сегодняшний день из деревьев Эрландсона, которых
   трижды пересаживали новые и новые хозяева, переезжая с места на место,
   остались живы лишь двадцать пять. За их осмотр по-прежнему берут плату.

   3. Дуб-часовня из деревни Алувиль-Белефос

   Старейший дуб и самое знаменитое дерево во Франции. Высота дерева — 18
   метров, а окружность в самом толстом месте — 16 метров. Дубу более тысячи
   лет.

                               Знаменитые деревья
   В 1669 году в его дупле было оборудовано две часовни, которые ежегодно
   посещает до 40 тысяч паломников. По сей день священный дуб производит
   желуди. Люди берегут его, как могут, и верят, что великое дерево будет
   жить вечно.

   4. Трепетный гигант по имени Пандо

   Этот осиновый лес в штате Юта (США) — на самом деле единый живой организм,
   несколько тысяч генетически идентичных клонов одного мужского растения с
   монструозной корневой системой, возраст которой оценивается в 80 000 (!)
   лет. Имя «Пандо» в переводе с латинского означает «я расширяюсь».

                               Знаменитые деревья
                               Знаменитые деревья
   Трепетный гигант пережил множество пожаров, которые уничтожали на корню
   главного конкурента осины, хвойные деревья. Колония клонов была открыта в
   1970 году, она занимает площадь 43 гектара. Средний возраст стволов — 130
   лет, о чем говорят годичные кольца. Пандо включен в список «40 чудес
   Америки», ему посвящены многочисленные почтовые марки, рекламные буклеты и
   ученые диссертации. Вампиры и прочая нечисть обходят осиновое
   царство-государство тридесятой дорогой.
                               Знаменитые деревья

   5. Кипарис Монтезумы

   Самый толстый, самый сучковатый кипарис на земле обитает в мексиканском
   городе Оахака. Дурацкие легенды гласят, будто это могучее древо в своей
   толще способно рожать зверей — ягуаров и даже слонов (коих с роду не
   водилось в Америке). Морды диких животных видятся упившимся текилой
   домашним синьорам в хитросплетениях сучков гиганта.

                               Знаменитые деревья
                               Знаменитые деревья
   Диаметр ствола кипариса Монтрезумы — почти 12 метров. Да, слон поместится.
   И еще с десяток крупных кошек. Когда туристы, выстроившись в цепь,
   пытаются обнять дерево, они с удивлением обнаруживают, что все происходит
   наоборот — кипарис обнимает людей.
                               Знаменитые деревья
   Возраст великого растения — полторы тысячи лет. В 1984 году царь-кипарис
   чуть было не погиб, стал усыхать. Но биологи и инженеры сообразили, как
   ему помочь и наполнили ткани влагой. Жизнь “древа жизни” продолжается.
                               Знаменитые деревья

   6. Баньяновое дерево Бодхи

   Ом мани падме хум, товарищи!

                               Знаменитые деревья
   Всевышний создал баньяновые деревья для того, чтобы белые туристы,
   прилетев на крыльях любопытства в Южную или Юго-Восточную Азию, обливались
   потом и сгорали от изумления при виде многочисленных воздушных корней, не
   все из коих достигают земли, и которые так похожи на щупальца, которыми
   небо хочет потрогать грешных и приземленных людишек.
                               Знаменитые деревья
   Баньяновые деревья названы так из-за торговцев-баньянов, раскладывавших
   свой товар в тени массивных крон этих гигантских фикусов. А в дуплах они
   прятали “левую” выручку от сборщиков податей
                               Знаменитые деревья
   Самым знаменитым “сидельцем под баньяном” был Будда Гаутама. 25 веков
   назад, медитируя под фикусом, царевич достиг просветления. Было это на
   Шри-Ланке и продолжалось 49 дней. Дерево Бодхи, к которому приходят
   молиться паломники наших дней — это пра-пра-правнук того самого
   баньянового дерева, у которого Будда прозрел. Хотя многие думают, что это
   и есть тот самый священный фикус. Ну и пусть думают. Для монахов нет
   разницы: свято само место, а не воздушные корни.

   7. Мафусаил и Прометей — старейшие деревья планеты

   Самое почтенное из ныне живущих деревьев растет в Белых горах Калифорнии.
   Эта остистая сосна названа Мафусаилом в честь библейского персонажа,
   который прожил 969 лет.

                               Знаменитые деревья
   Сосна по имени Мафусаил старше своего сказочного тёзки более чем в пять
   раз. Дереву этому — 4840 лет. До тех пор, пока в 1957 году ученые не
   вычислили возраст хвойного долгожителя, самыми пожилыми растениями на
   Земле считались гигантские 2000-летние секвойи.
                               Знаменитые деревья

   Трагична история другого древнего дерева, по имени Прометей. В 1964 году
   студент Дональд Карри исследовал ствол Прометея, брал образцы древесины.
   Бурильный аппарат сломался и застрял в дереве, лесник дал добро на то,
   чтобы спилить сосну целиком. Каково же было удивление и самоуничижение
   студента, когда, подсчитав годичные кольца, он понял, что убил растение,
   которое успело «отметить» 5000-летний юбилей.

   Где-то здесь, среди других титанов, Прометей родился, вырос, состарился и
   погиб:

                               Знаменитые деревья
   А вот евойный пень:
                               Знаменитые деревья

   С тех пор все старые остистые сосны-патриархи Калифорнии находятся под
   строгой защитой и посторонних в заповедник их произрастания не пускают.

   8. Баобаб-туалет и баобаб-паб

   Дерево баобаб знаменито своими необычными пропорциями. У него рыхлая
   древесина, которая в дождливые сезоны впитывает много влаги, и поэтому у
   баобабов такие толстые стволы. Настолько толстые, что внутри можно
   оборудовать, к примеру, ватерклозет для стеснительных белых туристов
   (настоящие африканцы оправляются, где приспичит):

                               Знаменитые деревья
   Этот бао-туалето-баб сфотографирован на турбазе Кайила Лодж в Замбии. А в
   провинции Лимпопо, в стволе самого толстого на свете баобаба в 1990 году
   предприимчивые белые фермеры открыли пивную с платным входом:
                               Знаменитые деревья
                               Знаменитые деревья
   9. Одинокое дерево пустыни Тенере
   Пустыня Тенере является частью Сахары и расположена на западе Чада и
   северо-востоке Нигера. До 1973 года в самом центре Тенере росла самая
   одинокая акация в мире. Ее корни извлекали воду с глубины 36 метров, ее
   крона служила ориентиром для караванщиков. В радиусе 200 км не наблюдалось
   ни единой живой растительной души. 300-летнее дерево являлось табу для
   туарегов и их верблюдов — с одинокой акации нельзя было сорвать и листика.
                               Знаменитые деревья
                               Знаменитые деревья
   В ноябре 1973 г пьяный водитель грузовика, гражданин Ливии, наехал на
   акацию и сломал ее. Останки дерева доставили в Национальный музей Нигера,
   а на месте инцидента добрые трезвые люди воздвигли металлический памятник.

Самое дорогое дерево Великобритании

   Определена стоимость самого дорогого дерева Великобритании.

   Она в три раза превышает среднюю стоимость английского жилого дома и
   составляет 750 000 фунтов. Самое дорогое дерево – платан викторианской
   эпохи с диаметром ствола 1,8 м – стоит в Лондоне, на площади Беркли. Эта
   сумма может показаться огромной; между тем, в таких богатых районах
   Лондона, как Кенсингтон, Челси и Вестминстер, растут десятки деревьев
   стоимостью более 500 000 фунтов каждое. Согласно Системе оценки стоимости
   столичных древесных насаждений (Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees,
   CAVAT), в сумме цена этих деревьев составляет примерно миллиард фунтов.

   Система разработана Лондонской ассоциацией инспекторов по древесным
   насаждениям (The London Tree Officers Association, LTOA), объединением
   работников в сфере озеленения и арбористики. Новый подход применяется как
   к зеленым массивам, так и отдельным деревьям, выражая их ценность в
   денежном эквиваленте. По сути это экономический инструмент защиты
   городских деревьев от вырубки, представляющий их в качестве материальных
   ценностей. Система CAVAT оценивает насаждения по размерам, здоровью,
   исторической значимости, а также по плотности окрестного населения (т.е.
   по тому, сколько человек могут наслаждаться близостью дерева).

   CAVAT начнет работать в Лондоне в этом году и будет распространена на всю
   Великобританию в следующем году. Эксперты утверждают, что это остановит
   рубку деревьев, из-за которых, по словам чиновников, происходят оседания
   фундаментов домов. Пользуясь этим предлогом, за последние пять лет
   Лондонский совет снес около 40 000 уличных деревьев, а это больше, чем за
   предыдущие 100 лет. Однако с введением системы CAVAT уничтожать деревья
   станет значительно труднее. Ведь чем выше цена дерева, тем больше
   доказательств причиняемого им ущерба надо будет представить страховщикам.

   Председатель ассоциации Энди Типпинг сказал: «Люди пока не понимают, что
   оседание – проблема зданий, а не деревьев. Часто эту проблему вызывают
   плохой дренаж, некачественный ремонт или изменения климата. Внедрение
   новой системы CAVAT изменит ситуацию ко всеобщему благу».

   Самые старые деревья на планете
   [IMG]

Самые старые деревья на планете

   Недавно группа специалистов под руководством Лейфа Куллмана обследовала
   растущую в Швеции канадскую ель.

   Канадская ель

    

   На вид дерево молодое и стройное, однако оно является новым побегом, то
   есть фактически «клоном», росшей на этом месте древней ели, которой уже
   больше 9550 лет. Таким образом, это сейчас самое старое отдельное дерево
   на нашей планете. Неподалеку от него возвышаются и другие клоны, корням
   которых 5660 и 9000 лет.

   Самой древней на Земле  признана и колония тополей в штате Юта (США). Этот
   единый организм, состоящий почти из пятидесяти тысяч генетически
   идентичных деревьев, имеющих общую корневую систему, постоянно
   воспроизводит себя, обеспечивая собственное бессмертие.

   Колония тополей в штате Юта

   Относительно возраста колонии ученые пока не пришли к единому мнению.
   Некоторые полагают, что дерево-основатель проросло более 80 тысяч лет
   назад, другие же считают, что возраст этого гигантского организма с общим
   весом в шесть с лишним тысяч тонн превышает 800 тысяч лет.

   Трагически закончилась судьба сосны вида Pinus longaeva по имени Прометей
   (Prometheus). Это самое старое из известных неклонированных деревьев, к
   сожалению, было спилено в 1964 году работниками Федерального лесного
   управления США в ходе научных изысканий некоего соискателя степени
   магистра.

   Прометей (Prometheus)

   Уже после гибели реликта было точно установлено, что его возраст составлял
   около 5000 лет. Сосна росла в штате Невада на северо-восточном склоне горы
   Уилера в Национальном парке «Грейт Бейсин».

   Еще одна сосна того же вида была обнаружена в штате Калифорния, в
   Национальном лесу «Иньо».

   Мафусаил (Methuselah)

   При ее изучении в 1957 году специалисты точно определили, что она проросла
   в 2832 году до нашей эры, а стало быть, ее возраст к тому моменту
   составлял 4789 лет. Дерево названо Мафусаил (Methuselah) по имени одного
   из библейских персонажей, который прожил 969 лет. Сейчас, после гибели
   Прометея, эта сосна считается самым старым индивидуальным
   (неклонированным) живым организмом на нашей планете. Ради безопасности
   местонахождение долгожителя сохраняется в тайне.

   В Иране, в провинции Язд (Yazd), обнаружен кипарис, получивший имя
   Сарв-э-Абарку (Sarv-e-Abarqu).

   Сарв-э-Абарку (Sarv-e-Abarqu)

   Иногда его также называют Зороатрина Сарв (Zoroatrina Sarv). Возраст
   дерева, по прикидкам специалистов, составляет около 4000 лет.

   Тис в возрасте приблизительно 4000 лет растет во дворе приходской церкви в
   селе Ллангернью (Llangernyw) в Уэльсе.

   Ллангернью (Llangernyw)

   В июне 2002 года по случаю празднования «золотого юбилея» королевы
   Елизаветы II этот реликт признан национальным достоянием Великобритании.

   Фицройя кипарисовидная ( Fitzroya cupressoides) считается вторым после
   Мафусаила деревом-долгожителем на Земле, чей возраст был точно определен в
   1993 году при подсчете годовых колец.

   Алерке (Alerce)

   Ей 3622 года, она растет на юге Чили в береговом заказнике. В тропических
   дождевых лесах находится и много других древних деревьев этого вида,
   которые здесь называют Алерке (Alerce).

   Самый большой и самый древний в США кипарис вида Taxodium distichum по
   имени Сенатор (Senator) находится в Парке Больших Деревьев (Big Tree Park)
   во Флориде.

   Сенатор (Senator)

   Назван кипарис в честь сенатора штата М. О. Оверстрита, который отдал это
   дерево и окружающий участок земли под устройство парка. Возраст Сенатора
   составляет сейчас 3400-3500 лет.

   Среди других деревьев-долгожителей можно вспомнить можжевеловое дерево в
   штате Юта.

   Можжевеловое дерево в штате Юта

   Его возраст первоначально оценили в 3200 лет, а сейчас снизили до 1500.

   Оливковое дерево на Крите

   Оливковому дереву на Крите (на снимке вверху) – 2000 лет. До сих пор дают
   плоды две оливы на Аравийском полуострове и пять в Израиле, достигшие
   примерно 3000 лет. Олива на Сардинии чуть постарше – ей от 3000 до 4000
   лет. Возраст растущего в Бразилии дерева абарко (Cariniana legalis),
   которое прозвали «Красавец-патриарх» (Patriarca da Floresta), оценивается
   в 3000 лет (на снимке внизу).

   «Красавец-патриарх» (Patriarca da Floresta)

   Ведется поиск и других деревьев-долгожителей, для определения их возраста
   делаются особые надрезы. К сожалению, у некоторых видов годовые кольца
   отсутствуют или слабо выражены, и оценить, сколько им лет, пока
   невозможно.

   Топ-10 самых известных деревьев в мире, по версии свободной энциклопедии –
   Википедия.

    1.   1. Бодхи, город Анурадхапура — самое знаменитое и самое старое на
            Шри-Ланке дерево, это дерево было выращено из семени дерева Шри
            Маха Бодхи на Шри Ланке, которое, в свою очередь, произошло от
            оригинального дерева Махабодхи, под которым Будда нашёл
            Просветление.

    1.   1. Гиперион (секвойя), самая высокая из известных деревьев –
            секвойя, достигает высоты 115,5 м растет на западном побережье
            Америки – это самое высокое дерево в мире.

    1.   1. Дуб кайзера, знаменитый дуб в берлинском районе Фриденау,
            охраняемый памятник природы, посаженный 22 марта 1879 г. в честь
            императора (кайзера) Вильгельма I по случаю золотой свадьбы с его
            супругой Августой Саксонско-Веймарско-Айзенахской и 82-летия
            кайзера. В то время было принято сажать деревья в честь кайзера.

                        10 интересных фактов о деревьях

   Деревья сопровождают нас всегда и везде. Важно помнить, что дерево – не
   только очень ценный природный материал, но и один из самых крупных живых
   организмов нашей планеты. Мы собрали для вас интересные факты, которые вы
   могли не знать.

   1) Леса Финляндии занимают примерно 70% площади страны, в то время как
   доля леса в Великобритании составляет около 6%. Такая ситуация сложилась
   из-за периода промышленной революции;

   2) Секвойя – самое высокое дерево на планете, однако её древесина не особо
   пригодна для бытовых нужд из-за своей хрупкости;

   3) Не все деревья безобидны – сок манцинеллового дерева токсичен, а его
   пары могут негативно повлиять на глаза и дыхательную систему человека (в
   наших широтах вы вряд ли его встретите);

   4) В северном полушарии растёт больше 100 видов сосны, а в южном, до
   недавнего времени, всего 1 (пока не появились искусственно посаженные
   сосновые леса);

   5) В Бразилии растёт «нефтяное дерево» – копаифера. Состав его сока
   практически ничем не отличается от дизельного топлива;

   6) Почти половина всех хвойных деревьев находится на территории России;

   7) В среднем за жизнь дерево поглощает порядка тонны углекислого газа;

   8) Корица – высушенная кора деревьев из Южной Индии и Шри-Ланки;

   9) «Железная» берёза или берёза Шмидта – дерево, которое у вряд ли
   получится срубить топором;

   10) Самое большое дерево – «Генерал Шерман» находится в "Гигантском лесу"
   Калифорнии. Его высота составляет 83,8м, а возраст – 2300-2700 лет.

                       Самые интересные факты о деревьях

     * [ Submit ][ Submit ]

   Деревья – одни из важнейших живых организмов на нашей планете. Их
   интересно наблюдать, рядом с ними приятно гулять, а еще интересно узнавать
   невероятные факты. В нашей подборке – десять интересных сведений о
   деревьях.

   Деревьев не существовало 90% времени жизни планеты

   Большую часть истории планеты, которая насчитывает 4,5 миллиарда лет,
   деревьев не существовало. Они появились 470 миллионов лет назад в виде мха
   без прочных корней, а первые сосудистые растения появились 420милионов лет
   назад и не росли выше 1 метра.

   В процессе эволюции деревьям пришлось «учиться» расти на стволе и
   развивать систему передачи питательных веществ от корня. Считается, что
   первыми такими растениями были папоротниковые, которые не имели листьев.

   Дерево юрского периода

   Волемия благородная – вечнозеленое дерево, которое растет на 25-40 метров
   в высоту. Его остатки находили в окаменелостях Юрского периода и считали
   вымершим более 150 миллионов лет назад. Однако в 1994 году деревья этого
   вида обнаружили в одном из национальных парков Австралии. Сегодня на
   планете сохраняется около 80 взрослых деревьев этого вида.

   На планете существует более 60 тысяч видов деревьев

   В 2017 году группа ученых собрала в единый каталог все данные из музеев,
   ботанических садов и агрокультурных центров по всему миру. Таким образом,
   было установлено, что сегодня на планете существует 60065 видов деревьев,
   известных науке.

   Более половины видов деревьев – эндемики

   Кроме количества известных видов, ученые также исследовали, где и как они
   растут. Оказывается, что около 58% всех видов деревьев – эндемичные, то
   есть распространены на территории только одного региона или страны.
   Лидерами по количеству эндемичных видов стали Бразилия, Колумбия и
   Индонезия.

   Целый лес из одной осины

   В заповеднике Fishlake National Forest (штат Юта, США), растет целый лес,
   имеющий единую корневую систему. Пандо (англ. Pando) – это клональная
   колония отдельного дерева, о чем свидетельствуют исследования ДНК.
   Насаждения занимают площадь в 43,6 гектара, а общий вес деревьев по
   оценкам мог бы составлять 6,6 тысяч тонн. Возраст корневой системы Пандо
   оценивается в 80 тысяч лет, что делает его одной из самых древних живых
   организмов.

   Дерево со взрывающимися плодами

   Дерево Гура (Hura Crepitans), известное также как хурма виргинская,
   распространено в тропических лесах Южной Америки узнаваемо по своей
   гладкой светлой коре, покрытой острыми прямым шипами. Оно может вырастать
   до 60 метров в высоту и выращивать листья до 60 сантиметров. Самая
   известная особенность Гуры – ее плоды, которые, созрев, могут взрываться и
   стрелять семенами со скоростью до 70 метров в секунду в радиусе до 100
   метров.

   Наиболее ядовитое дерево на планете

   Дерево манцинелы (Hippomane mancinella) считают самым ядовитым деревом из
   известных на сегодня – его сок из коры, листьев или плодов содержит
   большое количество токсинов. Даже просто стоять под деревом во время дождя
   не стоит – капли воды с соком листьев вызовут сильную аллергическую
   реакцию на коже. Известны даже случаи, когда повреждалась краска на
   автомобилях.

   Гипотеза Да Винчи

   Леонардо Да Винчи предполагал, что толщина всех ветвей кроны дерева всегда
   равна толщине его ствола. Проще говоря, если «причесать» вверх все ветви и
   сжать их, они будут иметь такую же толщину как ствол дерева. Ученый из
   университета Прованса во Франции методом компьютерного моделирования
   доказал, что это предположение может быть истинным.

   Собственный тропический лес

   Индийский лесовод Джадав Паенг начал высаживать деревья на песчаном
   пустыре, когда ему было 16 лет. Сейчас индийцу 47 и он имеет собственный
   тропический лес площадью 550 гектаров. По подтвержденным данным здесь
   проживают бенгальские тигры, индийские носороги, слоны, олени, обезьяны и
   различные виды птиц.

   Фундамент Венеции

   Фундаментом Венецианских островов служат плотно расположенные деревянные
   сваи из ольхи. Благодаря тому, что древесина остается погруженной в воду,
   она не гниет и не трухнет уже более тысячи лет. Более того, благодаря
   минералам, содержащиеся в воде, сваи постепенно каменеют.

   В 2015 году ученые подсчитали, что на нашей планете растет не менее 3
   триллионов деревьев. Рекордсменом по их количеству является Россия, т.к. у
   нас их насчитывается не менее 640 млрд.

   Известно более 60 тыс. видов деревьев. Их можно разделить на хвойные,
   вечнозеленые, и лиственные. В свою очередь, вторые делятся на
   широколиственные (ясень, бук, клен), листопадные и вечнозеленые. Если вы
   хотите узнать больше об этих растениях, читайте 10 интересных фактов о
   деревьях.

10. Лес – легкие планеты

   Примерно треть всей суши занимают леса. Растениям необходима энергия
   света, чтобы синтезировать органические вещества. Этот процесс называется
   фотосинтезом. Побочным его продуктом является кислород.

   Только благодаря растениям мы можем дышать, т.к. именно они производят 99%
   кислорода, и лишь 1% поступает из мантии нашей планеты. Ночью, когда
   процесс фотосинтеза невозможен, деревья и другие растения начинают
   потреблять кислород, но расходуют они его в меньших количествах, чем
   производят.

   Выработкой кислорода занимаются не только деревья, но и все растения,
   населяющие нашу планету, в том числе и микроскопические водоросли,
   образующие фитопланктон.

9. Общая площадь лесов на Земле составляет почти треть поверхности суши

   Лес на нашей планете занимает около 38 млн. км², т.е. деревья занимают
   около трети всей суши. К началу XXI века люди уничтожили около 50% лесов,
   существовавших на планете. Они попытались как-то компенсировать тот ущерб,
   что нанесли природе, и высадили новые леса, но они занимают не более 7 %
   всей территории, отведенной для деревьев.

   Леса нужно возрождать, т.к. только благодаря ним очищается воздух, они
   поглощают промышленные загрязнения, многие деревья выделяют фитонциды,
   обладающие бактерицидными свойствами.

   В хвойных лесах практически стерильный воздух. Если чаще бывать на
   природе, повышается иммунитет, улучшается обмен веществ, успокаивается
   нервная система и т.д.

8. Тайга занимает около 79% территории всей России

   Наша страна занимает огромную территорию, и 79% всей этой земли покрыто
   тайгой. Это особая ландшафтная зона с болотистой почвой, где растут
   деревья хвойных пород. Ширина этой полосы – 800 км, но на
   востоке Сибири она становится еще больше – до 2200 км.

   Зима здесь продолжается 10 месяцев. Большинство животных в это время
   впадает в спячку. Зимой температура может опускаться до -60 градусов, а
   летом поднимается до +35 градусов. Тайга богата пушным зверем, здесь можно
   увидеть более 800 видов цветов, 300 разновидностей птиц, некоторые из
   которых занесены в Красную книгу.

7. Самое распространённое в мире лиственное дерево — берёза

   В Северном полушарии, в том числе и на территории России, одним из самых
   распространенных лиственных растений является береза. Насчитывается более
   100 видов березы. Это важнейшая лесообразующая порода, которая может расти
   практически везде, т.к. не требовательна к почве, живет достаточно долго
   (100-120 лет, отдельные деревья доживают до 400 лет), быстро растет, если
   сравнивать с другими.

   Как только в лесу освобождается место из-за вырубок или пожаров, первыми
   его начинают обживать молодые березки, которые в дальнейшем могут быть
   вытеснены елями.

6. Одно из самых твёрдых в мире деревьев — берёза Шмидта

   Другое название этого дерева – береза железная. Она была названа в честь
   ботаника Федора Шмидта, который первым обнаружил этот вид. Встречается не
   так часто, у нас растет только на юге Приморского края, а также
   в Китае, Японии и Корейском полуострове. Она доживает до 350 лет.

   Древесина у березы Шмидта тяжелая и твердая, она тонет в воде, отличается
   особой прочностью. Обычно это высокое дерево, до 25 м, некоторые из них
   вырастают до 35 м, с диаметром ствола от 70 до 80 см. У них бежевая,
   сероватая кора, у молодых саженцев она почти коричневая, а у веток –
   темного, вишневого оттенка.

5. Из одного дерева можно получить около 60 кг бумаги

   Для получения бумаги нужна не древесина, а целлюлоза, для производства
   которой используются некоторые лесные породы.

   Специальные станки убирают с деревьев кору, а само дерево измельчают в
   мелкие щепки. Потом их смешивают с водой и обрабатывают, прессуют,
   отглаживают. Таким способом делают газетную бумагу.

   Если нужна более качественная, целлюлозу необходимо обработать химическими
   материалами. Из таких листов можно печатать тетради или книги.

   Для получения бумаги высшего сорта, древесный материал варят, промывают,
   фильтруют, после чего прессуют, раскатывают и разглаживают, а потом сушат
   при определенной температуре.

4. Самые высокие в мире деревья — секвойи

   Секвойя вечнозеленая родом из Северной Америки. Они могут прожить до 2
   тыс. лет, вырасти до 110 м. Это дерево с конической кроной и
   горизонтальными ветвями, с толстой, до 30 см толщиной, корой
   красно-коричневого цвета. Часто вырастают до 60-90 м.

   Но самым большим деревом на Земле был назван один из экземпляров этого
   дерева, который получил имя «Гиперион». Его высота – 115, 61 м. Оно растет
   в Калифорнии (США), в национальном парке «Редвуд». Его обнаружили в 2006
   году.

3. Сибирь — самое лесное место России

   Сибирь, если не считать Дальний Восток, занимает площадь в 12 млн. кв. км,
   и где-то две трети всей этой территории – таежные леса. Они начинаются в
   Европейской части нашей страны, покрывают весь Урал, Алтай, и всю
   Западную, Восточную Сибирь, захватывая и Дальний Восток. Простираются на 9
   тыс. километров.

   Тайга – это примерно 80% всего лесного фонда нашей страны. Она, как и
   другие леса, занимает почти половину территории нашей страны (45%), а если
   брать мировую площадь лесов – целых 17%. Северное полушарие Земли
   обогащается кислородом благодаря этому лесу.

2. Крона дуба за год вырастает примерно на один метр

   Желуди прорастают очень медленно, т.к. сначала формируется и растет
   корень, а только потом появляется надземная часть.

   Первые несколько лет дуб растет очень медленно. Саженец в 30-50 см длиной
   должен расти 4-6 лет. Именно в таком возрасте его можно пересаживать на
   постоянное место. В 5-7 лет молодой дуб вырастает до 1 м, именно с 5-10
   лет начинается его интенсивный рост.

   Есть некоторые виды дуба, например, краснолистный, который растет быстрее.
   Сказать точно, на сколько именно вытянется конкретное дерево в год,
   сложно, т.к. у каждого растения своя скорость роста. Но в год дуб
   увеличивается примерно на 1 м, т.е. за 10 лет может вырасти на 8-9 м и
   больше.

1. Меньше всего леса среди стран Европы в Великобритании

   Когда-то на территории Великобритании росли огромные лиственные леса.
   Здесь проживали кельты, поклоняющиеся деревьям, особенно дубам, относились
   к ним с почтением и трепетом.

   Но вскоре эти земли завоевали англосаксонские племена, которые стали
   вырубать леса и возделывать землю. Этот процесс продолжался не одно
   столетие, и в результате к концу ХХ века площадь лесов в этой стране
   сократилась до 10% всей территории острова.

   Сейчас там можно встретить смешанные или таежные леса. Самые
   распространенные деревья на этой территории – бук, береза и дуб. В горах
   раскинулись вересковые пустоши, которые стали пастбищами для овец, а также
   встречаются торфяники.

   Равнины – это пашни и луга, они густо заселены. Огромные лесные массивы
   сменили небольшие редколесья. Но, несмотря на это, Англия кажется зеленой
   страной благодаря живым изгородям, лепополосам, различным фермерским
   лесопосадкам.

   Ішов лісом мисливець.
   Раптом йому назустріч — величезний кабан.
   Ну, чоловік не розгубився і бабах у нього з обох стволів.
   Все навколо в диму, ні хріну не видно, а мужик стоїть і думає:
   – Попав я чи не попав?
   Дим розсіюється… він бачить — стоїть кабан:
   – Ну, мужику, ти попав!

   Какие бывают деревья, из чего они состоят и для чего нужны?

   детям о деревьях

   Деревья очищают и увлажняют воздух, создают прохладу, дают плоды.
   Спиленные деревья являются строительным материалом и сырьем: из высушенных
   стволов делают доски, бумагу.

   Деревья бывают дикорастущими: береза, дуб, ель, ива, каштан, клен, липа,
   осина, осина, ольха, сосна, тополь, ясень. Такие деревья растут в парках,
   вдоль дорог, в лесу.

   Еще деревья бывают плодовыми: яблоня, груша, вишня, абрикос, алыча, слива,
   рябина. Такие деревья люди выращивают в саду, ведь они дают вкусные
   съедобные плоды. 

   школьникам о лесе

   В дереве выделяют три основные части: корень, ствол и крона.

   Корень дерева — это, как правило, подземная часть растения. Благодаря
   корню дерево обеспечивается питательными веществами из почвы.

   Ствол дерева служит опорой для кроны, а также осуществляет передачу
   веществ между корнями и кроной. Снаружи ствол покрыт корой.

   Крона дерева — совокупность веток и листьев в верхней части растения.
   Осенью листья многих деревьев приобретает желтые, оранжевые и красные
   оттенки и опадают с деревьев. Но есть и вечнозеленые деревья, например,
   ель и сосна.

   У каждого дерева  -  свои отличительные особенности.

   Береза  - это дерево с  белым, тонким, стройным стволом. Березовые 
   соцветия называют березовыми сережками. Весной из березы получают
   березовый сок.

   Дуб – это мощное дерево, лесной долгожитель, имеет листья округлой формы и
   очень пышную крону. Дуб хорошо узнаваем благодаря его плодам - желудям.

   Клен – это дерево с красивыми листьями, осенью его разноцветные листья
   являются украшением любого парка. Плод клена называется двукрылаткой:
   после созревания он распадается на две половинки (крылатки), которые летят
   по воздуху и переносят семена.

   Яблоня  – самое распространенное садовое дерево. Она очень неприхотлива и
   отлично приживается даже там, где не могут расти другие плодовые деревья.
   Существует очень много сортов яблонь. Плоды яблони -  это яблоки, они
   очень полезны.

               детям о деревьях детям о деревьях детям о деревьях

   Чтобы ребенок уверенно запомнил не только названия деревьев, но и их
   внешний вид, распечатывайте из Интернет их изображения, разрезайте на
   части и предлагайте собирать мозаику. 

   о деревьях детям

   Накануне любой летней прогулки изучите в энциклопедии или в Википедии
   изображение листьев одного только дерева и найдите на прогулке как минимум
   пять деревьев с такими же листочками. Повторяйте эти уроки каждый год,
   изучая внешний вид знакомых деревьев в разное время года. Исследуйте,
   какими семенами размножается дерево весной, цветут ли на нем цветы, как
   выглядят его осенние листья и голые ветки зимой. Знания о деревьях
   обогатят и словарный запас ребенка, и расширят его кругозор.

   Попробуйте также отгадывать загадки для детей на досуге. Немного
   переключите фокус внимания и взгляните на привычные объекты по-новому!

   Берёза^[2] (лат. Bétula) — род листопадных деревьев и кустарников
   семейства Берёзовые (Betulaceae). Берёза широко распространена в Северном
   полушарии; на территории России принадлежит к числу наиболее
   распространённых древесных пород. Общее число видов — около ста^[3] или
   немного больше^[4]. Многие виды берёзы — широко распространённые и
   важнейшие лесообразующие породы, в значительной мере определяющие облик и
   видовой состав лиственных и хвойно-лиственных (смешанных) лесов в
   умеренной и холодной части Евразии и Северной Америки.

   Многие части берёзы используются в хозяйстве: древесина, кора, берёста
   (поверхностный слой коры), берёзовый сок. Почки и листья применяют в
   медицине: настои из почек и листьев — как мочегонное, бактерицидное,
   ранозаживляющее и жаропонижающее средство, а масляную вытяжку из берёзовых
   почек — как дерматологическое средство. Некоторые виды используют для
   создания полезащитных полос, а также в декоративном садоводстве.

   Берёза занимает важное место в культуре славян, скандинавов,
   финно-угорских и других народов.

Название[править | править код]

   Латинское родовое название было заимствовано из галльского языка^[5].

   Русское слово «берёза» происходит от праслав. *berza (отсюда и белор.
   бяро́за, укр. бере́за, болг. бре́за, сербохорв. бре̏за, словен. brė́za,
   чеш. bříza, польск. brzoza, в.-луж. brěza, н.-луж. brjaza^[6]),
   восходящего к пра-и.е. *b^herĝos (ср. лит. beržas, латыш. bērzs, осет.
   bærž, др.-инд. bhurjah, др.-англ. beorc, англ. birch, нем. Birke,
   нидерл. berk, норв. bjørk, швед. björk), от корня *b^herĝ- «светиться,
   белеть».

   Слово «берёза» родственно словам «берест» (лат. Ulmus),
   «берёста»^[источник не указан 575 дней].

   Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги Köhler’s Medizinal-Pflanzen, 1887

   Большинство видов берёз — деревья высотой до 30 и даже 45 м, с обхватом
   ствола до 120—150 см, некоторые виды — кустарники от крупных до мелких,
   вплоть до стелющихся, едва приподнимающихся над землёй. Все представители
   рода — однодомные раздельнополые ветроопыляемые (анемофильные)
   растения^[8].

   Корневая система берёз мощная, в зависимости от вида и условий
   произрастания либо поверхностная, либо, что чаще, уходит косо вглубь.
   Стержневой корень проростка отмирает очень быстро, зато боковые корни
   развиваются мощно и богаты тонкими мочковидными корешками. Берёза растёт
   медленно только в первые годы. Потом, наоборот, начинает расти быстро, и
   это обеспечивает ей победу над конкурирующей травянистой
   растительностью^[источник не указан 575 дней]. Кора у большей части берёз
   белая, желтоватая, розоватая или красновато-бурая, у некоторых видов
   серая, коричневая или даже чёрная. Полости клеток пробковой ткани на
   стволах заполнены белым смолистым веществом — бетулином, который придаёт
   коре белую окраску^[9]. Внешняя часть — берёста — обычно легко
   отслаивается лентами. У старых деревьев нижняя часть ствола нередко
   покрывается тёмной коркой с глубокими трещинами.

   Листья берёзы очерёдные, цельные, по краю зубчатые, яйцевидно-ромбические
   или треугольно-яйцевидные, моносимметричные, с широким клиновидным
   основанием или почти усечённые, гладкие, до 7 см длиной и 4 см шириной,
   перед опаданием желтеют. Молодые листья клейкие. Жилкование листовой
   пластинки совершенное перисто-нервное (перисто-краебежное): боковые жилки
   оканчиваются в зубцах^[8].

   Почки попеременные, сидячие, покрытые спирально расположенными, часто
   клейкими чешуйками; боковые почки немного отстоящие.

   Мужские цветки в сложных соцветиях — серёжковидных тирсах — появляются ещё
   летом на вершинах удлинённых побегов, обычно по 2—3; сначала они стоячие и
   зелёного цвета, затем постепенно буреют. Их длина 2—4 см. Мужские серёжки
   состоят из многочисленных сросшихся с центральным цветочным стержнем
   щитовидных стебельчатых покровных чешуек, расширенных к вершине,
   снабжённых снизу двумя меньшими чешуйками и содержащих с внутренней
   стороны три цветка. Каждый цветок покрыт также чешуевидным околоцветником,
   в котором помещаются органы оплодотворения — тычинки. Снаружи вся серёжка
   покрыта непроницаемым для влаги смолистым веществом. В таком виде серёжки
   зимуют. Весной, в марте — мае (в зависимости от климата) стержень мужской
   серёжки удлиняется, вследствие чего окружающие цветок чешуйки
   раскрываются, и между ними становятся заметными жёлтые тычинки, обильно
   выделяющие цветочную пыльцу. В это время серёжки, стоявшие раньше прямо,
   сначала наклоняются, а затем и вовсе повисают. Женские серёжки вырастают
   на вершинах укороченных побегов (брахибластов), развивающихся из боковых
   почек прошлогодних побегов, и поэтому сидят всегда на боку ветки.
   Одновременно с зацветанием мужских серёжек распускаются листовые почки и
   женские серёжки. Во время цветения они всегда короче и у́же мужских,
   которые после опыления сразу же опадают. Прицветные (плодовые) чешуйки
   женских серёжек глубоко трёхлопастные; боковые лопасти обычно короче
   средней. Женские цветки (то есть одна лишь завязь) сидят по три под каждой
   прицветной чешуйкой; в каждой завязи по две висячих семяпочки, из которых
   по опылении одна засыхает, а вторая разрастается, занимая всю полость
   завязи. Женская оплодотворённая серёжка в это время удлиняется, нередко у
   неё вырастает ножка, а самая она утолщается вследствие увеличения объёма
   чешуек, превращаясь постепенно в овальную или продолговато-цилиндрическую
   «шишку». После созревания плодов, которое происходит довольно скоро — в
   зависимости от климата, в июле — сентябре — плодовая серёжка (шишка)
   осыпается и от неё остаётся лишь стержень. Формула цветка: [IMG] \ast
   P_{2}\;A_{2}\;G_{0} и [IMG] \ast P_{0}\;A_{0}\;G_{{(\underline 2)}}^[10].

   Плод — сплюснутый чечевицеобразный орешек, несущий на вершине два засохших
   столбика и окружённый более или менее широким тонкокожим перепончатым
   крылышком. Плоды сидят по три в пазухах трёхлопастных плодовых
   (прицветных) чешуек. Семена очень лёгкие — в одном грамме насчитывается
   5000 семян. Легко разносятся ветром (на расстояние до 100 м от
   материнского растения^[8]), плоды не вскрываются.

Распространение и экологическое состояние[править | править код]

   [IMG]Берёза карликовая на переднем плане. На заднем плане Берёза
   европейская белая

   Многие виды берёзы — широко распространённые и важнейшие лесообразующие
   породы, в значительной мере определяющие облик и видовой состав лиственных
   и хвойно-лиственных (смешанных) лесов в умеренной и холодной части Евразии
   и Северной Америки. Есть среди берёз и кустарники, самая известная из них
   Берёза карликовая (Betula nana) обычна в тундрах Европы и Северной
   Америки^[11] и горных тундрах Сибири. Она не достигает и 1 м в высоту. В
   ледниковый и послеледниковый периоды эта берёза была распространена
   гораздо дальше на юг, сейчас она встречается там лишь на болотах как
   реликт^[источник не указан 575 дней].

   Большинство берёз очень морозостойки, не страдают от весенних заморозков,
   переносят вечную мерзлоту, проникают далеко за Полярный круг или образуют
   верхнюю границу леса в горах (например, берёзовое криволесье на Кавказе).
   Более требовательны к теплу берёзы субтропических районов
   (гималайско-китайские, некоторые японские и американская Берёза речная
   (Betula nigra))^[12]. Самый южный и теплолюбивый вид берёзы на нашей
   планете — Берёза ольховидная (Betula alnoides), заходящая в горные районы
   муссонных тропиков Юго-Восточной Азии^[13]^[14].

   [IMG]Берёза карликовая, стелющаяся по камням. Гренландия

   К богатству почвы берёза не требовательна. Виды берёзы растут на песчаных
   и суглинистых, богатых и бедных, влажных и сухих почвах. Она встречается
   на сырых берегах рек и морей, на болотах, в болотистых тундрах, на сухих
   каменистых склонах, в знойных сухих степях. Так, например, Берёза Радде
   (Betula raddeana) образует леса, покрывающие ущелья в горно-лесном поясе в
   горах Дагестана^[12].

   Большинство берёз светолюбивы, хотя есть и довольно теневыносливые (Берёза
   ребристая (Betula costata), Берёза шерстистая (Betula lanata) и Берёза
   аллеганская (Betula alleghaniensis))^[12].

   Многие виды берёзы — пионеры заселения вырубок, гарей, пустошей и
   обнажений (такова Берёза повислая (Betula pendula)): в этих местах нередко
   наблюдаются чистые берёзовые насаждения (вторичные леса) в основном
   травяного типа, поэтому нередко берёзу относят к почвоулучшающим
   породам^[8]. В дальнейшем состав древостоя меняется: берёза вытесняется
   елью, так как еловая поросль может существовать под относительно светлым
   берёзовым пологом, а молодые берёзы затеняются елями и гибнут (см.
   Сукцессия)^[12].

   В лесостепи на увлажнённых местах в блюдцеобразных понижениях берёза
   (зачастую вместе с осиной и изредка с ивой) образует небольшие леса,
   называемые колка́ми. Колки́ характерны для лесостепи Западной Сибири,
   встречаются на Окско-Донской равнине^[15]. В то же время в Фенноскандии и
   на Русском Севере березняки являются монопородными, без малейшей примеси
   деревьев других пород; в отличие от смешанных лесов более южных
   широт^[16].

   [IMG]Берёзовый лес в районе Инари (финская заполярная Лапландия)

   Род Берёза в коллекциях ботанических садов России в целом представлен 92
   таксонами, исключительно в коллекциях открытого грунта. Крупнейшая
   коллекция рода находится в Главном ботаническом саду Российской Академии
   наук^[17].

   Продолжительность жизни берёзы, по разным данным, — 100—120 лет^[18], 150
   (300) лет^[19], 100—150 лет, отдельные деревья доживают до 400 лет и
   более^[12].

   На берёзе живут, помимо прочих, гусеница бражника липового, пяденица
   берёзовая, малинница обыкновенная^[источник не указан 575 дней].
   Жук-олень — самый крупный жук Европы^[источник не указан 575 дней] —
   обитает в древесине берёзы и других лиственных деревьев. Листьями берёзы
   питаются майские жуки, и в отдельные годы, когда их численность особенно
   высока, они способны причинить серьёзный вред деревьям^[12].

   Для берёзовых рощ и смешанных с берёзой лесов характерны
   микоризообразующие виды грибов, многие из которых живут в сообществе
   исключительно или преимущественно с берёзой. Наиболее обычны и известны из
   них^[20]:

   [IMG]Волнушка розовая среди сухих берёзовых листьев. Литва
     * подберёзовик обыкновенный и некоторые другие виды рода Обабок —
       подберёзовик болотный, подберёзовик розовеющий;
     * белый гриб берёзовый — относится к наиболее ценным съедобным грибам;
     * некоторые млечники (груздь чёрный, волнушка розовая), определённые
       виды сыроежек — сыроежка зелёная, сыроежка жёлтая, сыроежка пищевая.

   Повреждённые деревья могут поражаться паразитическими грибами — например,
   трутовиком скошенным (Inonotus obliquus), редко встречающимся на других
   деревьях. Препараты, получаемые из чаги — бесплодной формы трутовика
   скошенного, — применяются в народной и официальной медицине в качестве
   адаптогенов^[источник не указан 575 дней].

   Для берёзы характерны и специфические виды грибов — разрушителей отмершей
   древесины (сапротрофных), которые играют важнейшую роль в процессе
   самоочистки лесов от сухостоя, буреломов и т. п.^[21] Из них в берёзовых
   рощах обычны трутовик берёзовый (Piptoporus betulinus) и лензитес
   берёзовый (Lenzites betulina), первый из которых не встречается на
   древесине других пород, а второй обычно предпочитает берёзу^[22].

Химический состав[править | править код]

   В коре большинства видов содержится тритерпеноид бетулин, один из немногих
   белых органических пигментов. В коре берёзы ребристой (Betula costata) его
   содержание превышает 5 %, у берёзы повислой (Betula pendula) содержание
   бетулина доходит до 14 %, а в коре берёзы маньчжурской (Betula
   mandshurica) — до 27 %. Из видов, растущих в России, максимальное
   содержание бетулина наблюдается в коре берёзы пушистой (Betula
   pubescens) — до 44 %^[23].

   В почках берёзы повислой (равно как и пушистой) содержится примерно 3—5 %
   эфирного масла, основными компонентами которого являются бициклические
   сесквитерпеноиды. Почки содержат также смолистые вещества, алкалоиды,
   аскорбиновую кислоту, флавоноиды и высшие жирные кислоты^[24].

   В листьях содержатся эфирное масло, производные даммарана, кумарины,
   дубильные вещества и флавоноиды^[24].

     * В пчеловодстве берёза важна как пыльценос^[26].
     * Берёзовая лучина применялась в старину для освещения крестьянских
       изб — она горит ярко и почти без копоти.
     * Берёзовые веники заготавливаются как корм для домашнего скота на
       зимний период, также они используются в качестве банных.

  Древесина[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Берёза (древесина)
   [IMG]
   Берёзовый шпон

   Берёзу рубят в возрасте спелости древесины, — от 40—50 лет. Раньше для
   получения крупного хорошего поделочного материала берёза срубалась в 60—80
   и даже иногда в 100-летнем возрасте^[12]; на дрова она пригодна в 40—60
   лет. На постройки берёза мало годится, так как скоро загнивает из-за
   развития грибка^[25].

   Тяжёлая плотная берёзовая древесина довольно прочная, хорошо
   сопротивляется раскалыванию. Цвет — белый, с более жёлтым ядром.
   Используется для изготовления высококачественной фанеры, лыж, мелких
   резных игрушек, прикладов огнестрельного оружия. Особенно ценится
   карельская берёза, которая отличается очень сложной фактурой
   древесины^[12].

   Наросты, изредка образующиеся на корнях, крупных сучьях или стволах
   берёз, — кап — на разрезе имеют своеобразный сложный и красивый рисунок.
   Обработанный кап издавна использовали для изготовления изящных поделок:
   шкатулок, табакерок, портсигаров, декоративных деталей мебели^[27].

  Дёготь[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Дёготь

   При сухой перегонке берёсты образуется берёзовый, или берёстовый,
   дёготь^[28].

   Берёзовый дёготь применяется в медицине и ветеринарии, преимущественно как
   противовоспалительное и антисептическое средство, входит в состав
   дегтярного мыла и разнообразных мазей и кремов, применяемых для лечения
   кожных заболеваний. В кожевенном производстве применяется при выделки
   юфти^[28].

   В старину им смазывали ступицы тележных колёс для уменьшения
   трения^[источник не указан 575 дней].

  Береста[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Берёста
   [IMG]Две стороны куска берёсты

   Верхний слой коры берёзы имеет собственное название — берёста, или
   береста́ (допустимы оба варианта написания и произношения^[29]). Благодаря
   присутствию смолистых веществ берёста отличается чрезвычайной прочностью и
   долговечностью^[30]. Берёста издавна применялась в промыслах народов
   Северной и Восточной Европы для изготовления таких предметов быта, как
   туесков, корзин, коробок, ковшей, лукошек и другой кухонной утвари, а
   также простейшей обуви (лапти)^[источник не указан 575 дней]. Народы
   Крайнего Севера и Дальнего Востока, а также многие североамериканские
   индейцы использовали берёсту для изготовления лодок и сооружения жилищ —
   чумов, вигвамов и т.д.

   Береста использовалась и в качестве материала для письма. Берёста
   прекрасно сохраняется в речных наносах, торфяниках, благодаря чему в
   1951 году экспедицией А. В. Арциховского были обнаружены первые берестяные
   грамоты — в Новгороде, где ко второму кварталу 2016 года их раскопали
   1079. Кроме того, они были найдены во многих других российских городах, в
   том числе на территории Москвы^[31], а также на Украине и в Беларуси.
   Помимо текстов на древнерусском языке, среди обнаруженных грамот есть и
   пять на неславянских языках (например, грамота № 292, содержащая
   карелоязычный заговор против молнии). Известно также множество древних
   китайских и санскритских текстов на берёсте^[12].

   В прежние времена берёсту употребляли в качестве средства от малярии^[32].

  Берёзовый сок[править | править код]

   [IMG]Заготовка берёзового сока, ГДР, апрель 1985 г.
   Основная статья: Берёзовый сок

   Берёзы к концу вегетативного периода накапливают питательные вещества, в
   том числе сахара́. Весной, с началом сокодвижения (до распускания
   листьев), эти вещества начинают подниматься к листьям^[источник не указан
   575 дней].

   Если на стволе сделать в это время надрезы, из них будет вытекать
   значительное количество сока (пасоки — жидкости, выделяющейся из
   перерезанных сосудов древесины стеблей или корней живых растений под
   влиянием корневого давления), содержащего от 0,43 до 1,13 % сахара^[26].
   Явление вытекания наблюдается вслед за первыми оттепелями; в первые дни
   вытекание незначительно, но затем постепенно возрастает и, достигнув через
   некоторое время максимума, начинает постепенно убывать, а ко времени
   распускания почек совершенно прекращается. Длительность вытекания сока —
   несколько недель^[33].

   Сбор берёзового сока истощает дерево, к тому же через раны на коре в живые
   ткани могут проникнуть болезнетворные микроорганизмы, дерево может
   заболеть и в конце концов погибнуть. В связи с этим после сбора сока
   рекомендуется повреждения на коре замазывать варом или глиной^[34].

   Берёзовый сок идёт на приготовление разных напитков. Крупная берёза может
   дать в сутки больше одного ведра сока. Сок иногда консервируют, подкисляя
   фосфорной кислотой. Упаренный берёзовый сок применяют для весенней
   подкормки пчёл^[26].

  Медицинское применение[править | править код]

   Берёзу традиционно использовали в лечебных целях: настои из берёзовых
   почек и листьев — как мочегонное, бактерицидное, ранозаживляющее и
   жаропонижающее средство^[30], а масляную вытяжку из берёзовых почек — как
   дерматологическое средство.

   Из эфирного масла берёзы вишнёвой (Betula lenta) (путём перегонки коры и
   побегов с водяным паром) получают метилсалицилат^[24].

   Берёзовый дёготь — традиционное консервирующее и дезинфицирующее
   средство^[30].

   Берёзовые веники в России традиционно использовали в лечебных и
   профилактических целях в русской бане^[30].

   Считалось, что запах берёзы будто бы излечивает от меланхолии и помогает
   от сглаза, а берёзовый сок, собранный в особые дни марта и апреля, очищает
   кровь^[35].

   В северных широтах берёзовая пыльца иногда является аллергеном,
   ответственным за проявление сезонной сенной лихорадки у людей с повышенной
   чувствительностью^[36].

  Кормовое значение[править | править код]

   Берёза карликовая (Betula nana L.), берёза пушистая (Betula pubescens
   Ehrh.), берёза повислая (Betula pendula Roth) играют важную роль в питании
   европейского лося (Alces alces). Наиболее охотно поедается молодая листва
   ранней весной. В Ленинградской области в мае порода составляет 31,4 % всех
   поедей, а в течение лета 15,3—19,8 %. Питательность зимних побегов
   чрезвычайно низка и сравнительно с другими породами резко падает по мере
   увеличения их диаметра. В первой половине зимы лоси почти не поедают
   берёзу, а систематически едят только при недостатке других более ценных
   кормов, обычно в феврале — апреле^[37].

  Виды рода Берёза[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Виды рода Берёза

   Представители рода отличаются высоким полиморфизмом, по современной
   классификации выделяется 89 подтвержденных видов, наиболее известные из
   них:

     * Берёза вишнёвая (Betula lenta). Вид из Северной Америки с блестящей
       красновато-коричневой или почти чёрной корой.
     * Берёза карликовая (Betula nana). Кустарник высотой обычно не более 1 м
       с мелкими округлыми листьями; растёт в Европе на болотах, в
       заболоченных сосняках.
     * Берёза низкая, или Берёза приземистая (Betula humilis). Кустарник
       высотой до 2 м с эллиптическими листьями; растёт в Европе по берегам
       водоёмов, на болотах.
     * Берёза повислая, или Берёза бородавчатая, или Берёза повисшая, или
       Берёза поникающая (Betula pendula). Вид, широко распространённый в
       Европе и Сибири; встречается также в северной Африке. Кора от
       снежно-белой до серовато-белой. Высота обычно 10—15 м, иногда до 30 м.
       Молодые побеги голые, бородавчатые (в отличие от берёзы опушённой, у
       которой молодые побеги опушённые и без бородавок).
     * Берёза полезная (Betula utilis). Вид из Гималаев высотой до 18 м со
       светлой гладкой корой.
     * Берёза пушистая, или Берёза опушённая (Betula pubescens). В
       Европейской части России нередко растёт рядом с берёзой бородавчатой.
       О том, как отличить эти виды, см. выше. Является номенклатурным типом.
     * Берёза чёрная (Betula nigra). Вид из восточной части Северной Америки.
       У молодых деревьев кора белая и гладкая, у более старых — тёмная,
       морщинистая. Предположительно, предковый вид^[40]
     * Берёза Эрмана, или Берёза каменная (Betula ermanii). Встречается на
       Камчатке, Сахалине, по берегам Охотского моря. Названа каменной за на
       редкость твёрдую, плотную и тяжёлую древесину, которая тонет в воде.

Культивирование[править | править код]

  Агротехника[править | править код]

   В России лучший рост берёзовых насаждений замечается в северных и средних
   областях, на умеренно влажных, не слишком плотных почвах, не бедных
   содержанием перегноя. Различие в минеральном составе почв не обнаруживает
   особенно заметного влияния на рост берёзы, и только на известковых почвах
   она растёт весьма редко. Нуждаясь, как светолюбивая древесная порода, в
   достаточном солнечном освещении, она рано изреживается в чистых
   насаждениях, что влияет неблагоприятным образом на плодородие почвы.
   Произрастая же в смеси с хвойными породами и отличаясь быстрым ростом,
   берёза скоро обгоняет их в высоту и обнаруживает вредное влияние на их
   дальнейшее произрастание: её длинные и тонкие ветви, приводимые в движение
   ветром, сбивают, «охлёстывают» почки у хвойных, вследствие чего деревья
   этих пород становятся уродливыми. После срубки берёза успешно
   возобновляется как семенами, ежегодно производимыми в изобилии, так и
   порослью от пня, появляющейся возле шейки корня даже у старых 60—70-летних
   деревьев^[41].

   При выращивании берёз в декоративных целях следует учесть, что соседство с
   ними действует на многие растения угнетающе. Происходит это по следующим
   причинам:

     * берёзы обычно отличаются более быстрым ростом по сравнению с другими
       деревьями;
     * берёзы иссушают почву;
     * при разложении опавшей берёзовой листвы выделяются вещества, которые
       являются для некоторых растений ингибиторами роста.

   С берёзами в культуре хорошо уживаются молодые ели, а также многие виды
   шиповника^[42].

       отслаиваясь, закручивается;
     * Betula pendula 'Purpurea' — отличается пурпурными листьями;
     * Betula pendula 'Laciniata' (другое название —  'Dalecarlica') —

Проблема массового засыхания берёз[править | править код]

   [IMG]Берёзовый лес, поражённый болезнью, Липецкая область

   Средняя продолжительность жизни берёз составляет около 100—200 лет, однако
   этот возраст считается предельным. На практике возраст деревьев колеблется
   от 60 до 100. После 60 лет зачастую наблюдается высокая болезненность
   деревьев, при которой берёзовые рощи массово засыхают начиная с верхушек и
   затем полностью. В период сильных ветров деревья ломаются и образуют
   завалы. Причиной в том числе служит бактериальная водянка, болезнь
   вызываемая бактерией Erwinia multivora^[44] Больше всего уязвимы деревья
   старше 40 лет. Часто проблема встречается в Европейской части России и в
   Сибири. О неожиданном и резком усыхании целых лесов сообщают в разных
   регионах в том числе местные новости, лесничества при этом стараются
   начать санитарные рубки больных деревьев.^[45].

  Берёза в мифологии[править | править код]

   Дохристианская символика, связанная с берёзой, известна у многих народов,
   проживавших в регионах распространения этого растения; это относится и к
   кельтам, и к древним скандинавам, и к славянам. Для всех этих народов
   берёза являлась в первую очередь символом перехода от весны к лету и, в
   более широком смысле, символом смерти и воскрешения^[35].

    Финно-угры, германцы[править | править код]

   [IMG]Берёза — кереметь (объект поклонения) в чувашской деревне

   Начиная со времён родового строя берёза — культовое дерево и национальный
   символ у большинства финно-угров — карел, вепсов, манси, хантов, пермяков,
   коми-зырян и финнов (сумь, емь), а также весьма почитаемое национальное
   дерево у скандинавов — шведов и норвежцев^[46]. Не последнюю очередь в
   культовом статусе данного дерева играет и его распространение в
   Фенноскандии: берёза является самым северным деревом региона, и её ареал
   простирается даже таёжных лесов, доходя за 71° с. ш. Также на почитание
   берёзы могли повлиять её броский внешний вид и устойчивость к сильным
   нагрузкам, вроде нагрянувшей бури. Не исключено, что берёза могла быть
   почитаемым деревом у жителей этого региона ещё в каменном веке, поскольку
   берёза стала первой породой деревьев, проникшей на Север после окончания
   оледенения (лишь после неё, да и то, значительно позднее, там появилась
   сосна)^[47] По-видимому, почитание берёзы скандинавскими германцами было
   позаимствовано у финно-угорских народов^[48]. У скандинавов берёза была
   символом богини Нерты, которая считалась великой Матерью-Землёй.^[источник

   У германских народов из берёзы изготовляется так называемый «майский шест»
   (англ. maypole, нем. Maibaum), обильно украшаемый на майские праздники
   (Троицу, первомай) и являющийся одним из их главных компонентов^[49] — он
   является центром сбора молодёжи и различных увеселений под открытым небом.
   Майский шест обладает перекладиной наверху, обильно украшаемой, в
   частности, обвиваемой молодыми берёзовыми ветвями и первыми полевыми
   цветами^[48]. Также в качестве майского дерева может выступать живая
   берёзка. В северной и средней Швеции праздники в промежутке 22 апреля-1
   мая называются «днями берёзы», поэтому не исключено, что данный обычай
   является пережитком древних праздников, устраивавшихся у берёзы, как
   священного дерева^[48].

   В представлениях многих финно-угорских народов (в частности, у мордвы)
   берёза ассоциировалась с Мировым древом^[50].

   По карело-финским представлениям, берёза являлась одним из культовых
   деревьев хийси — лесных духов (наряду с сосной и т.д.)^[51]. Среди карел
   Финляндии на Юханнус было принято ставить во дворе или заносить в избу
   либо берёзовую ветвь, либо небольшую берёзку^[52]. Время от Юханнуса до
   Петрова дня среди финнов и карел считалось наиболее благоприятным от
   избавления от насекомых. Так, по поверью, записанному в посёлке Войница
   Калевальского района Карелии, разбросанные по избе в Иванов день берёзовые
   листья избавляют от кровососущих^[53]. В селе Пертозеро Ругозерской
   волости было известно следующее гадание: вечером Петрова дня девушки с
   приговором собирали мелкие берёзовые и осиновые листья, после чего
   заворачивали их в платок, которым вытирали пот с лица и клали его под
   подушку, после чего девушке приснится её суженый. Также платок с листьями
   можно было незаметно подсунуть в карман того, кого любила девушка^[54].
   При посещении кладбищ могилы «опахивали», то есть, подметали, берёзовыми
   вениками^[55]. Также карелы верили, что парка девушек в сауне берёзовыми
   вениками повышает их т.н. лемпи/лемби — сексуальную энергию и
   привлекательность^[56].

   По представлениям нижегородских марийцев, как сообщает исследователь их
   культуры и мифологии, Николай Морохин, берёза является «женской» породой
   дерева (наряду с липой), в то время как мужской был дуб. Во многих местах
   у домов стояли почитаемые берёзы^[57].

   [IMG]Стефан Пермский срубает прокудливую берёзу

   «Житие Стефана Пермского» сообщает, что близ села Усть-Вымь находилась
   т.н. «прокудливая (т.е. проклятая) берёза», которой поклонялись местные
   жители — зыряне и пермяки. Святитель Стефан Пермский в ходе своей
   просветительской и проповеднической миссии среди язычников в 1379 году
   срубил и сжёг эту берёзу, при этом когда Стефан рубил её, она будто бы
   издавала стоны, а ствол истекал кровью. Впоследствии, как сообщает
   предание, на этом месте была построена первая в крае церковь, а её престол
   расположился непосредственно на пне срубленной берёзы^[58]^[59].

   У удмуртов среди священных предметов каждого рода, хранившихся в
   специальном культовом коробе воршуда (покровителя рода), была и берёзовая
   ветвь^[60]. Это отражение бытовавшего у них мифа о боге Кылдысине, некогда
   жившем среди людей, но потом улетевшем на небо. После того, как люди стали
   отчаянно просить Кылдысина вернуться в каком угодно обличье, тот появился
   на вершине берёзы в облике белки^[61]. Таким образом, берёза считалась
   священным деревом этого бога, под которым ему возносились мольбы^[62]. На
   берёзе также, по представлениям удмуртов, обитали души новорождённых
   (покровительницей которых была богиня земли Калтащ-эква)^[60].

   У поволжских финно-угров существовало такое понятие, как «керемет(ь)»,
   обозначавшее священную рощу, состоявшую из сакральных деревьев, в число
   которых входила и берёза^[63].

   По представлениям мордовских народов, под Мировым древом (которым могла
   быть и берёза), верховный бог Нишке собирает целый пантеон богов, иногда
   насчитывающий семь^[64]. Там же гигантская птица высадила три яйца, из
   которых вылупились три «авы», духи-матери: Норов-ава, мать полей;
   Вирь-ава, мать леса; и Варма-ава, мать ветра^[65]. У эрзян дереву посвящён
   обрядовый праздник «Тудоннь ильтямонь чи» (с эрз. — «Праздник
   берёзы»)^[источник не указан 575 дней].

   Отличительной чертой погребального ритуала финно-пермян, согласно
   археологическим данным, является обёртывание умершего в берёсту. Северные
   русские и старообрядцы укладывают покойника в гроб (домовину) на берёзовые
   веники без комля^[источник не указан 575 дней].

   Согласно древним представлениям манси и хантов^[источник не указан 575
   дней], Священная берёза-праматерь, принадлежавшая Калтащ-экве, богине
   земли, была златолистой и росла семью серебряными стволами из одного
   основания^[48]. Сама Калтащ-эква, согласно мифам и песням, обитала в
   подножии семи берёз, Мирового древа^[66]. Фетишем Нуми-Торума, небесного
   бога, служила берёза^[67], позади его жилища росла берёза с золотыми
   ветвями, на которых сидело семь кукушек — олицетворений человеческих душ.
   Также берёза была священным деревом Калтащ-эквы и Мось — прародительницы
   одноимённой фратрии^[68].

   В фольклоре балтийских и германских народов сохранились устойчивые
   употребления, при которых слово берёза выступает в значении чистоты,
   невинности^[69].

    Индоиранские народы[править | править код]

   У осетин берёза считалась одним из почитаемых деревьев. В нартском эпосе
   (известном у практически всех народов западного и центрального Кавказа,
   включая осетин) берёзы были в числе деревьев, откликнувшиеся на зов
   умирающего богатыря-нарта Сослана, за что он благословил берёзу и пожелал
   навеки быть лучшим из деревьев. Из берёзы, как чистого и почитаемого
   дерева, изготавливались вертелы, оглобли, ярма, деревянные детали мельницы
   и т.д. Осетины верили, что в хлеву, где находился волшебный берёзовый
   прутик, находившееся там стадо не уменьшалось, сколько бы его оттуда не
   убывало^[70].

    Кельты[править | править код]

   Кельты хоронили умерших в шапках из берёзовой коры^[35].

    Славяне[править | править код]

   [IMG]«Семик», лубок XIX в.

   В представлениях славян отношение к берёзе было двойственным: согласно
   одним традициям, дерево и изделия из него, в том числе из берёсты,
   считались оберегом от нечистой силы; в частности, берёзовые веники,
   использовавшиеся в бане, рассматривались и как инструменты ритуального
   очищения^[35]. С другой же стороны, берёза считалась нечистым деревом, в
   ветвях которого поселяются черти и русалки, и которое является воплощением
   душ умерших родственников; берёза также считалась деревом, из которого
   нечистая сила делает свои инструменты — к примеру, ведьмы, согласно
   поверьям, летают на берёзовых мётлах^[35].

   В представлениях русских берёза представало как дерево, приносящее добро и
   оберегающее от нечисти и болезней. Именно поэтому она издавна являлась
   почитаемым деревом. Кроме того, берёза символизировало женское начало, и
   покровительствовала девушкам и молодым женщинам. Также в русских поверьях
   присутствовала связь берёзы с душами предков^[71].

   В русской крестьянской поэзии очень распространён образ берёзы,
   ассоциируемый с образом выходящей замуж невесты (парным персонажем,
   женихом, является дуб). Как персонаж (порой антропоморфный), берёза
   фигурирует и в русских народных сказках. Так, в сказке «Дурак и берёза»
   главный герой пытается продать быка своих братьев берёзе (дураку кажется,
   что шелестящая листьями на ветру берёза будто бы разговаривает с ним), но,
   после безуспешного торга о цене, привязывает быка к ней и откладывает
   сделку на завтра. На следующий день, когда быка съели волки, дурак
   безуспешно пытается выбить долг у берёзы, и в конце концов, на третий день
   рубит её, находя в дупле котёл с золотом. Также берёза является одним из
   немаловажных персонажей в сказке «Берёза и три сокола».

   В украинском и чешском языках именем берёзы назван месяц март (укр.
   березень, чеш. březen). В Древней Руси названием «березозол» (др.-рус.
   брѣзозолъ, березозолъ) обозначался апрель. Названия марта и апреля,
   связанные с берёзой, указывают на время появления листвы на берёзе (от
   праслав. *berzozolъ, где элемент праслав. *-zolъ связан с понятием
   «зеленеть, зелёный»)^[72]^[73]^[74].

   См. также: Семик

   Берёза имеет ключевое значение в Семи́ке — восточнославянском празднике,
   отмечающимся в четверг на седьмой неделе после Пасхи и за три дня до
   Троицы (Троицына дня)^[75], а также существенную роль на сам Троицын
   день^[71]. Поскольку эти дни связаны с поминанием умерших, то и берёза,
   как растение, также связанное с предками, занимала отнюдь не последнее
   место^[76]. Так как, как уже было указано выше, берёза в представлениях
   русских является «женским» деревом, то и Семик считался сугубо женским
   праздником^[77]. Из справляемых во время Семика обрядов был и обряд
   завивания берёзы, найденные плакучие ветви берёзы заплетались в венки,
   косы, прикреплялись к земле и там закреплять колышками, связывались между
   собой ленточками, и так далее^[78]. Когда-то важность обряда была столь
   высока, что с участием/неучастием в нём связывалась жизнь или смерть
   матери^[79]. Другим из обрядов было т.н. «кумление», в ходе которого
   девушки устанавливали дружеские отношения на определённый срок. Кумились
   все присутствовавшие, что объединяло их в своего рода союз^[77]^[80].
   Одним из наиболее распространённых способов кумления был следующий: две
   девушки, близкие подруги подходили с двух сторон к завитому на берёзе
   венку, троекратно целовались, говорили «покумимся кума, покумимся, чтобы
   нам с тобой не браниться, вечно дружиться», после чего обменивались
   нательными крестиками и небольшими подарками^[80]. После этого вокруг
   берёзы начинали водить хоровод, после него устраивали пиршество с блюдами,
   чьими основными блюдами были яйца и яичница, лепёшки, пироги,
   пиво^[77]^[78]. В песнях, исполнявшихся во время праздника, берёза
   антропоморфизировалась, наделялась женскими чертами, она призывала
   девушек-участниц идти в поле и вить венки или же сама обещала загнуться и
   завиться в веночки^[81]. Во время празднования обеих праздников дома и
   храмы (как и изнутри, так и снаружи) украшались берёзовыми ветвями или
   срубленными берёзками. Данный обычай, проводимый на Троицу, имел (и до сих
   пор имеет) место как и православных славян, так и католиков^[30]^[71],
   также берёзовые веники подносили к культовым сооружениям и карелы^[82].
   Обряды, связанные с берёзами, заканчивались в Духов день, приходящийся на
   понедельник, следующий за Троицей^[80]. Впрочем, на территории
   современного Киришского района Ленобласти на Ивана Купалу засохшие к тому
   моменту троицкие берёзки собирали молодёжь и молодые семейные пары, вешали
   на специально выбранную ель и сжигали^[83].

    Тюркские народы[править | править код]

   Считается, что Умай (Умайя) — тюркская богиня, олицетворяющая земное
   естество — спустилась на землю с двумя берёзами^[35].

   У чувашей, тюркского народа, исторически проживающего по соседству с
   поволжскими финно-уграми, также существует понятие креметей, в число
   которых входит и берёза.

   По представлениям якутов, у каждого рода есть своё священное дерево, ал
   лук мас (якут. аал луук мас), в котором обитает дух-покровительница этого
   места. В числе тотемных деревьев могли быть и старые, могучие берёзы^[84].

  Русские пословицы, поговорки, загадки и шутки о берёзе[править | править код]

     * Стоит дерево, цветом зелено. В этом дереве — четыре угодья: первое —
       больным на здоровье, второе — людям колодец, третье — от зимы свет,
       четвёртое — дряхлым пеленанье.
     * Берёза не угроза: где стоит, там и шумит (Яросл. губ.)^[85].
     * Бела береста — да дёготь чёрен^[85].
     * Тонка берёза, да разуму учит^[85].

  Идиоматика[править | править код]

   Русское устойчивое выражение «дать/всыпать/задать берёзовой каши»
   («накормить/угостить берёзовой кашей», или просто «берёзовая каша»)
   означает «выпороть розгами». Схожие выражения с аналогичным смыслом
   встречаются и в других славянских языках (укр. дати/всипати березової
   каши, белор. даць/даваць бярозавай кашы, диал. чеш. dač březové
   kaše)^[86]. Аналогичное значение и у английского глагола «to birch;
   birching». Происхождение русской идиомы и английского слова (для которого
   это значение является основным) связано с тем, что часто розги изготовляли
   из берёзовых прутьев^[86].

  В геральдике[править | править код]

   Берёза в геральдике является естественной фигурой и распространённым
   геральдическим символом. Чаще всего берёза присутствует геральдике
   немецкоязычных стран и отчасти в чешской, реже — в российской. В
   германской геральдике берёза присутствует издревле — в гербах XII века
   берёза в основном изображалась в виде кустообразного дерево с золотой
   листвой и стволом либо серебряным, либо тоже золотым. В более поздних
   геральдических примерах (не только в немецкоязычных странах, но и Швеции)
   берёза имеет более достоверный вид — зеленое кустообразное дерево с белым
   (серебряным) стволом, независимо от цвета поля щита. На чешских гербах
   практически не встречается изображение целого берёзового дерева, как
   правило, изображается берёзовый лист треугольной формы и зелёного цвета,
   притом естественной формы, а не стилизованный^[48]. В российской
   геральдике у берёзы нет чёткого эмблематического вида, она изображается в
   виде дерева с кудреватой кроной зелёного цвета и с неясно очерченным
   чёрно-серым стволом^[87].

       одной из логотипов немецких экозащитников и партии зелёных^[87].

   Берёза из-за её особого места в русской традиционной культуре считается
   одним из символов России, поэтому во многих случаях её название
   использовалось для обозначения объектов, связанных с Россией (несмотря на
   то, что на сегодняшний день берёза так и не признана официальным
   национальным деревом России, равно как и любое другое дерево):

     * «Берёза» — одно из первых стихотворений Сергея Есенина (1913 г.,
       опубликовано в журнале «Мирок» в 1914 г.)^[88].
     * «Берёзка» — сеть валютных магазинов, существовавших в РСФСР с 1964 по
       1991 гг.
     * «Берёзка» — двухцветный камуфляж, практиковавшийся в СССР, а затем — в
       России^[89].
     * С берёзы начался Невский проспект в Санкт-Петербурге. На месте
       Адмиралтейского сада было посажено четыре ряда берёз, и это положило
       начало магистрали.
     * «Берёзка», государственный академический хореографический ансамбль,
       получивший название от первой постановки его основательницы и первой
       руководительницы, Надежды Надеждиной хоровода «Берёзка» (1948 г.),
       положенного на песню «Во поле берёзка стояла».
     * «Берёзовое» — одно из драгоценных пасхальных яиц Фаберже,
       изготовленное в 1917 году из карельской берёзы.
     * В императорской России было построено несколько «берёзовых домиков» —
       парковых павильонов, обитых снаружи берёзовыми жердями или тонкими
       брёвнами с неснятой корой: в Гатчине, в Кузьминках, в Петергофе.
       Такого рода павильоны-сюрпризы были типичны для российских парков
       второй половины XVIII века, за их намеренно скромным фасадом скрывался
       роскошный интерьер.

    В русской музыке[править | править код]

     * «Во поле берёза стояла» — русская народная хороводная песня, впервые
       опубликованная в 1790 г. в сборнике «Собрание народных русских песен с
       их голосами».
     * «Белая берёза» («Над тихоней речкой рос кудрявый клён…»; 1960 г.,) —
       песня Владимира Трепетцова. Звучала в некоторых фильмах, например, в
       «Москва слезам не верит» и «Афоня»)^[90].
     * «Берёзовый сок» — песня советской и белорусской фолк-рок-группы (ВИА)
       «Песняры»^[91].
     * «Русские берёзы» (слова Талгата Нигматулина, музыка Е. Ширяева) —
       песня, известная в исполнении Василия Зинкевича.
     * «Растёт в Волгограде берёзка» (музыка Григория Пономаренко, слова В.
       Агашина) — песня, известная в исполнении Людмилы Зыкиной.
     * «Берёзы» («Отчего так в России берёзы шумят…») — песня группы
       фолк-рок-группы Любэ, известная в исполнении Сергея Безрукова в
       телесериале «Участок» (2003 г.).

  В культуре других народов[править | править код]

     * Торама — деревянный духовой инструмент мордвы (эрзян и мокшан),
       изготавливаемый из ветви берёзы или клёна, которую продольно
       раскалывают пополам, сердцевину каждой половины выдалбливают, а затем
       половины обматывают берёстой. При обмотке берёстой одну сторону трубы
       делают шире, а другую у́же. Внутрь трубы вставляют язык из берёсты.
     * Цыгане оборачивали нательную рубашку вокруг берёзы и по первому звуку,
       услышанному после этого, предсказывали будущее^[35].
     * Берёза, в том числе карельская, чаще всего используется для
       изготовления рукояти традиционного скандинавского (в основном
       финского) ножа пуукко.
     * Алексей Ермолов в книге «Народная сельскохозяйственная мудрость в
       пословицах, поговорках и приметах» (издание 1905 года) приводит как
       интересное поверье у киргизов, а также у других азиатских народов,
       следующее выражение про берёзу: «Где меж елей вырастет берёза, туда
       непременно придут русские»^[85].
     * Берёза повислая — официальное дерево-национальный символ Финляндии,
       избранное на основе опросов, проведённых в 1988 году по инициативе
       Финской ассоциации по охране природы. В то же время у России до сих
       пор нет дерева с аналогичным статусом. Тем не менее, разновидность
       берёзы повислой, карельская, была официально объявлена официальным
       растением Республики Карелии по итогам конкурса «Аллея России»,
       прошедшего в 2014 году. Из претендентов на национальное карельское
       растение, помимо берёзы, были вереск обыкновенный, ель финская, сосна
       обыкновенная и страусник обыкновенный. За берёзу было отдано 65 %
       голосов от общего числа голосовавших^[92]. Символом Курганской области
       по итогам этого же конкурса, стала берёза Крылова, за которую было
       отдано 46 % голосов^[93]. Результаты голосования были объявлены на
       заседании оргкомитета конкурса, прошедшем в ноябре 2014 года в
       Минприроды России^[92].

  Топонимика[править | править код]

   От названия данного дерева образовано огромное количество топонимов в
   славяноязычных странах (включая Россию), а также в балтоязычных странах
   (например, от лит. beržas) и в Финляндии (от фин. koivu). В частности,
   довольно распространённым явлением является образование славянских
   гидронимов (прежде всего, названий рек) от названий деревьев, по
   подсчётам, на первом месте по частоте употребления в речных названиях
   находится берёза. Как правило, топоним (прежде всего ойконим) получал
   название из-за расположенного поблизости березняка^[94].

     * Название венгерского города Ньиредьхаза (венг. Nyíregyháza) образовано
       от области Ньиршег (венг. Nyírség), где он находится, и чьё название,
       в свою очередь, восходит к венг. nyir — берёза.
     * Название горного хребта Улан-Бургасы (Бурятия), означает «красный
       березняк».
     * Посёлок городского типа Берёзово (ХМАО) был основан на месте
       хантыйского поселения Хумгутваш/Халь-уш (соответственно с хант. и
       манс. берёзовый город)^[95]^[96].
     * Алтайское название села Удаловка (Республика Алтай) — алт. Ала-Кайыҥ,
       означает «разноцветная берёза»^[97].
     * От мордовского названия берёзы (эрз. и мокш. килей) происходит
       гидроним Келя (река, правый приток Пьяны) и ойконим Килелей (деревня
       Богородского района) в Нижегородской области^[94].
     * В честь дерева названо поселение Бёрчтаун в канадском графстве Шелберн
       (Новая Шотландия).

    Славянская топонимика[править | править код]

     * От названия деревья, в частности, образован гидроним Березина,
       название правого притока Днепра (Беларусь).
     * От названия деревья образованы следующие ойконимы:
          * В России — Берёза (микрорайон Самары), Березники (Пермский
            край)^[95], Белая Берёзка (Брянская область), Берёзов Майдан
            (Нижегородская область)^[94], Берёзовский, Березята
            (Нижегородская область, Марий Эл), Березополье (местность в
            Нижегородчине)^[94], Березник (Вологодская область, трудпосёлок
            для спецпереселенцев, раскулаченных крестьян, существовавший в
            1930-1947 гг.^[98]), Березовский^[98].
          * На Украине — Березнеговатое (укр. Березнегувате, Николаевская
            область), Березна (Черниговская область), Березанка,
            Березань^[95]^[99].
          * В Беларуси — Берёза (белор. Бяроза, Брестская
            область)^[95]^[100].
          * В восточнославянских странах в целом — Березовка (рус. , укр.
            Березівка, белор. Бярозаўка)^[94]^[98]^[99]^[100]^[101], Березино
            (рус. , укр. Березине, белор. Беразіно)^[94]^[99]^[100], Березно
            (рус. , укр. Березне), Березовец (рус. , укр.
            Березовець)^[94]^[99], Берёзки (рус. , укр. Березки, белор.
            Бярозкі)^[94], Берёзово (рус. , укр. Березово, белор.
            Бярозава)^[94]^[95]^[98], Берёзовый (рус. )^[94], Березовое (рус.
            )^[98].
          * В Чехии — Бржиза^[источник не указан 58 дней].

   Дуб (лат. Quércus) — род деревьев и кустарников семейства Буковые
   (Fagaceae).

   Род объединяет около 600 видов^[2]. Дуб хорошо узнаваем благодаря его
   плодам, желудям, являющимся, по сути, орехами.

Распространение[править | править код]

   Естественным ареалом дуба являются прежде всего регионы Северного
   полушария с умеренным, субтропическим и тропическим климатом. Южной
   границей распространения являются тропические высокогорья, по которым, в
   частности, несколько видов дуба пересекают экватор и незначительно заходят
   в Южное полушарие (Южная Америка и острова Индонезии).

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   [IMG]Дуб черешчатый. Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги О. В. Томе Flora
   von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, 1885

   Большинство дубов — крупные, плотные деревья. Многие виды этого рода
   принадлежат к числу так называемых вечнозелёных, то есть снабжены
   кожистыми листьями, остающимися на растении по нескольку лет. У других
   листья опадают ежегодно или, высыхая, остаются на дереве и разрушаются
   постепенно. Большинство вечнозеленых видов имеют цельные листья, другие —
   лопастные. Цветки однодомные: мужские и женские на одном и том же
   растении. Женские цветки образуют небольшие пучки или серёжки, мужские
   собраны висящими или стоячими, часто длинными серёжками. Цветочные покровы
   простые, слабо развитые, но при основании женских цветов образуется
   множество чешуевидных листочков, находящихся на кольчатом валике, который
   есть не что иное, как разросшееся цветоложе.
   Формула цветка: \ast P_{{(6-8)}}\;A_{{6-10}}\;G_{0} и \ast
   P_{{3+3}}\;A_{0}\;G_{{(\underline 3)}}^[3].

   При созревании плодов этот валик вместе со своими чешуями разрастается ещё
   больше и таким образом формируется характерное блюдце — плюска, которая
   облекает снизу дубовый плод, или жёлудь. У разных видов дуба величина
   желудей и форма чешуек крайне разнообразны: у одних чешуйки весьма малы, у
   других, как у дуба венгерского, длиной почти в сантиметр, отвёрнуты
   и т. д. Завязь цветков дуба почти всегда трёхгнёздая; но во время
   созревания плодов разрастается только одно гнездо и получается
   односемянный плод с крепким кожистым околоплодником, причисляемый к числу
   орехообразных плодов.

Наиболее известные виды[править | править код]

   См. также: Виды рода Дуб
   [IMG]Дуб каменный на равнине в Испании [IMG]Листья дуба болотного (Quercus
   palustris)

   Разные виды дуба распространены в умеренных и тёплых странах; в жарких
   странах — в горах. В Южной Америке, за исключением её северной
   оконечности, нет ни одного; нет их также в Австралии; в Африке только в
   странах при Средиземном море. В средней Европе их до 20 видов.

   В России значительно распространён только один вид — Дуб черешчатый
   (Quercus robur) с двумя разновидностями: различие между ними заключается в
   том, что одна цветёт в середине или в конце весны — это летний дуб, а
   другая — двумя или тремя неделями позже — это зимний дуб^[источник не
   указан 649 дней].

   Дуб доходит в северо-западной России до Финляндии, до 60° и даже 61°
   северной широты. В восточном направлении северный предел распространения
   дуба постепенно спускается к югу, и, подходя к Уральскому хребту,
   понижается до 57° и несколько южнее. Урал является восточной границей
   ареала дуба черешчатого.

   В западной России и на черноморском побережье Кавказа встречается весьма
   распространённый в остальной Европе вид — Дуб скальный (Quercus petraea).
   Оба эти дуба составляют главный состав русских дубовых лесов и рощ, число
   и обширность которых с каждым годом уменьшаются.

   В Приамурье и на Дальнем Востоке произрастает другой вид — Дуб монгольский
   (Quercus mongolica), реже там встречается Дуб зубчатый (Quercus dentata).
   Небольшая реликтовая роща дуба монгольского имеется в Забайкалье, недалеко
   от пограничной заставы Урюпино^[4].

   В 1950—1980-х годах предпринимались попытки акклиматизации дуба в
   Алтайском крае. Если посадки 1950-х годов проходили с переменным успехом,
   то насаждения 1980-х оказались успешными: дубы прижились и плодоносят,
   жёлуди разносятся птицами и бурундуками на значительные расстояния, где
   также приживаются^[5].

   Древесина дуба отличается прочностью, крепостью, плотностью, твёрдостью и
   тяжестью.

   Свойства древесины зависят от условий произрастания дерева. Так
   различается:

     * дуб боровой, дубровный или каменный (Quercus ilex), выросший на сухих
       песчаных местах — в дубравах или борах; кора у него толстая, почти
       чёрная; древесина мелкослойная, соломенно-жёлтого цвета, отличается
       твёрдостью, но малоупруга;
     * дуб ольсовый, свинцовый, железный или водяной, произраставший по
       берегам текучих вод и на возвышенных местах, среди ольховых трясин
       (ольс); он с кожистой корой светлого синевато-серого цвета, покрытой
       беловатыми пятнами, и прямым стволом с густой, редко сухой, вершиной;
       древесина крупнослойная с бледно-розовым отливом и белой оболонью,
       очень тяжёлая, весьма упругая, но при высыхании сильно трескающаяся;
     * на местах средних между бором и ольсом вырастает дуб с древесиной
       переходных качеств — желтоватой, с белой оболонью, более упругой, чем
       дубровного дуба, но ниже ольсового, и по твёрдости уступающей обоим;
       кора на стволе толстая, мягкая, серо-бурая, покрытая в трещинах
       красноватым налётом, а с северной стороны зеленоватым мхом;
       суховершинность и дупловатость комлевой части ствола довольно часты.

   Дубовая древесина — превосходный строительный и поделочный материал: она
   идёт на подводные и сухопутные постройки, устройство подводных и основных
   частей деревянных судов (преимущественно летнего дуба) и как бочарный,
   экипажный, машинный, мебельный, паркетный и столярный лес (предпочитается
   зимний дуб); особенно ценится для последних морёный дуб, долго пролежавший
   в воде (до сотни лет) и имеющий тёмную, почти чёрную древесину. Хорошо
   поддаётся искусственному старению (браширование).

   От бортов корабля USS Constitution, сделанных из виргинского дуба^[en],
   могли отскакивать даже выпущенные из пушек ядра^[6].

   Хотя теплота сгорания древесины дуба выше, чем у других древесных пород
   средней полосы России, но для полного сгорания дубовых дров требуется
   большая тяга воздуха, дубовый уголь плохо держит жар.

  Дубовая кора[править | править код]

   Дубовая кора содержит много дубильной кислоты, а потому идёт на дубление
   кож. Дубовые галлы, или чернильные орешки, то есть патологические
   образования на листьях (вызванные насекомыми из рода Cynips^[en], которые
   откладывают яйца в тело листа), также содержат дубильную кислоту и
   краситель, служащие для дубления, приготовления красок и чернил для
   письма. Такие орешки образуются и на дубе, произрастающем в средней полосе
   России, и на малоазиатском и греческом дубе — Quercus infectoria^[en] и
   пр. В тех же странах растёт Дуб австрийский (Quercus cerris), плодовые
   блюдца которого идут также на дубление и составляют предмет значительной
   торговли. У дуба пушистого (Quercus pubescens) из Восточного
   Средиземноморья и соседних областей Азии они служат для дубления кож,
   крашения тканей и производства чернил.

   Отвар дубовой коры мастера древесной пластики используют для получения
   эффекта чёрного дерева^[7]^:89.

   Кора дуба используется в качестве лекарственного средства ^[привести
   цитату? 1973 дня]. Дубильные вещества оказывают вяжущее и
   противовоспалительное действие, при диарее «закрепляя» кишечник. Настой,
   или отвар хорош в качестве полоскания при инфекциях полости рта и горла, а
   также при воспалении дёсен. Он «дубит» слизистую оболочку и лишает этим
   бактерий питательной среды. Позднее затвердевшая слизистая заменяется
   новой, здоровой тканью.

Значение и применение[править | править код]

   Дубовый строевой и поделочный лес дают главным образом названные
   русско-европейские виды. Из остальных видов дуба всего важнее Дуб
   пробковый (Quercus suber), растущий в южной Франции, Испании, Алжире, на
   Черноморском побережье Кавказа. Он замечателен необыкновенно толстым слоем
   пробки, образующимся в его коре. Слой этот бывает в несколько сантиметров
   толщиной и идёт на приготовление бутылочных пробок. Снятие этого
   пробкового слоя начинается с 10- или 15-летних деревьев. Первая пробка не
   годится, но через 8—12 лет нарастает новая, которая и идёт в дело. После
   второй съёмки снимается через известный промежуток времени третий слой
   и т. д.

   Вечнозелёный Дуб каменный (Quercus ilex), растущий в Италии и в
   средиземной области вообще, даёт сладкие жёлуди, употребляемые в пищу. Тем
   же отличаются многие дубы на востоке и в тёплых странах Америки, особенно
   в Калифорнии, они широко использовались в пищу американскими индейцами.
   Кроме того, жёлуди идут на корм скоту. Жёлуди дубов, произрастающих на
   территории России, идут только на приготовление желудёвого кофе.

   Также под дубами, образуя симбиотическую связь с их корневой системой,
   растут самые дорогие грибы — трюфели.

  Кофейный напиток из желудей[править | править код]

   Порошок для кофейного напитка можно приготовить как заранее, так и
   использовать свежий. Следует учитывать, что заранее приготовленный порошок
   достаточно быстро теряет аромат вследствие испарения и разрушения входящих
   в него масел. Для приготовления свежемолотого кофейного напитка специально
   заготовленные и приготовленные жёлуди перемалывают в кофемолке и варят как
   кофе. Заготавливаются спелые, крупные жёлуди зелёного цвета, твёрдые на
   ощупь, так как мягкие, продавливающиеся пальцем — червивые. Один из
   вариантов сушки: промытые жёлуди разложить на противне в один слой и
   поставить в разогретую духовку. За это время большинство желудей лопнет от
   испарения внутри влаги и приобретёт тёмно-коричневый цвет. Через десять
   минут вынуть и вышелушить жёлуди из скорлупы. Для приготовления порошка
   кофейного напитка жёлуди, пока они горячие, прокрутить через мясорубку и
   получившийся «фарш» разложить на противнях для дальнейшей сушки в духовке
   при открытой дверце. Хранить в тёмном месте, в герметично закрытой банке,
   либо в гигроскопичном полотняном или бумажном мешочке.

  В декоративном садоводстве[править | править код]

   Дубы часто высаживают для озеленения городов; так, Дуб болотный (Quercus
   palustris) — одна из наиболее популярных пород на востоке США и в Европе,
   а вечнозелёный Дуб виргинский (Quercus virginiana^[en]) — на юге США. В
   XVIII—XIX веках дуб часто использовался как солитер в дворцовых и
   усадебных парках. В этом случае его обычно сажали на поляне перед
   господским домом.

   В Крыму и на Кавказе можно с успехом выращивать дуб пробковый (Quercus
   suber).

Дубы-памятники и охраняемые дубы[править | править код]

   Существует множество отдельных деревьев из рода дуб, получивших широкую
   известность либо из-за своего возраста, или размера, или по иным
   уникальным причинам. Многие из них считаются достопримечательностями и
   находятся под охраной. Среди них можно отметить: Мамврийский дуб,
   Стелмужский дуб, Панский дуб, Царь-дуб, Дуб кайзера, Дуб-часовня, Богатырь
   Тавриды, 600-летний дуб, Гранитский дуб.

     * Во Франции растёт дуб, в дупле которого устроена небольшая комната
       шириной около трёх с половиной метров. В самой толстой стенке дупла
       вырезана небольшая скамейка. Через небольшое оконце в каморку
       проникает дневной свет. По самым скромным подсчётам, гигантскому дубу
       более двух тысяч лет^[7]^:41.
     * По преданию, православный монах Тихон жил до основания монастыря в
       дупле могучего дуба. Монастырь, основанный им, носит имя Тихонова
       пустынь^[7]^:41.
     * В одном болгарском селе молния попала в древний дуб и дерево сгорело
       дотла. Когда местные жители стали разносить золу по своим огородам, то
       обнаружили в ней металлический сосуд, полный золотых турецких монет.
       Этим монетам было более трёхсот лет. Клад, по-видимому, был спрятан в
       дупле могучего дерева. И если бы молния обошла его стороной, то дуб до
       сих пор хранил бы свою тайну^[7]^:44.

Дуб в культуре[править | править код]

  Музыка[править | править код]

   Волшебная флейта из оперы В. А. Моцарта вырезана из древесины
   тысячелетнего дуба. Волшебная флейта превращается затем в золотую.

   [IMG]От др.-греч. Δρυς — «дуб» произошло имя нимф Дриад — покровительниц
   деревьев в греческой мифологии^[9].

  Устное народное творчество[править | править код]

   В космическом миросозерцании славян мировое древо трансформировалось в
   фольклорный образ дуба, растущего на острове Буяне, посреди Океана-моря.
   «На Море-Океане, на Острове Буяне стоит дуб зелёный», — так начинаются
   многие русские народные сказки^[10]. По поверьям древних славян, в дупле
   древнего дуба живёт змей Змиулан, воплощающий стихию огня. Он может
   внушить любовь женщине, чтобы вступить с ней в брак. В качестве свадебного
   подарка змей приносит драгоценности, которые он достаёт через дупло из
   подземных кладовых. За помощью к Змиулану обращались мужчины, желающие
   внушить любовь к своей избраннице. На Руси бытовало поверье, что в дупле
   огромного дуба обитает Никола Дуплинский. И если ему усердно помолиться,
   то он выполнит любое желание^[7]^:40—41.

   У некоторых народов считалось, что поваленные бурей дуплистые деревья
   могут возвращать человеку молодость и приносить здоровье. Таким деревом в
   поэме Г. Лонгфелло «Песнь о Гайавате» оказывается дуб:

   На пути их, в дебрях леса
   Дуб лежал, погибший в бурю,
   Дуб-гигант, покрытый мохом,
   Полусгнивший под листвою,
   Почерневший и дуплистый.
   Увидав его, Осезо
   Испустил вдруг крик тоскливый
   И в дупло, как в яму, прыгнул.
   Старым, грязным, безобразным,
   Он упал в него, а вышел —
   Сильным, стройным и высоким, статным юношей, красавцем!^[7]^:41

   Король Падуб и Король Дуб — выделяемый Робертом Грейвсом архетип в
   европейском фольклоре, извечные противники, каждому из которых принадлежит
   половина года.

  Народные приметы[править | править код]

     * Дуб перед ясенем лист пустит — к сухому лету^[11].
     * Много желудей на дубе — к строгой зиме^[11].
     * Не сей пшеницы прежде дубового листа^[12].
     * Холодно, оттого что лист дуба развёртывается^[11].
     * Шумит зимой дубравушка — к непогодушке^[11].

  Пословицы и поговорки[править | править код]

   Русская народная пословица гласит: «Что ни дуб, то тулуп, что ни сосёнка,
   то избёнка»^[7]^:59. А советская пословица иронически обыгрывает крепость
   дуба: «Чем больше в армии дубов — тем крепче наша оборона».

   Английские:

     * Большие дубы вырастают из маленьких желудей. — англ. Great oaks from
       little acorns grow.
     * Буря валит дубы, а тростник не может сломать. — Oaks may fall when
       reeds stand the storm.

  Символика[править | править код]

   В Древней Греции дуб был посвящён Зевсу^[13] и Гераклу. Он является
   символом душевной и физической силы, а также долголетия^[14]. Дубовая
   ветвь символизировала силу, мощь и знатность рода, дубовыми венками
   награждали самых храбрых воинов. Крупные экземпляры дуба считались
   статуями Зевса. В Древнем Риме дуб был посвящён Юпитеру^[13], жёлуди
   назывались юпитеровыми плодами. Человека, спасшего жизнь римскому
   гражданину, принято было награждать дубовым венком, называвшимся corona
   civica^[15].

   У славян дуб олицетворял силу, мощь и был посвящён Перуну. Его называли
   Перуново дерево.

   У древних тевтонцев и литовцев бог дуба был богом грома, посылавшим дождь
   и оплодотворяющим землю.

   Кельты видели в нём символ выносливости и победоносности. Галлы
   рассматривали дуб в качестве оси мира^[14].

   В революционную эпоху во Франции дуб, в память о галльской традиции,
   символизировал свободу, надежду и преемственность. Его экземпляры были
   объявлены общественными памятниками, охраняемыми законом, у их подножия
   крестьяне сжигали помещичьи ценные бумаги, под их сенью подписывали важные
   документы и произносили гражданские клятвы^[14]^:103.

  Геральдика[править | править код]

   Изображение дуба можно увидеть на гербах городов и административных
   единиц.

   Клён (лат. Ácer) — род древесных растений семейства Сапиндовые
   (Sapindaceae), ранее помещался в семейство Клёновые (Aceraceae)^[3]^[4],
   которое ныне рассматривается в ранге трибы Клёновые (Acereae) в составе
   подсемейства Конскокаштановые (Hippocastanoideae).

   Клён широко распространён в Европе, Азии и Северной Америке. В словаре В.
   И. Даля указано: «Клён м. родовое названье дерев Асеr, обычно разумеют A.
   platanoides, русский клён»^[5].

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   Большинство видов клёна представляют собой деревья 10—40 метров высотой,
   но среди них встречаются и кустарники 5—10 метров высотой с рядом
   небольших веток, растущих от основания ствола.

   В основном листопадные растения, и только несколько видов из Южной Азии и
   Средиземноморья — вечнозелёные.

   Листья супротивные, у большинства видов дланевидные (пальчатые), с
   нечётным количеством жилок на каждой лопасти (их количество варьирует от
   трёх до девяти), одна из которых проходит посередине. Лишь у немногих
   видов листья сложно-пальчатые, сложно-перистые, с перистым жилкованием или
   без лопастей.

   У нескольких видов, таких как Клён серый (Acer griseum), Клён
   трёхцветковый (Acer triflorum), Клён маньчжурский (Acer mandshuricum) и
   Клён Максимовича (Acer maximowiczianum), листья тройчатые (трилистники). У
   клёна ясенелистного (Acer negundo) листья сложно-перистые и могут состоять
   из трёх, пяти, семи, редко девяти листиков. У клёна граболистного (Acer
   carpinifolium) листья простые и с перистым жилкованием, напоминают
   грабовые.

   [IMG]Цветок клёна остролистного с нектарным кольцом

   Цветки с пятью симметрично расположенными лепестками, собраны в кисть,
   щиток или зонтик. Они имеют пять чашелистиков, пять лепестков от 1 до 6 мм
   длиной, двенадцать тычинок 6—10 мм и два пестика разных типов. Завязь
   расположена выше и имеет два плодолистика, чьи крылышки вытягиваются из
   цветка — по этому признаку легко определить, какой цветок является
   женским. Клёны цветут в конце зимы или ранней весной, у большинства видов
   сразу после появления листьев, а у некоторых и до. Цветки зелёные, жёлтые,
   оранжевые или красные, и хотя каждый из них очень мал, при цветении
   некоторых видов у человека при взгляде издалека возникает впечатление
   полностью цветущего дерева.

   Нектарник представляет собой плоское кольцо и расположен между лепестками
   и тычинками^[6]^:35, у клёна остролистного он простирается до завязи, и
   основания тычинок погружены в него^[7]^:358.

   Плод, называемый двукрылаткой, состоит из двух одинаковых частей и при
   падении вращается, унося семя на значительное расстояние. Плод созревает в
   промежутке от двух до шести недель после цветения.

Распространение[править | править код]

   Клёны широко распространены в Северном полушарии, от полярных областей
   Европы и Северной Америки до тропических районов Центральной Америки и
   Южной Азии. В основном распространены в умеренных широтах, в тропиках
   известны только несколько видов, а в Южном полушарии только один вид —
   Клён лавровый (Acer laurinum), который доходит до острова Тимор в
   Индонезии (10° южной широты). На территории Африки клёны присутствуют
   только на самом севере, вдоль побережья Средиземного моря, а в Южной
   Америке и Австралии отсутствуют вовсе.

   На территории Российской Федерации известны около двадцати видов клёнов,
   среди которых широко распространены Клён остролистный (Acer platanoides),
   Клён татарский (Acer tataricum), Клён полевой (Acer campestre) и Клён
   белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus). В основном они растут в
   европейской части России, а в Сибири очень распространён завезённый из
   Северной Америки Клён ясенелистный, или американский (Acer negundo), очень
   агрессивный инвазионный вид. В Красную книгу России занесён Клён японский
   (Acer japonicum).

   Клёны в южной части ареала в основном предпочитают горные районы,
   поднимаясь в высоту до 3000 м над уровнем моря в Гималаях. На равнинах
   растёт относительно небольшое количество видов. Растут эти деревья
   поодиночке либо небольшими группами, самостоятельные леса образуют крайне
   редко.

   В европейской части России растут четыре вида:

     * Клён татарский (Acer tataricum L.),
     * Клён белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus L.),
     * Клён полевой (Acer campestre L.) — занесён в Красную книгу
       Подмосковья, через которое проходит северная граница его ареала,
     * Клён остролистный (Acer platanoides L.),

   из которых только последний вид распространён обширно (на север — до 62°).

   На Дальнем Востоке России встречаются:

     * Клён мелколистный (Acer mono),
     * Клён приречный (Acer ginnala),
     * Клён ложнозибольдов (Acer pseudosieboldianum), в Приморском крае
       найден клён микрозибольдов^[8], вероятно, являющийся разновидностью
       клёна ложнозибольдова,
     * Клён-берёза, или Клён жёлтый (Acer ukurunduense) — в Приморье и
       Приамурье,
     * Клён зеленокорый (Acer tegmentosum) и
     * Клён маньчжурский (Acer mandshuricum) — в основном в Приморье,
     * Клён японский (Acer japonicum) — на Курилах (Кунашир),
     * Клён бородатый (Acer barbinerve Maxim.),
     * Клён Чоноски (Acer tschonoskii Maxim.) — юг Сахалинской области, в
       Приморье растёт его подвид (?) клён Комарова,

   В Крыму известны только:

     * Acer campestre L.,
     * Acer valum Lauth. (Acer opulifolium Vill.),
     * Acer platanoides L.,
     * Клён Стевена (Acer stevenii Pojark)^[9].

   Кавказ очень богат видами клёна — кроме перечисленных выше европейских
   видов, здесь также встречаются:

     * Клён Траутфеттера, или высокогорный (Acer trautvetteri Medw.)
     * Acer velutinum Boiss. — в России вид не отмечен,
     * Клён гирканский (Acer hyrcanum Fisch. et C.A.Mey.) — Азербайджан и
       Дагестан,
     * Клён монпелийский (Acer monspessulanum L.),
     * Клён колхидский (Acer cappadocicum Gled.),
     * Клён Сосновского (Acer sosnowskyi Doluch.) — включён в Красную книгу
       Краснодарского края.

   Близкий к ложноплатановому клёну вид, Acer ambiguum Heer, известен из
   олигоцена в Гренландии и Шпицбергене и из миоцена на Сахалине, а в
   плиоценовых отложениях он найден на Алтае. Здесь же найдены близкий к Acer
   lobelii Ten. или тождественный с ним Acer laetum C.A.Mey. и Acer
   nordenskioldi Nath., который И. Ф. Шмальгаузен соединяет с современным
   японским клёном дланевидным (Acer palmatum Thunb.).

   На территории Евразии сформировал обширный вторичный ареал также Клён
   ясенелистный (Acer negundo L.), родом из Северной Америки. Ранее широко
   использовался в России в озеленении парков, садов, скверов в городах
   центральных областей европейской части России, Сибири, Средней Азии и
   Дальнего Востока. Сейчас распространяется самосевом.

Болезни и вредители[править | править код]

   [IMG]Гриб Rhytisma acerinum на листьях клёна белого

   Листья клёнов поедают личинки многих видов чешуекрылых (см. Список видов
   чешуекрылых, питающихся клёнами). Тля также очень часто поселяется на этих
   деревьях. При разведении клёнов в культуре с насекомыми борются
   распылением диметоата.

   В США и Канаде все виды клёна поражаются азиатским усачом (Anoplophora
   glabripennis). Результатом заражения этим вредителем стала гибель тысяч
   клёнов и других видов деревьев в Иллинойсе, Массачусетсе, Нью-Джерси и
   штате Нью-Йорк.

   Клёны подвержены различным грибковым заболеваниям. Для многих характерно
   вертициллёзное увядание, вызванное различными видами грибков рода
   Verticillium  (англ.) (рус., которое может наносить большой ущерб
   популяции клёнов. Чёрная плесень коры, вызываемая видами Cryptostroma,
   может убить деревья, которые подвержены стрессу из-за сухости. Изредка
   клёны гибнут из-за корневой гнили, вызванной видами Phytophthora или
   Ganoderma (Ганодерма). Поздним летом и осенью листья клёнов обычно
   испещрены «смоляными пятнами», причиной которых являются виды Rhytisma, и
   мучнистой росой, вызываемой видами Uncinula, однако эти болезни обычно не
   наносят существенного и долговременного ущерба здоровью деревьев^[10].

Использование[править | править код]

   См. также: Клён (древесина)
   [IMG]Древесина клёна

   Клёны ценятся в декоративном садоводстве и паркостроении за красоту кроны,
   зимний цвет коры, ажурную листву, яркий осенний наряд. Почти все виды
   клёнов используются как декоративные деревья, часто в качестве солитера в
   ландшафтном дизайне.

   Некоторые виды клёна используются для получения кленового сиропа и сахара.
   В весеннем кленовом соке содержится сахар, содержание его — 3 %. Поскольку
   у клёна сахарного (Acer saccharum) сок ещё слаще — более чем 4 %, — именно
   он используется в промышленных масштабах для производства сахара (особенно
   широко в Канаде, вследствие чего клён стал туристической
   достопримечательностью этой страны). Сок собирают обычным методом надрезки
   ствола, затем уваривают до сиропа. У кленового сахара свой вкус, и многие
   предпочитают его свекловичному и иным видам сахара.

   В качестве древесины в Северной Америке используют клён сахарный, в Европе
   клён белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus). Тяжёлая, твёрдая,
   плотная и прочная мелкопористая древесина клёна обладает красивым
   рисунком, формируемым узкими тёмными сердцевинными лучами, придающими ей
   особую декоративность. Древесина клёна использовалась в столярном деле для
   изготовления гнутой мебели, музыкальных инструментов (барабаны, гитары,
   скрипки, духовые инструменты), линеек, лыж, прялок, кулаков мельничных
   колёс, ружейных лож; клён шёл на сапожные гвозди, мясные колоды, ободья,
   топорища (лучшие — из клёна татарского). В старину из клёна мастерили
   кухонные приборы и вёсла. Из клёна сахарного изготавливают кегли для
   боулинга, бейсбольные биты (хотя и реже, чем из ясеня или гикори).

   Древесина отдельных видов обладает декоративной волнистой текстурой,
   которую можно определить только при распиле. Её используют для
   производства шпона, для декоративной отделки мебели.

   Клён — отличный медонос. Клёны являются важными источниками пыльцы и
   нектара для пчёл ранней весной. Поскольку клёны крайне важны для выживания

   Я́блоня (лат. Mālus) — род листопадных деревьев и кустарников семейства
   Розовые (Rosaceae) с шаровидными сладкими или кисло-сладкими плодами.
   Происходит из зон умеренного климата Северного полушария.

   Род относится к трибе Яблоневые (Maleae) подсемейства Сливовые
   (Prunoideae)^[1]. Насчитывает 62 вида (2013)^[2]. Наиболее распространены:
   яблоня домашняя, или культурная (Malus domestica), к которой относится
   большинство возделываемых в мире сортов (число которых превышает 10
   тысяч^[3]), яблоня сливолистная, китайская (Malus prunifolia) и яблоня
   низкая (Malus pumila).

   [IMG]Яблоневый сад [IMG]Яблоки

   Многие виды яблони выращивают в качестве декоративных растений в садах и
   парках, используют в полезащитном лесоразведении. Все виды — хорошие
   медоносы. Древесина у яблони плотная, крепкая, легко режется и хорошо
   полируется; пригодна для токарных и столярных изделий, мелких поделок^[4].

Название[править | править код]

   Русское слово яблоко возникло в результате прибавления протетического
   начального j- к праслав. *ablъko; последнее образовано с помощью суффикса
   -ъk- от позднепраиндоевропейской основы *āblu- "яблоко" (к той же основе
   восходят лит. obuolỹs, латыш. ābols, англ. apple, нем. Apfel, галльск.
   avallo, др.‑ирл. aball^[5]^[6]). Данная основа представляет собой
   регионализм северо-западных индоевропейских языков и восходит, в свою
   очередь, к общеиндоевропейской основе (реконструируемой как *(a)masl-^[7]
   или как *ŝamlu-^[6]). С суффиксом -onь- та же основа дала яблонь
   (позднейшее яблоня)^[8].

   [IMG]Яблоня домашняя. Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги О. В. Томе Flora
   von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, 1885

   Латинские слова mālum ‘яблоко’ и mālus ‘яблоня’ также восходят к пра-и.е.
   *(a)masl-/*ŝamlu-^[7].

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   Деревья с развесистой кроной высотой 2,5—15 м. Ветви — укороченные
   (плодущие), на которых закладываются цветочные почки, и удлинённые
   (ростовые). У дикорастущих видов на ветвях имеются колючки.

   Листья черешковые, голые или опушённые снизу, с опадающими или остающимися
   прилистниками.

   Цветки собраны в немногоцветковые полузонтиковидные или щитковидные
   соцветия. Окраска цветков может изменяться от совершенно белой до
   нежно-розовой и ярко-малиновой^[4]. Цветки яблони протогиничны: гинецей
   созревает раньше андроцея. Опыляются насекомыми^[3].

   Плод — яблоко, возникающее из нижней завязи. Гинецей заключён в нижнюю
   завязь^[4]. По мере формирования плода плодолистики становятся
   хрящеватыми, пергаментными, кожистыми. На разрезе плода чётко видна
   граница между тканями гипантия и тканями завязи, очерченная окружностью
   более плотно расположенных клеток и сосудистых пучков^[3].

   Формула цветка: [IMG] \ast Ca_{5}\;Co_{5}\;A_{{(5+5)}}\;G_{{(\overline
   5)}}^[9].

Распространение[править | править код]

   Всего на территории бывшего СССР известно свыше десяти видов. Из
   дикорастущих видов в лесах Европейской части и на Кавказе произрастает
   яблоня лесная (Malus sylvestris); в Малой Азии, Иране, Крыму и на
   Кавказе — яблоня восточная (Malus orientalis); в Китае, Монголии,
   Приморском крае, Восточной Сибири — яблоня ягодная (Malus baccata); в
   лесах Тянь-Шаня — яблоня Недзвецкого (Malus niedzwetzkyana), в
   окрестностях Алма-Аты — яблоня Сиверса (Malus sieversii), дикий предок
   многих культурных сортов яблок.

История разведения[править | править код]

   [IMG]Яблони в период цветения

   Дикорастущими яблоками предки современного человека питались всегда.
   Родиной одомашненной яблони является территория современного южного
   Казахстана и Киргизии (предгорья Алатау), где до сих пор встречается в
   диком виде яблоня Сиверса, от которой и произошла яблоня
   домашняя^[10]^[11]. Предположительно, оттуда во времена Александра
   Македонского либо во время иных миграций она попала в Европу. По другой
   версии, это фруктовое дерево первоначально произрастало в районе между
   Каспийским и Чёрным морями, а уже оттуда было завезено в другие районы
   мира^[12]^[неавторитетный источник]. Обугленные остатки яблони обнаружены
   при раскопках доисторических озёрных стоянок Швейцарии; по-видимому,
   жители Европы хорошо знали яблоню ещё во времена неолита, но одомашнивание
   её в данной части света произошло значительно позднее^[6].

   Колыбелью яблоневодства в Европе была Древняя Греция. Писатели Древнего
   Рима — Катон, Варрон, Колумелла, Плиний Старший — описывали 36 сортов
   яблони, выращиваемых в их время^[13]. В европейской культуре яблоня быстро
   заняла важное место. Общеевропейским можно считать мотив «золотых яблок»,
   якобы дарующих бессмертие и вечную молодость и потому часто
   похищаемых^[6]. Даже слово «рай» по-кельтски звучит как Авалон («страна
   яблок»)^[13].

   В русских землях культурная яблоня впервые появилась в XI веке в
   монастырских садах Киевской Руси; так, при Ярославе Мудром (в 1051 году)
   был заложен яблоневый сад, позже известный как сад Киево-Печерской
   лавры^[14]. В XVI веке яблоня появилась и в северных районах Руси. Для
   выведения культурных сортов яблони были использованы четыре её вида:
   яблоня низкая, яблоня лесная, яблоня ягодная и яблоня сливолистная, или
   китайская.

   [IMG]Яблоки

   Размер красных, зелёных или жёлтых шаровидных плодов в зависимости от вида
   может быть с горошину или достигать 15 см в диаметре.

   По времени созревания отличают летние, осенние и зимние сорта, более
   поздние сорта отличаются хорошей стойкостью.

   Плоды содержат яблочную, винную, лимонную и другие органические кислоты,
   сахара (глюкозу, сахарозу и другие), витамины С, А, В1, каротин, дубильные
   и пектиновые вещества, микроэлементы (железо, медь), макроэлементы (калий,
   кальций, магний и другие), эфирное масло, и другие вещества.

   Плоды употребляют в свежем виде и в виде сухофруктов; они пригодны также
   для различных видов переработки: получения соков, компотов, киселей и
   плодового вина, сидра, приготовления варенья, а благодаря содержанию
   пектина — джемов, повидла, желе и мусса. Яблоки запекают с сахаром в
   тесте, приготовляют начинки для пирогов, тортов и пирожных, очень
   популярны яблочные пироги.

   Сушёные яблоки являются хорошим источником легкоусваиваемых сахаров
   (содержат от 8 до 15 %), микроэлементов (до 0,5 % различных минеральных
   солей), а в семенах одного среднего плода содержится около суточной нормы
   йода

   Например, яблоки антоновского сорта в 100 граммах при калорийности в 48
   ккал содержат: 0,3 г белков, 11,5 г углеводов, 0,02 мг витамина B1, 4,9 мг
   витамина С, 16 мг кальция и 86 мг калия.

   Плоды дикорастущих видов в основном перерабатывают.

   Некоторые известные сорта:

     * Апорт
     * Бабушкино
     * Мекинтош
     * Слава переможцам

   Ещё более 200 видовых названий этого рода (в том числе, к примеру, Malus
   bhutanica J.B.Phipps) имеют в The Plant List (2013) статус unresolved
   name, то есть относительно этих названий нельзя однозначно сказать,
   следует ли их использовать как названия самостоятельных видов — либо их
   следует свести в синонимику других таксонов^[2].

   Раньше иногда также выделяли вид Яблоня гибридная (Malus hybridus).

Гибридные роды[править | править код]

   Гибридные роды с участием представителей рода Яблоня:

     * ×Malosorbus — Малосорбус (= Sorbus × Malus)
     * ×Marus — Марюс (= Pyrus × Malus). Яблоне-грушевые межродовые гибриды
     * ×Malonia — Малония (= Cydonia × Malus). Яблоне-айвовые межродовые
       гибриды

Культивирование[править | править код]

   [IMG]Яблоня с газелями и львами. Византийская напольная мозаика,
   724—743 гг.

   Яблони разводят в большинстве областей с умеренным климатом. Среди всех
   плодовых растений умеренных широт яблоне принадлежит первое место по
   площади посадок и по урожаям. Немало сортов яблонь дают урожай по тонне
   плодов с одного дерева и выше^[16].

   В современных садах практически все яблони состоят из двух компонентов:
   подвоя (корневая система и корневая шейка) и сращенного с ним посредством
   прививки или окулировки сортового привоя (штамб и крона). При закладке
   современных интенсивных садов с высотой деревьев 2-3 метра, используются
   карликовые и полукарликовые клоновые подвои яблони^[17].

   Коммерческие сады размещены в местах, где не бывает экстремальных
   температур, почвы плодородны и достаточно воды для полива. Главные мировые
   производители плодов — Германия, Италия, Франция, Испания, Китай, Япония,
   США, Канада, Аргентина, Чили, Австралия, Новая Зеландия и ЮАР. Примерно
   половина продаваемых яблок приходится на сорта «Delicious» и «Golden
   Delicious», которые наиболее распространены в США. Оба этих сорта могут
   расти в широком диапазоне условий.

   В садах средней полосы России выращивают: ранние «Китайка золотая»
   (мичуринский сорт), «Грушовка московская» (старинный вид), «Папировка» или
   «Белый налив» (отличается особенно сладким и крепким плодом); осенние
   «Коричное полосатое» (плод хорошо сохраняет форму в варенье), «Анисы»
   (старинные русские сорта), «Бельфлёр-китайка» (мичуринский десертный,
   лучший среди осенних сортов); а наиболее популярен зимний — «Антоновка»
   (старинный русский сорт хороший свежим, для любой переработки и хранения
   плодом).

   Джонсона Хеда (1819—1904)

   В садах южной полосы выделяются: устойчивыми к хранению плодами сорт —
   «Розмарин», ароматный десертный «Белый зимний кальвиль»; многочисленные
   ренеты: «Бумажный ренет», «Красный шафран», «Полосатый шафран»; синапы:
   «Кандиль-синап», «Сары-синап»; «Апорт» (особенно качественный
   алма-атинский).

                                Рубрика: Деревья

   Деревья входят одну из самых больших групп древесных растений. Являются
   крупными представителями флоры с многолетним стволом, который способен
   развиваться на протяжении долгого времени. Подразделяются на 2 базовые
   породы.

   Хвойные — это ели, лиственницы, сосны, пихты, кипарисы, секвойи, тсуги,
   туи, можжевельники, кедры. Лиственные — эвкалипты, ясени, буки, клены,
   тополи, платаны, абаши, березы, дубы и многие другие.

   Еще один критерий классификации — продолжительность жизни листьев, исходя
   из чего они бывают вечнозелеными или листопадными. Также имеется еще одно
   крупное разделение деревьев на несколько сортов: плодовые (их фрукты и
   ягоды предназначены для пищи), ценные (идут на
   промышленно-производственные цели), корабельные (используются для
   постройки судов), тропические (произрастают на экваторе и близ него),
   северные (распространены далеко от экваториальной зоны).

   При этом древесина лиственных пород намного тверже и располагает рядом
   преимуществ. Она почти не подвержена гниению, красивее по рисунку, но в то
   же время гораздо тяжелее. Подходит для интерьерных и мебельных работ.

   У хвойных рисунок менее экспрессивный, а сам ствол изобилует смоляными
   карманами. Однако это незаменимый строительный материал с массой
   декоративных и отделочных возможностей.

Какое дерево самое легкое в мире?

   Деревья удивительны. Одни поражают невероятным рисунком, другие —
   твердостью, третьи — малым весом. Например, самое легкое дерево человек
   может запросто унести самостоятельно — даже если…

                              16 фактов о деревьях

   Зачем сажать деревья и в чём их польза для человека и окружающей среды?
   Сколько они производят кислорода и как образуют облака?

   Выделяют кислород

  1.

   Чем дерево крупнее и старше, тем больше кислорода. В среднем человек
   вдыхает около 550 л кислорода в день — такой объём производят два взрослых
   дуба

   Очищают воздух

  2.

   Деревья поглощают вредные химические вещества и задерживают частицы дыма,
   пыли и золы. Благодаря этому воздух становится чище, снижается риск
   респираторных заболеваний. Содержание пыли в воздухе на озеленённой улице
   в три раза меньше, чем на улице без деревьев

   Укрепляют иммунитет

  3.

   Леса — источник продуктов питания, в которых много полезных питательных
   веществ. Грибы, мёд, фрукты, орехи и семена в рационе повышают
   разнообразие микрофлоры кишечника, что важно для поддержания иммунитета

   Борются с вирусами и бактериями

  4.

   Деревья вырабатывают фитонциды — вещества, подавляющие вирусы и бактерии.
   Например, 1 га зарослей можжевельника выделяет в сутки до 30 кг
   фитонцидов — это примерно в шесть раз больше, чем другие хвойные породы,
   и в 15 раз больше, чем лиственные деревья

   Улучшают настроение

  5.

   Прогулки в парках и лесах дарят положительные эмоции, снижают уровень
   усталости и стресса. Они помогают восстановить силы и улучшают
   концентрацию внимания

   Защищают от ультрафио-
   лета

  6.

   Деревья уменьшают воздействие ультрафиолетовых лучей типа UVB примерно
   на 50%. Это особенно важно для мест, где взрослые и дети проводят много
   времени на открытом воздухе

   Снижают температуру воздуха

  7.

   Тень от деревьев на домах и дорогах улиц может уменьшить температуру
   воздуха на 4-5 ℃

   Снижают уровень шума

  8.

   Зелёные насаждения помогают решить проблему шумового загрязнения
   в городах. Одно зрелое дерево может снизить шум до 6 децибел. Кроны
   лиственных пород поглощают около 26% попадающей на них звуковой энергии,
   отражают и рассеивают около 74%

   Замедляют изменения климата

  9.

   В солнечные дни 1 га леса поглощает за сутки 220–280 кг углекислого газа —
   это объём выбросов, которые генерируют 18–23 легковых автомобилей за один
   день

   Служат домом для животных и растений

  10.

   В лесу соседствуют насекомые, млекопитающие, грибы, мхи и другие растения.
   На разных видах деревьев обитает более 280 видов насекомых, которыми
   питаются птицы и хищники

   Мешают паводкам

  11.

   Деревья поддерживают запасы подземных вод и снижают риск обильных
   паводков. Весной в лесу снег тает постепенно, глубоко проникая в почву.
   Поэтому паводки в лесной зоне не такие сильные, как на лугах и полях

   Собирают дождевую воду

  12.

   Во время дождя кроны помогают распределить поток воды. Она стекает
   по ветвям и стволу к корням и частично впитывается в почву. Так деревья
   помогают снизить масштабы затоплений или вовсе их избежать

   Сохраняют здоровье почвы

  13.

   Леса поддерживают плодородность почвы. Опавшая с деревьев листва
   разлагается и возвращает в почву органические вещества. В то же время
   развитые корни деревьев защищают верхние слои почвы от разрушения ветром
   и водой

   Создают облака

  14.

   Благодаря лесу образуются облака. Деревья выделяют водяной пар через
   листья. Он поднимается в атмосферу и превращается в дождевые облака

   Растут дольше, чем люди

  15.

   Саженец сосны растёт в среднем по 50–70 см в год. Чтобы вырасти до зрелого
   25-метрового дерева, ему потребуется не менее 30 лет. Ежегодно люди
   вырубают около 10 млн га лесов. Новые деревья не успевают вырастать,
   поэтому важно помогать лесу восстанавливать запасы

   Бонус

   Переработка макулатуры сохраняет ресурсы

  16.

   Тонна переработанной бумаги сохраняет 17 деревьев, около 32 тыс. л воды
   и 4000 кВт электроэнергии

   ДЕРЕВО, многолетнее растение с одревесневающим прямостоячим главным
   стеблем – стволом. Более детальное или четкое определение этой «жизненной
   форме» дать трудно из-за разнообразия размеров и внешнего вида растений,
   которые называют деревьями. Даже банан, например, часто считают деревом,
   хотя стебель у него травянистый. Иногда в определении дерева специально
   подчеркивают, что его ствол последовательно разделяется на все более
   тонкие ветви или что у дерева есть четкая облиственная крона. Однако
   стволы большинства пальм вообще не ветвятся, а у гигантских кактусов
   одревесневший ствол, если и несет боковые ветви, никакой кроной не
   увенчивается.

   Многие определения устанавливают минимальную высоту растения, которое
   можно назвать деревом, но у разных авторов этот показатель колеблется от 2
   до 6 м. Иногда эту жизненную форму приписывают всему виду, а в других
   случаях – только определенным экземплярам конкретного таксона. Так,
   стелющиеся растения в высокогорьях или Арктике можно называть деревьями,
   поскольку при более благоприятных условиях представители этого вида
   прямостоячие и довольно высокие. В других случаях растение не превышает в
   высоту нескольких дециметров, например в питомнике или в декоративной
   карликовой форме, созданной школой бонзай, однако по всем прочим признакам
   соответствует дереву. Все экземпляры, соответствующие в зрелом состоянии
   классическому дереву, начинают свое естественное развитие с семени или
   крошечного вегетативного проростка. В связи с этим встает вопрос: с какого
   момента их можно считать деревьями.

   Для некоторых целей могут потребоваться довольно жесткие определения,
   однако в целом термин «дерево» предполагает широкий диапазон
   интерпретаций.

   СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ
   СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ

   Расплывчатость понятия «дерево», очевидно, порождает и нечеткость в
   разграничении между деревом и еще одной группой прямостоячих деревянистых
   растений – кустарниками. Считается, что у последних всегда несколько
   стволов, среди которых нельзя однозначно выделить главный. Высота
   кустарников редко превышает 3 м, хотя среди них встречаются и
   восьмиметровые. В целом, у видов, традиционно считающихся кустарниками,
   редко встречаются «древовидные» экземпляры, однако исключения известны в
   таких родах, как, например, сумах, ольха, ирга, церкокарпус, кизил, ива,
   бузина. В то же время очень многие виды, относимые к типичным деревьям,
   могут давать кустарниковые формы. Некоторые деревья, если их срубить или
   сжечь, образуют корневую или пневую поросль, которая в конечном итоге
   развивается в крупное растение с несколькими стволами, среди которых
   далеко не всегда можно указать главный. Тем не менее в этом случае
   логичнее было бы говорить не о кустарнике, а о многоствольном дереве.
   Кстати, если в лесу таких деревьев много, вполне вероятно, что он
   вырубался или горел.

Географическое распространение.

   Деревья растут на значительной части суши, а также на мелких участках
   пресных и соленых водоемов. Отсутствуют они в приполярных областях,
   высокогорьях и крайне засушливых местах. В Западном полушарии ареал этой
   жизненной формы простирается от залива Маккензи на западе Канады примерно
   на 14,5 тыс. км к югу до Огненной Земли. В Восточном полушарии деревья
   растут от полуострова Таймыр в России до новозеландского острова Южный,
   между которыми по меридиану ок. 13 тыс. км. См. также ФИТОГЕОГРАФИЯ.

   Деревья – самые крупные и самые долгоживущие из современных организмов.
   Рекордсмен по размерам – секвойядендрон (мамонтово дерево) «Генерал
   Шерман» из национального парка Секвойя в Калифорнии. В 1975 высота этого
   дерева составляла 84 м при диаметре основания ствола более 11 м. На высоте
   37 м ствол был толщиной 5 м, а самая нижняя ветвь, отходящая от ствола
   примерно на высоте 40 м, имела длину 46 м при диаметре 2,1 м. Одна эта
   ветвь превышает своими размерами многие деревья других видов. Объем
   древесины этого экземпляра составляет ок. 1400 куб. м – достаточно, чтобы
   покрыть паркетом толщиной 30 см целое футбольное поле.

   На втором месте стоит другой секвойядендрон – «Генерал Грант» из
   калифорнийского национального парка Кингс-Каньон. По данным последних
   измерений, его высота 81,5 м, диаметр основания 10,2 м, а объем древесины
   – 1219 куб. м. На западном склоне Сьерра-Невады (Калифорния) растут сотни
   секвойядендронов высотой 60–90 м.

   Шесть самых высоких в мире деревьев – секвойи, близкие родственники
   мамонтовых деревьев. Чемпион среди них растет в национальном парке Редвуд
   в Калифорнии. По данным последних измерений, его высота 111 м при диаметре
   основания 4,3 м. Прежний чемпион был в 1955 примерно на 0,3 м выше, но его
   вершину сломал ветер.

   По слухам, существуют еще более высокие – до 120 м – гиганты. Сегодня
   живые дугласии выше 100 м неизвестны, но в 1900 был якобы срублен
   экземпляр этого вида высотой 116 м. Путешественники сообщают о гигантских
   австралийских эвкалиптах, однако высота самого крупного измеренного
   представителя этого рода – эвкалипта Дальримпля, срубленного около Коласа
   в штате Виктория, оказалась «всего» 105 м, а у другого экземпляра, до сих
   пор растущего около Мельбурна, она не более 99 м.

   Самое толстое известное дерево – таксодиум, или болотный кипарис, растущий
   в городке Санта-Мария-дель-Туле около Оахаки в Мексике. Диаметр основания
   его ствола (вероятно, образованного несколькими сросшимися стволами)
   составляет 11 м. Чтобы обхватить это дерево, нужно поставить вокруг него
   20 человек с вытянутыми в стороны руками. У баобаба на одном из островов
   около Явы в Индийском океане диаметр ствола 9 м, у агатисов с Новой
   Зеландии, туй с западного побережья США и ряда других видов он достигает
   6–7,6 м. Еще один рекорд зафиксирован на западе Индии, где растет баньян
   (фикус бенгальский), у которого 350 крупных стволов и 300 более мелких.
   Вместе они занимают участок периметром 600 м, т.е. площадью ок. 2,8 га.

   Из разных регионов сообщалось о находках очень древних деревьев. Например,
   возраст некоторых макрозамий в Австралии оценивался в 12 000 лет, однако
   эти саговниковые не образуют годичных колец, так что проверить точность
   предлагаемой датировки невозможно. По имеющимся оценкам, калифорнийские
   секвойядендроны доживают до 5000 лет, но число действительно подсчитанных
   у них годичных колец пока не превышает 3200. Возможная продолжительность
   жизни африканских баобабов составляет, как полагают, ок. 4000 лет, а
   индийских баньянов – ок. 3000. Официально зафиксированный рекорд
   принадлежит сосне долговечной. Примерно 20 деревьев этого вида возрастом
   более 4000 лет растут на высоте ок. 3000 м над уровнем моря в горах
   Уайт-Маунтинс на востоке Калифорнии, причем одному из них примерно 4600
   лет. Другая группа очень древних сосен долговечных известна на горе
   Уилер-Пик в национальном парке Гумбольдт (шт. Невада).

Значение для человека.

   Деревья дают древесину для строительства домов и других сооружений,
   изготовления железнодорожных шпал и столбов электропередачи, а также для
   производства практически всей мебели и бумаги. Из древесины различными
   методами, например сухой перегонкой, экстрагированием водой или
   органическими растворителями, гидролизом и гидрированием, получают
   разнообразные химические соединения, в том числе метиловый (древесный)
   спирт, ацетон, уксусную кислоту, скипидар, сахара, дубильные вещества,
   канифоль, камфору, сассафрасовое и другие эфирные масла. К продуктам
   древесного происхождения относятся также пробка из коры средиземноморского
   дуба пробкового, латекс – млечный сок многих тропических деревьев,
   служащий сырьем для производства резины, жевательной резинки и гуттаперчи,
   капок – набивочный и теплоизоляционный материал из плодов хлопчатого
   дерева (сейбы), хинин из коры хинного дерева, растущего в южноамериканских
   Андах, и многие другие. Большие количества древесины до сих пор сжигаются
   как топливо.

   Плоды деревьев служат важным источником пищи не только для диких животных,
   но и для человека. Кофе делают из обжаренных семян кофейного дерева, какао
   и шоколад – из семян южноамериканского шоколадного дерева, пряность
   гвоздика – это сушеные бутоны тропического гвоздичного дерева, корица –
   размолотая кора коричного дерева, мускатный орех – семя мускатника родом с
   Молуккских островов на востоке Индонезии. Плоды многих деревьев мы едим в
   свежем виде.

   Потребляя в процессе фотосинтеза углекислый газ и выделяя кислород,
   деревья и их сообщества – леса, в первую очередь тропические, вносят
   огромный вклад в поддержание баланса этих газов в атмосфере Земли. К
   другим важным функциям леса относятся формирование и улучшение почвы, а
   также ее защита от эрозии. Действительно, значительная часть богатейших
   почв мира сформировалась в свое время под лесным пологом, а там, где леса
   сводятся и применяются нерациональные способы обработки почвы, плодородие
   ее быстро падает, начинается эрозия и появляются овраги. В зонах выпадения
   большого количества осадков лес – лучшая защита для почвы от
   разрушительной силы воды. Кроны деревьев смягчают ударный эффект дождевых
   капель, а лесная подстилка из опавших листьев, цветков, ветвей и другого
   мертвого растительного материала не дает воде размывать поверхность земли,
   способствует сохранению комковатой структуры грунта, впитыванию и
   удержанию им влаги, а тем самым формированию подземного водоносного
   горизонта, равномерно питающего протекающие в данном районе ручьи и реки.
   Проникновение в почву воды облегчают и многочисленные роющие животные
   лесов – дождевые черви, различные насекомые и мелкие млекопитающие.

   Леса и зеленые насаждения в целом смягчают местный климат, не давая
   солнечным лучам сильно нагревать и иссушать землю, препятствуя ее
   охлаждению, испаряя в воздух большое количество водяного пара и снижая
   скорость ветра. Тень и прохлада лесов, парков и скверов в сочетании с
   красотой их разнообразной растительности и животного мира создают
   атмосферу спокойствия и уединенности, высоко ценимую выбравшимися
   отдохнуть горожанами. Деревья, широко используемые для озеленения
   населенных пунктов, имеют не только эстетическое, климатическое и
   рекреационное значение, но и служат улавливающим пыль и вредные газы
   фильтром, а также обогащают воздух кислородом.

Основные группы деревьев.

   К деревьям принято относить и некоторые древовидные папоротники,
   гигантские кактусы и одревесневающие злаки, например бамбуки, однако
   подавляющее большинство растений, представленных этой жизненной формой, –
   хвойные и т.н. широколиственные древесные породы.

   Хвойные отличаются обычно жесткими, по большей части вечнозелеными,
   игловидными или чешуйчатыми листьями, никогда не цветут и образуют шишки
   или производные от них структуры типа можжевеловых ягод. К этой группе
   относятся, например, сосны, ели, пихты, лиственницы, кипарисы, секвойи,
   кедры, туи. Среди широколиственных деревьев достаточно упомянуть дубы,
   клены, буки, ясени, грецкие орехи, ивы, магнолии, яблони, березы, баобабы
   и эвкалипты. Все они цветут и образуют плоды. Многие виды листопадные,
   т.е. сбрасывают листву в холодное или сухое время года, но достаточно и
   вечнозеленых, особенно в тропиках и субтропиках. Термин «полулистопадный
   (полувечнозеленый) лес» означает, что часть деревьев в нем листопадные
   (обычно в верхнем ярусе), а остальные – вечнозеленые.

ОСНОВНЫЕ ЧАСТИ ДЕРЕВА

   Деревья, за исключением древовидных папоротников, – семенные растения,
   состоящие из корней, стебля, листьев и репродуктивных (половых) органов,
   т.е. шишек или цветков. Чтобы удобнее было описывать строение и функции
   каждой из этих структур, мы будем рассматривать их по отдельности, однако
   постоянно помня о неразрывной взаимосвязи и координации работы всех систем
   живого дерева.

Корневая система.

   Корни механически закрепляют ствол дерева в почве, обеспечивая его
   вертикальное положение и устойчивость на ветру. Их растущие концы,
   покрытые корневыми волосками, всасывают из почвы воду с растворенными в
   ней минеральными солями. По более старым участкам корней, а затем по
   стволу и ветвям эти вещества попадают в листья, где используются клетками
   в различных химических реакциях, включая и процесс фотосинтеза. При этом
   основную массу воды корням приходится просто «качать по кругу», так как
   огромные ее количества теряются растением при транспирации. Корни также
   накапливают питательные вещества, которые требуются дереву в период покоя
   и обеспечивают взрывообразное возобновление его роста весной (в умеренной
   и бореальной зонах) или с наступлением сезона дождей (в сухих тропиках и
   субтропиках). Важны корни и для вегетативного размножения ряда деревьев,
   например вишен, осин, берез и сассафраса. Они образуют корневые отпрыски,
   т.е. дочерние побеги, которые могут развиться в крупные деревья,
   генетически идентичные материнскому (клон).

   Существует два основных типа корневых систем. У большинства дубов,
   некоторых сосен (например, жесткой и болотной) и многих других деревьев
   эта система стержневая: основание ствола переходит в крупный вертикальный
   корень, который постепенно сужается и ветвится подобно надземной части
   дерева. Этот главный корень обычно дополняется придаточными, горизонтально
   расходящимися от основания ствола. В случае мочковатой корневой системы,
   характерной, например, для ильмов, буков и кленов, у дерева имеются только
   такие горизонтальные корни, а главный среди них не заметен. Внутри каждого
   из этих типов наблюдаются многочисленные варианты. Кроме того, деревья
   одного и того же вида могут образовывать стержневую корневую систему на
   мощных плодородных почвах и мочковатую – на сырых или каменистых местах.

Система стебля.

   Эта система у дерева включает главный стебель, или ствол, и ветви,
   образующие в типичном случае крону, т.е. обширное, более или менее густое
   сплетение ветвей различного порядка, несущих листья, а также цветки или
   шишки.

   Стебель состоит из различных тканей: центр его занимает т.н. сердцевина, а
   вокруг нее располагаются концентрическими слоями древесина, камбий и кора.
   Молодой стебель образуется из верхушечной (первичной) меристемы – массы
   делящихся клеток на конце побега, обеспечивающих его рост в длину. После
   деления нижние из дочерних клеток дифференцируются в различные ткани, а
   верхние продолжают делиться. Следовательно, удлинение стебля идет только
   путем его верхушечного роста.

   СТРОЕНИЕ СТЕБЛЯ. а – Поперечный срез трехлетней ветки тюльпанного дерева,
   имеющей типичное для древесного стебля строение. Сердцевина окружена тремя
   слоями (годичными кольцами) древесины, камбием и корой, состоящей из
   флоэмы, первичной коры и пробки.б – Фрагмент среза, приведенного на рис.
   а, при большем увеличении; показан участок между двумя сердцевинными
   лучами. Можно видеть последнее годичное кольцо и группу клеток флоэмы.в – 
   Радиальный продольный срез древесины и флоэмы фрагмента, показанного на
   рис. б. Можно видеть похожие на лестницу торцевые стенки члеников сосудов
   и мелкие эллиптические поры в их боковых стенках. У члеников ситовидных
   трубок поры на торцевых стенках образуют т.н. ситовидные пластинки.

Сердцевина.

   Этот пронизывающий весь стебель центральный «стержень» представляет собой
   относительно мягкую ткань из довольно крупных, тонкостенных, слабо
   специализированных клеток, служащих для временного накопления питательных
   веществ. Поперечный срез сердцевины может быть круглым (ильм, ясень),
   треугольным (ольха) или пятиугольным – звездчатым (тополь, дуб). Обычно
   сердцевина отличается по цвету от окружающей древесины. На продольном
   срезе она бывает сплошной (однородной), перегородчатой (с поперечными
   уплотнениями, относительно регулярно распределенными в более мягкой массе
   клеток) или пористой (разделенной поперечными перегородками на камеры).
   Сердцевина образуется из верхушечной меристемы и ко вторичному утолщению
   не способна. У большинства деревьев ее клетки через несколько лет
   отмирают, однако их стенки могут сохраняться без изменений десятилетиями.

Камбий.

   Между древесиной и корой находится слой боковой меристемы – камбия –
   толщиной в одну клетку. Его клетки длинные, параллельные оси побега и
   прямоугольные в поперечном сечении. Они продольно делятся, образуя новые
   стенки параллельно поверхности стебля. Из двух дочерних клеток одна
   остается меристематической (способной к дальнейшему делению), а вторая
   дифференцируется: если она лежит кнаружи от камбия, то превращается в
   элемент флоэмы (луба), если с противоположной стороны – в клетку ксилемы
   (древесины). Таким образом происходит утолщение стебля, т.е. увеличение
   его диаметра. Поскольку этот рост отстает от удлинения и обеспечивается не
   первичной (верхушечной) меристемой, а камбием, он называется вторичным.

   Большинство делений клеток камбия приводит к формированию новых элементов
   древесины. По мере увеличения ее объема меристематическое кольцо не
   разрывается, поскольку некоторые клеточные деления в нем происходят по
   радиальным плоскостям; однако кора растягивается и в конечном итоге
   трескается (характер этого растрескивания часто относится к видовым
   признакам дерева).

Кольца прироста.

   Поскольку утолщение древесины целиком зависит от активности камбия, этот
   прирост идет концентрическими кольцами, причем в районах с сезонными
   колебаниями погодных условий – только в определенные времена года. У
   большинства видов клетки, образующиеся в начале и конце вегетационного
   периода, различаются по форме и размерам, поэтому на поперечном срезе
   стебля можно видеть чередующиеся слои ранней и поздней древесины – кольца
   прироста. Чаще всего они бывают годичными, но это не всегда так. Например,
   в крайне суровых местообитаниях новая древесина в исключительно холодные
   или засушливые годы вообще не образуется. И наоборот – деревья, пережившие
   в течение вегетационного периода непродолжительный стресс (отмирание
   листьев из-за поздних заморозков, объедание листьев гусеницами, короткую
   засуху), дают в год два кольца прироста, а иногда и больше. Во влажных
   тропиках камбий функционирует более или менее равномерно, поэтому четких
   колец на срезе ствола не видно.

   В областях с умеренным климатом клетки ранней (весенней) древесины
   относительно тонкостенные с широким просветом, а поздней (летней) – с
   более узким просветом и толстыми стенками. Между этими двумя типами может
   быть резкая разница или плавный переход в зависимости главным образом от
   породы дерева, хотя определенную роль играют также условия вегетационного
   периода. У кленов, тюльпанного и амбрового деревьев и ряда других пород
   весенняя древесина мало отличается от летней, и годичные кольца выражены
   слабо. У дубов, ясеней, сосен ладанной и голой эта разница, наоборот,
   очень резкая и годичные кольца обычно нетрудно подсчитать. Летняя
   древесина таких видов плотнее и прочнее, чем весенняя, она медленнее гниет
   и поэтому на поверхности их старых пней часто образует выступающие
   концентрические гребни.

   ДАТИРОВКА ДРЕВЕСИНЫ. На рисунке показано, как годичные кольца используются
   для установления возраста древесины. Этот метод основан на детальном
   сопоставлении, или перекрестной датировке, последовательностей широких и
   узких колец. Дерево в спилено в 1968. Следовательно, его последнее
   годичное кольцо (образец вў) сформировалось тогда же. Считая от него
   внутрь, можно определить возраст любого кольца этой древесины. Затем ее
   сравнивают с образцом бў, полученным из ствола, спиленного раньше, и
   выявляют идентичный по характеру чередования узких и широких колец
   интервал, например соответствующий периоду 1925–1932 точно датированной
   древесины. Теперь, ведя подсчет в обе стороны от него, можно определить
   год образования прочих колец дерева б. Аналогичным образом, путем
   сравнения с образцом бў, датируют все кольца еще более старого ствола а.
   Пользуясь этим методом, ученые устанавливают возраст не только пней, но и
   брусьев, досок и других деревянных изделий, обнаруживаемых при
   археологических раскопках. Кроме того, поскольку ширина кольца прироста
   зависит от количества осадков и других климатических факторов
   соответствующего года, на этой основе можно реконструировать климатическую
   историю конкретной местности.

Ксилема.

   Клетки древесины, или ксилемы, делятся на несколько типов. Один из них –
   длинные (длина часто в сто и более раз превышает ширину), веретеновидные
   (заостренные на концах) клетки, т.н. трахеиды. У лиственных пород их длина
   составляет в среднем 6 мм, у хвойных – 2–8 мм, однако их размер сильно
   варьирует в пределах одного вида и даже одного экземпляра дерева. У зрелых
   трахеид протопласт (живое содержимое) отмирает, и от клетки остаются
   только твердые стенки и центральная полость (просвет). Эти мертвые
   элементы придают прочность стеблю, а более молодые слои проводят вверх по
   нему воду с растворенными в ней минеральными веществами. Из одной трахеиды
   в другую раствор поступает через круглые поры – места истончения клеточной
   оболочки. Другой тип клеток ксилемы – клетки волокон, сходные с
   трахеидами, но стенка их намного толще и без пор, а просвет уже. Они в
   основном придают стеблю прочность.

   Клетки, называемые члениками сосудов, присутствуют только в древесине
   покрытосеменных. Как и трахеиды, они в зрелом состоянии мертвые, но по
   диаметру больше, относительно тонкостенные и на концах перфорированные,
   т.е. открытые. Сотни таких члеников часто соединяются торцами, образуя
   непрерывные трубки – многометровые сосуды. Если просвет ранних (весенних)
   сосудов значительно больше, чем поздних (летних), то древесина называется
   кольцепоровой, а если эти просветы примерно равны – рассеяннопоровой.
   Первая наблюдается, например, у дуба белого, а вторая – у березы желтой.
   По сосудам вода с растворенными в ней веществами перемещается вверх
   быстрее, чем по трахеидам.

   Клетки паренхимы древесины в отличие от трахеид, члеников сосудов и
   волокон в зрелом состоянии живые, невытянутые, относительно тонкостенные,
   но, как правило, с порами. Они участвуют в транспорте и запасании
   питательных веществ. Из живых клеток состоят узкие тяжи – т.н.
   сердцевинные лучи, радиально пронизывающие ксилему. У хвойных пород эти
   лучи толщиной только в одну клетку, а у лиственных – в одну, две и более.
   По ним осуществляется радиальный транспорт. У всех лиственных и некоторых
   хвойных деревьев в древесине присутствуют и осевые паренхимные тяжи –
   осевая паренхима. У многих хвойных в ксилеме также проходят смоляные ходы
   – непрерывные трубки, возникающие при расхождении секреторных клеток,
   становящихся их стенками. Эти клетки выделяют смолу, которая быстро
   запечатывает раны на дереве, обездвиживает и убивает повреждающих
   древесину насекомых и, возможно, выполняет другие защитные функции.

   Живые клетки, участвующие в транспорте и накоплении питательных веществ,
   находятся только в самых молодых слоях древесины, расположенных ближе
   всего к камбию. В стволе и крупных ветвях эта ее часть называется
   заболонью. У каштана и белой акации заболонь состоит всего из нескольких
   годичных колец и достигает в толщину не более 13 мм, однако у кленов,
   ясеней, карий и некоторых сосен она бывает толщиной до 15 см.

   По мере старения древесины у большинства видов паренхимные клетки
   прорастают сквозь поры сосудов и трахеид, образуя в них пробки, или тиллы,
   которые препятствуют движению воды. С годами здесь также накапливаются
   камеди, смолы, минеральные соли, танины и другие вещества. У большинства
   видов они окрашивают внутреннюю – ядровую – древесину в темный цвет и
   повышают ее устойчивость к гниению. Такой устойчивостью славятся,
   например, болотный кипарис, можжевельник виргинский и белая акация, из
   которых получаются высококачественные сваи и столбы. Кроме того, ядровая
   древесина можжевельника содержит вещества, отпугивающие насекомых, и
   некоторые его виды широко используются для изготовления комодов и шкафов,
   в которых не заводится моль. У большинства елей, пихт, тсуг, тополей,
   конских каштанов и лип ядровая древесина почти не отличается по цвету от
   заболони.

Флоэма.

   Вторая образуемая камбием проводящая ткань – флоэма, или луб, которую
   называют также внутренней корой. Она состоит главным образом из ситовидных
   трубок, по которым растворенные питательные вещества движутся по стеблю
   вниз. Клетки (членики) ситовидных трубок удлиненные и тонкостенные. Их
   стенки выстилает слой живой протоплазмы, окружающий крупную центральную
   вакуоль. На концах стенки перфорированы или отсутствуют, и в этих местах
   протопласты члеников ситовидных трубок соединяются друг с другом. Сотни
   таких члеников, смыкаясь торцами, образуют непрерывные тяжи – ситовидные
   трубки, тянущиеся от концов корней до листьев. У лиственных пород к
   ситовидным трубкам примыкают клетки-спутники; протопласты двух этих
   элементов связаны друг с другом через поры в боковых стенках. Считается,
   что клетки-спутники каким-то образом способствуют транспорту веществ по
   флоэме. Кроме того, во флоэме находятся волокна, придающие ткани
   прочность, и паренхима, в которой накапливаются питательные вещества. Если
   окольцевать дерево, т.е. надрезать его кору по кругу до самой древесины,
   нисходящий флоэмный транспорт органических веществ прекратится, корни
   начнут голодать и растение вскоре погибнет.

Кора.

   Когда клетки флоэмы отмирают, они сплющиваются нарастающей в толщину
   древесиной и входят в состав защитной наружной коры. Однако последняя
   утолщается в основном за счет третьего типа меристемы – пробкового камбия,
   или феллогена. Он формируется внутри живой флоэмы либо сплошным
   цилиндрическим слоем, либо – у большинства деревьев – отдельными
   участками. В ходе делений феллогена снаружи от него откладываются слои
   мертвой водонепроницаемой пробки, а в противоположную сторону – живая
   ткань, называемая феллодермой. Неравномерное образование пробки в
   сочетании с особенностями растрескивания коры по мере ее растяжения
   приводит к сложному и разнообразному рельефу поверхности ствола и старых
   ветвей.

   Кора с возрастом дерева утолщается, а ее наружные слои непрерывно
   отслаиваются. В результате пробковый камбий рано или поздно оказывается
   вблизи поверхности и отмирает, а на смену ему во внутренней коре
   закладывается новый. Иногда на различной глубине в коре одновременно
   функционируют два или несколько его слоев. Поскольку наружная кора
   постоянно отслаивается, а нарастает с помощью пробкового камбия
   относительно медленно, по массе и объему она составляет лишь небольшую
   часть ствола дерева. В стволах большинства деревьев ее толщина редко
   превышает 5 см, хотя у основания секвой и секвойядендронов она может
   достигать и 60 см.

   Чечевички – это отверстия в коре, через которые происходит газообмен
   тканей стебля с атмосферой. Через них внутрь поступает необходимый для
   клеточного дыхания кислород, а наружу выделяется образующийся в ходе этого
   процесса углекислый газ. На молодых участках стебля чечевички выглядят
   округлыми или удлиненными бугорками и обычно развиваются там, где в
   эпидермисе находились устьица. У большинства видов они по мере старения и
   утолщения коры закупориваются и отваливаются вместе с ее наружными слоями,
   но у некоторых деревьев, например вишен, остаются заметными в течение
   многих лет.

   Рассмотренное выше концентрическое расположение тканей стебля характерно
   для хвойных пород и для двудольных покрытосеменных. У однодольных
   покрытосеменных, например у пальм, юкк и бамбуков, картина иная. Клетки
   древесины и флоэмы у них собраны в продольные тяжи – т.н. сосудистые
   пучки, разбросанные в толще стебля и окруженные основной паренхимой,
   сходной с той, что образует сердцевину двудольных. Утолщение стебля
   происходит за счет медленно функционирующей боковой меристемы,
   развивающейся у юкк и пальм из клеток основной паренхимы. Стволы
   однодольных деревьев утолщаются слабо и от основания к вершине почти не
   сужаются.

Листья.

   У листопадных пород каждый лист живет всего несколько месяцев, а у
   вечнозеленых – не более 14 лет. Главная его функция – фотосинтез, т.е.
   образование питательных веществ из диоксида углерода и воды. Этот процесс
   требует солнечного света, поэтому строение кроны дерева призвано
   обеспечить его эффективное улавливание. Например, у сахарного клена
   среднего размера на открытом месте проекция кроны на землю занимает
   примерно 0,004 га, а общая площадь поверхности листвы может достигать 0,12
   га, т.е. бывает в 30 раз больше. Обычно на каждый гектар леса приходится
   3–5 га освещаемой солнцем листовой поверхности. См. также ЛИСТ;
   ФОТОСИНТЕЗ.

Репродуктивные структуры.

   Все современные деревья, за исключением древовидных папоротников,
   размножаются семенами, которые образуются в цветках или шишках. Цветки
   сходны с шишками не только по функции, но и по основному строению. И те и
   другие формируются обычно из первичной меристемы стебля и образуют пыльцу
   и семяпочки, в которых развиваются соответственно спермии и яйцеклетки,
   т.е. мужские и женские половые клетки. После оплодотворения яйцеклетки
   спермием она дает начало семени с зародышем растения внутри. Основное
   различие между шишками и цветками заключается в том, что семена у первых
   «голые», т.е. не защищены снаружи дополнительными структурами, а у вторых
   созревают внутри завязи.

Шишки.

   Растения, образующие шишки, по указанной выше причине называются
   голосеменными. Их семяпочки находятся на поверхности специализированных
   листьев – мегаспорофиллов. У древних голосеменных, т.н. семенных
   папоротников, известных только по ископаемым остаткам, мегаспорофиллы
   практически не отличались от прочих листьев. У современных же
   представителей этой группы и они, и образующие пыльцу микроспорофиллы
   мелкие, видоизменены в чешуи и в большинстве случаев собраны плотными
   спиралями на укороченных побегах – шишках, или стробилах. Семяпочки
   развиваются на поверхности семенных чешуй в женских шишках, а пыльца – в
   особых мужских шишках, которые мельче женских и не столь сильно
   одревесневают. Самые крупные женские шишки – у сосны Ламберта, их длина
   достигает 58 см; самые мелкие – у некоторых можжевельников – диаметром ок.
   0,3 см. В большинстве случаев мужские и женские шишки растут на одном и
   том же дереве. См. также СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ.

Цветки.

   У цветковых, или покрытосеменных, растений мегаспорофиллы называются
   плодолистиками. Один или несколько сросшихся плодолистиков образуют
   замкнутую полую структуру, называемую пестиком, в нижней части которой –
   завязи – находятся семяпочки. Там же они созревают в семена. Пестики и
   образующие пыльцу тычинки могут находиться в одном цветке, как у
   тюльпанного дерева, кленов и вишен, в разных цветках на одном дереве, как
   у дубов, карий и берез (однодомные виды), или же могут вообще
   формироваться на разных – женских и мужских – деревьях, как у ив и тополей
   (двудомные виды).

   В состав цветка кроме тычинок и пестиков могут входить вспомогательные
   структуры, обычно чашелистики и лепестки. Различия формы и расположения
   частей цветка дают практически неисчерпаемое богатство вариантов строения
   и являются основными признаками, используемыми для классификации
   покрытосеменных растений. Разнообразия прибавляют и особенности
   образования цветков на дереве – поодиночке или плотными группами, т.е.
   соцветиями. Так, магнолии ценятся озеленителями за очень крупные одиночные
   цветки, часто с ярко окрашенными лепестками. У кельрейтерии метельчатой,
   белой акации и оксидендрума древовидного мелкие цветки собраны в
   живописные кисти. Цветкам шелковой акации придают особую красоту их
   длинные ярко окрашенные тычинки. В то же время цветки многих деревьев,
   особенно ветроопыляемых, настолько невзрачны, что большинство людей их
   вообще не замечает. К таким видам относятся, например, дубы, ясени,
   грецкие орехи, ильмы.

Плоды.

   У деревьев, принадлежащих к покрытосеменным, как и у прочих растений этой
   группы, плод представляет собой зрелую завязь с семенами, иногда
   срастающуюся с другими структурами. Называть плодами женские шишки
   голосеменных с точки зрения ботаники неверно.

   По форме, строению и размерам плоды весьма разнообразны. Самый крупный
   плод у сейшельской пальмы; он напоминает двулопастной кокосовый орех,
   весит до 18 кг и содержит, вероятно, самое большое в мире семя.

   У одних деревьев плоды сухие и твердые, у других – мягкие и сочные. У
   ильмов, ясеней и айланта плоды называются крылатками. Они сухие, одно- или
   двусемянные и снабжены крыловидным выростом. У кленов плоды примерно такие
   же, но обычно с двумя крылышками; они называются двукрылатками. У
   тюльпанного дерева 80–100 крылаток, перед тем как разлететься, сидят тесно
   прижатыми друг к другу на центральной оси, что в целом внешне весьма
   напоминает шишку.

   К другим сухим плодам относятся орехи, бобы и коробочки. У орехов стенка
   завязи, созревая, одревесневает и превращается в твердую скорлупу.
   Некоторые орехи на дереве частично или полностью окружены как бы чехлом из
   видоизмененных листьев или разросшихся тканей стебля – плюской (например,
   у лещины, дуба), которая бывает колючей, как у каштана или бука. Бобы при
   созревании вскрываются по шву. Этот тип плода свойствен, например, акации,
   иудиному дереву и рожковому дереву. У конских каштанов плоды, вопреки
   распространенному мнению, не орехи, а коробочки, внутри которых находятся
   похожие на орехи семена. Коробочка – также вскрывающийся плод. Среди
   известных деревьев он свойствен, например, тополям и ивам.

   К мясистым относятся такие типы плода, как яблоко (яблоня, груша, рябина и
   т.д.) и ягода (финиковая пальма, хурма и т.д.). Плоды цитрусовых –
   гесперидии, или померанцы, – представляют собой модифицированную ягоду с
   кожистой оболочкой, содержащей множество эфирномасличных желез, и сочными
   волосками внутри. Костянка, свойственная вишне, сливе, персику, оливе и
   т.д., – это обычно сочный плод, внутренняя часть которого превращена в
   деревянистую косточку, окружающую семя. Впрочем, костянки бывают и сухими,
   например у миндаля, грецкого ореха и кокосовой пальмы: их плоды перед
   продажей принято очищать от наружных покровов, оставляя только косточку,
   поэтому в просторечии они называются орехами, что с точки зрения ботаники
   неправильно. Кокосовое молоко – это не до конца созревший (достигший
   молочной спелости) эндосперм семени, в котором сосредоточены его
   питательные вещества.

   В некоторых случаях несколько завязей одного цветка, созревая, не
   разделяются, а образуют т.н. сборный плод, например у магнолий.
   Совокупность зрелых плодов одного соцветия называют соплодием. Соплодия
   характерны, например, для шелковиц (тутовников), маклюр и хлебного дерева.

Семена.

   Семена у деревьев, как и у прочих семенных растений, распространяются
   ветром, животными, водой. Распространение может облегчаться структурными
   приспособлениями самих семян или плодов. У кленов, ильмов, тюльпанного
   дерева, берез, ясеней, катальпы и многих хвойных летучесть семян
   увеличивают крыловидные выросты, а у ив и тополей – пучки волосков.
   Кокосовые «орехи» и плоды клекачек могут проплывать большие расстояния.

   Мясистые плоды с высокой питательной ценностью привлекают животных,
   которые растаскивают их во все стороны от материнских растений, а иногда и
   закапывают про запас. При этом неизбежные «потери при транспортировке и
   хранении» дают начало всходам. Семена многих съеденных плодов проходят
   через пищеварительный тракт животных неповрежденными и в результате
   попадают в почву вместе с порцией удобрений.

РАЗМНОЖЕНИЕ ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   Обычно деревья размножаются семенами, но в ряде случаев предпочтительным
   оказывается вегетативное размножение, например черенками, отводками и
   прививками. Этот способ позволяет воспроизводить бессемянные деревья (в
   частности, пупочные апельсины) и гибриды, не способные размножаться
   половым путем, а также получать большое количество экземпляров тех форм,
   которые образуют мало жизнеспособных семян. При вегетативном размножении
   взрослые плодоносящие деревья можно получать быстрее, чем из всходов.
   Прививка дает возможность сочетать неприхотливость корневых систем одних
   деревьев с ценными качествами плодов других сортов и даже видов, что
   позволяет получать урожай в более суровых условиях, а также бороться с
   преследующими данную культуру корневыми вредителями и паразитами.
   Например, слива, привитая на персик, хорошо плодоносит на песчаных почвах,
   где она сама по себе скорее всего погибла бы, а европейский виноград,
   привитый на американскую лозу, растет лучше, поскольку последняя устойчива
   к повреждающей корни европейской филлоксере.

Черенкование.

   Черенки – это отрезки побегов, нижний конец которых помещают во влажную
   почву или воду для укоренения. У ив, тополя пирамидального, белой акации,
   кизила, ликвидамбара, тюльпанного дерева, гинкго, кедра и многих других
   деревьев придаточные корни образуются очень легко и черенки быстро
   превращаются в растения, способные существовать самостоятельно. В других
   случаях корнеобразование стимулируют с помощью растительных гормонов
   (фитогормонов), в частности индолилуксусной, индолилпропионовой,
   индолилмасляной и нафтилуксусной кислот. Свежие черенки, еще не
   образовавшие корней, очень чувствительны к высыханию, поэтому для снижения
   потерь воды у них удаляют часть листьев и применяют защитные покрытия или
   опрыскивание водным аэрозолем.

Размножение отводками

   сходно с черенкованием, но дочерний стебель не отделяют от материнского до
   укоренения, а обычно сначала пригибают к земле, пришпиливают и окучивают.
   В узлах такого отводка развиваются придаточные корни и вертикальные
   побеги, способные к самостоятельному существованию. Таким способом
   размножают, например, магнолии и кизил, а естественное образование
   отводков наблюдается у елей, пихт, туй, тсуг, сосны обыкновенной и многих
   других хвойных.

Прививка (трансплантация).

   При этом способе свежесрезанный черенок (привой) прижимают местом среза к
   надрезу на укорененном растении (подвое) и прочно закрепляют в таком
   положении. Их ткани срастаются, и вся система начинает функционировать как
   единое целое. Привой обычно получают от таксона с ценными цветками,
   плодами или другими надземными органами, а подвоем служит близкий таксон,
   у которого они менее ценные, но корневая система устойчивее или мощнее.
   Как правило, прививки используют для рутинного размножения плодовых или
   декоративных деревьев, но иногда и специально для получения ботанических
   курьезов – экземпляров, на ветвях которых можно наблюдать более 100
   различных типов листвы, цветков и плодов.

   Чтобы обеспечить успех прививки, следует соблюдать ряд условий. Привой
   должен только начинать выходить из состояния покоя, т.е. лучшее время для
   этой операции – весна. Чтобы защитить место соединения привоя с подвоем от
   высыхания и болезнетворных организмов, его обмазывают садовым варом.
   Необходимо также привести в соприкосновение камбиальные слои привоя и
   подвоя. Эти слои непосредственно не срастаются. Сначала на двух стеблях
   образуется раневая ткань, или каллус, которая затем дифференцируется на
   клетки ксилемы, флоэмы и наружной коры, образующие мостик между
   соответствующими тканями привоя и подвоя.

   Наиболее распространенные способы прививки – в расщеп и почкой, или
   глазком (окулировка). В первом случае обычно два клинообразно заостренных
   тонких привоя вставляют в щель, вырезанную в пеньке толстого подвоя так,
   чтобы они соприкасались с его камбиальной зоной. При окулировке привой
   состоит из почки с окружающим ее кусочком коры. В коре подвоя делают
   T-образный надрез, в него вставляют привой, плотно приматывают и
   замазывают садовым варом. Прививку глазком лучше всего проводить в конце
   лета или начале осени – непосредственно перед тем, как кора подвоя
   отвердеет на зиму. Этот метод, наиболее распространенный при размножении
   вишен, персиков и слив, позволяет получить от одного стебля сразу много
   привоев.

   Еще один способ прививки – аблактировка, или прививка сближением. Побеги
   двух растущих рядом деревьев надрезают, соединяют местами срезов,
   обвязывают и обмазывают. Когда они срастутся, привой отделяют от его
   корня, а подвой обрезают выше места прививки. Кстати говоря, похожее
   срастание ветвей наблюдается у деревьев и в природе.

   ПРИВИВКА В РАСЩЕП. Обычно используются два привоя, диаметр которых
   значительно меньше, чем у подвоя. Один конец у них заостряют плоским
   клином и вставляют в щель, сделанную на пеньке подвоя, ближе к двум ее
   краям – там, где находится камбиальная зона. Затем открытые места срезов
   обмазывают садовым варом, чтобы защитить живые ткани от
   инфекции.ОКУЛИРОВКА. При окулировке, или прививке глазком, привой состоит
   из «щитка», т.е.почки («глазка») с узкой полоской окружающей ее наружной
   коры и живой флоэмы. Подвой – толстую ветку – надрезают T-образно, и в эту
   щель вставляют привой. Затем его прижимают снаружи корой подвоя,
   обматывают место прививки лентой или мягкой веревкой и замазывают садовым
   варом.

ВРЕДИТЕЛИ И БОЛЕЗНИ ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   Различными тканями дерева питаются многие членистоногие. Некоторые из них
   портят внешний вид дерева, не причиняя ему существенного вреда, другие же
   могут нанести ему серьезный ущерб и даже погубить. Можно выделить две
   основные группы таких организмов. Первичные вредители нападают на здоровые
   деревья, а вторичные – на ослабленные или погибающие. Можно также выделить
   два главных класса болезней деревьев – паразитарные, т.е. вызываемые
   живыми организмами, и непаразитарные, возникающие из-за неблагоприятных
   физико-химических (абиотических) факторов среды.

Первичные вредители.

   Многие виды жуков и бабочек поражают стволы здоровых деревьев. Обычно
   взрослая самка откладывает в трещины коры яйца, а из них вылупляются
   личинки, которые прогрызают в стволе дерева ходы и питаются сначала лубом
   и камбием, а позже могут проникать в заболонь и даже в ядровую древесину.
   Пример – дровосек белой акации. Взрослый жук – черный с зигзагообразными
   желтыми полосами – ест пыльцу золотарника и других трав, а его личинки
   прогрызают ходы в стволах деревьев.

   Листья дерева служат кормом взрослым жукам и их личинкам, гусеницам
   бабочек, личинкам пилильщиков, муравьям, тлям, отдельным видам почти всех
   прочих групп насекомых, а также клещам. Некоторые виды, например хрущик
   японский и гусеницы шелкопряда непарного, объедают листья снаружи; другие,
   в частности малый минирующий березовый пилильщик, прокладывают ходы в их
   мягких внутренних тканях. Тли, червецы, цикадки, хермесы и паутинные
   клещики сосут сок из листовых жилок.

   Среди наиболее интересных и наименее опасных насекомых, поражающих
   здоровые деревья, заслуживают упоминания галлообразователи. В основном это
   крошечные перепончатокрылые и двукрылые, хотя галлы, т.е. патологические
   разрастания растительных тканей, образуют также многие тли и некоторые
   клещи. Одни из самых крупных галлов – т.н. чернильные орешки на дубе.

   Некоторые насекомые служат переносчиками болезней деревьев. Например,
   заболонник струйчатый переносит споры гриба, вызывающего голландскую
   болезнь ильмовых, при которой нарушается водопроводящая функция ксилемы.
   Листья на зараженных ветвях вянут и отмирают, а в конечном итоге гибнет
   все дерево.

Вторичные вредители.

   Деревья, ослабленные механическим повреждением, пожаром, болезнью, плохим
   питанием, засухой и другими неблагоприятными факторами, особенно
   чувствительны к поражению насекомыми, поедающими их луб, камбий и
   древесину. Мелкие кучки или столбики белых пылевидных отходов («буровой
   муки»), выступающие из-под коры, – признак работы короедов. Эти жуки
   нападают только на умирающие деревья, поэтому бороться с ними обычно
   бессмысленно. Многие их виды проделывают в коре ходы диаметром с дробинку.
   Они питаются лубом и камбием. Часто результатом их деятельности
   оказывается целая сложная сеть ходов, которую можно видеть, сняв
   пораженный участок коры с дерева. Если эти ходы опояшут ствол кольцом,
   лишив его тем самым на этом отрезке луба и камбия, то флоэмное питание
   корня прекратится, а ксилема в этом месте перестанет обновляться. В
   результате дерево погибнет или почти сразу из-за того, что нарушится
   водоснабжение кроны, или медленнее из-за прекращения притока питательных
   веществ от листьев к корням.

Меры борьбы с вредителями.

   Лучшая мера защиты от вредителей – поддержание здорового состояния
   деревьев. Повреждений следует избегать или быстро устранять их, при
   подозрении на недостаток питательных веществ вносить в почву удобрения, в
   сухие периоды производить полив. Однако в некоторых случаях таких мер
   оказывается недостаточно.

   В последние десятилетия появилось множество химических инсектицидов,
   которые могут предупреждать нападение вредителей и убивать их. Однако эти
   вещества действуют и на полезных насекомых, а во многих случаях также на
   птиц, млекопитающих и самого человека, поэтому применять их надо с большой
   осторожностью, точно следуя инструкциям. Умирающие деревья, пораженные
   короедами, необходимо вырубать и сжигать или обрабатывать специальными
   препаратами, например ортодихлорбензолом в смеси 1:6 с мазутом. Если не
   уничтожить короедов, они могут настолько размножиться, что пострадают и
   растущие рядом здоровые деревья.

Непаразитарные болезни.

   Эти заболевания – неинфекционные, т.е. незаразные, хотя многие деревья
   страдают от одних и тех же абиотических факторов. Дефицит влаги,
   недостаток кислорода для корней, солнечные ожоги, промерзание и
   обморожения, избыток соли, несбалансированное питание и отравление
   загрязняющими веществами – все это неблагоприятно сказывается на состоянии
   деревьев и может привести к их гибели.

Паразитарные болезни.

   Основными болезнетворными агентами, или патогенами, поражающими деревья,
   являются грибы, хотя большой вред им наносят также вирусы и бактерии.
   Обитающие в почве крошечные черви нематоды, проникающие в корни деревьев,
   особенно опасны для плодовых культур. На деревьях поселяются и
   паразитические семенные растения, например омела, однако вред от них
   обычно невелик. Поскольку паразиты могут распространяться от больного
   дерева к здоровому, вызываемые ими болезни называют инфекционными, т.е.
   заразными.

Грибы.

   Грибы не способны к фотосинтезу, поэтому питаются органическими остатками
   (сапрофиты) или паразитируют на живых организмах. Хотя большинство грибов
   для деревьев безвредны, а многие даже полезны, тысячи видов становятся
   причиной болезней (микозов) разной тяжести, в том числе и таких, которые
   заканчиваются гибелью дерева. Эти патогены могут поражать практически
   любую часть дерева, вызывая, например, завядание кроны, пятнистость
   листьев, рак стебля, гниль древесины и гниль плодов, галлообразование и
   корневые гнили. Если поражаются листья или цветки, то дерево может просто
   ослабнуть или дать плохой урожай, но сильное поражение камбия, флоэмы,
   древесины или корней чревато гибелью всего растения.

Вирусы

   отличаются крайне высокой инфекционностью и передаются от одного растения
   к другому большей частью с помощью насекомых-переносчиков.

   Известно не так много вирусных болезней (вирозов) деревьев, однако не
   исключено, что именно вирусы – причина различных их аномалий, этиология
   которых еще не выяснена. Самое опасное вирусное заболевание деревьев в
   Северной Америке – некроз флоэмы ильмовых. Луб пораженных ильмов
   (американского и крылаточерешкового) становится желтовато-бурым, листья
   внезапно желтеют и вянут. Гибель дерева может наступить уже через
   несколько недель после появления первых симптомов болезни или же через
   год–два и более. Переносят эту болезнь мелкие цикадки.

Бактерии

   встречаются практически в любой среде. Многие из них – сапрофиты, полезные
   тем, что разлагают мертвые листья, ветви, плоды и другие органические
   остатки, но известны и некоторые бактериальные болезни (бактериозы)
   деревьев. В качестве примера можно привести бактериальный ожог плодовых
   деревьев, поражающий груши, яблони и близкие к ним культуры, а также
   бактериальный некроз древовидного кактуса карнегии гигантской (сагуаро).

ПОСАДКА ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   При выборе деревьев для посадки нужно принимать во внимание особенности
   породы и места, где деревьям предстоит расти, т.е. климат, рельеф, почву и
   т.п. Желательно опираться на два источника информации – природную
   древесную флору (дендрофлору) данной области и, особенно в случае
   экзотических таксонов, карты зон адаптации растений, определяющие области,
   где температуры позволяют выращивать те или иные виды. Влажность и
   почвенные условия при этом не учитываются, т.к. их можно изменить
   искусственно – путем осушения, орошения, удобрения и т.п. Впрочем,
   региональные температурные ограничения также до определенной степени
   преодолимы, например путем посадки теплолюбивых видов на хорошо
   прогреваемых южных склонах или укрывания на зиму чувствительных к холоду
   экземпляров.

   Важно правильно выбрать время посадки. В любом случае желательно
   производить ее тогда, когда саженцы находятся в состоянии покоя. В
   северных областях это лучше делать весной, чтобы дерево успело окрепнуть
   до зимних холодов, в более теплых районах – весной или осенью.

   При пересадке от 20 до 80% корневой системы дерева теряется, в том числе

   основная масса молодых активных корней, поэтому способность растения
   всасывать из почвы воду с минеральными солями сильно снижается. Чтобы
   компенсировать эту потерю, широколиственные саженцы рекомендуется
   обрезать, пропорционально уменьшая поверхность испаряющих влагу стеблей и
   листьев. Надземные части хвойных пород лучше сохраняют влагу, поэтому в
   обрезке, как правило, не нуждаются.

   При посадке желательно, чтобы корни саженца не деформировались. Если грунт
   слишком плотный или, наоборот, чересчур рыхлый, следует выкопать лунку
   вдвое шире и глубже, чем корневая система, и заполнить ее более подходящим
   субстратом. Засыпая лунку вокруг дерева, надо уплотнять землю, пока до
   поверхности не останется 5–8 см, а после этого тщательно полить
   углубление, чтобы как следует увлажнить почву и обеспечить ее лучший
   контакт с корнями. Когда засыпка лунки окончена, земля вокруг ствола
   должна быть на 3–5 см выше исходного уровня: она будет постепенно оседать,
   заполняя оставшиеся между корнями пустоты.

   Высаженным в ветренных местах деревьям высотой более 2 м на первых порах
   нужна опора. Если диаметр их ствола меньше 5 см, достаточно одного
   колышка, поднимающегося на 60 см выше уровня самой нижней ветви. Если
   дерево толще, его привязывают к двум-трем кольям или укрепляют на
   трех-четырех проволочных растяжках.

ОЗЕЛЕНЕНИЕ ГОРОДОВ

   Деревья – один из важнейших элементов городского ландшафта. Зеленые
   насаждения выполняют эстетическую функцию, улучшают микроклимат,
   рассеивают слишком яркий свет, служат фильтром для пыли и других
   загрязнителей воздуха.

   К деревьям, используемым для озеленения городов, предъявляется ряд
   специфических требований. Они должны иметь не только эстетически
   выигрышную, но и достаточно прогнозируемую или легко контролируемую форму
   роста, расти быстрее, жить дольше, быть как можно более устойчивыми к
   болезням, вредителям, загрязнению и физическим повреждениям. Желательно,
   чтобы у листопадных деревьев цветки, плоды и осенняя окраска листьев были
   привлекательными. Весьма нежелательны плохой запах от каких-либо частей
   дерева, присутствие в них химических веществ, угнетающих рост других
   видов, а также корневая система, склонная взламывать снизу уличное
   покрытие и давать отпрыски вдалеке от материнского ствола. Следует также
   учитывать влияние искусственного освещения (особенно на т.н.
   короткодневные виды) и дополнительных источников тепла. Отмечено,
   например, что листья и цветки у деревьев в городе появляются раньше, чем у
   тех же видов в окружающей сельской местности.

   Выбор пород деревьев, высаживаемых в городах, естественно, зависит от
   конкретных географических условий. В пригородах и парках хорошо себя
   чувствуют многие виды местной дендрофлоры, в том числе вечнозеленые, но
   последние обычно плохо растут на оживленных улицах, поскольку их медленно
   обновляемая листва не приспособлена к высокому уровню атмосферного
   загрязнения. В то же время некоторые деревья особенно устойчивы к
   загрязнению, а также относительно мало страдают от болезней и вредителей,
   поэтому их охотнее всего используют для городского озеленения.

   Раньше широко практиковалось озеленение конкретной улицы единственной
   породой дерева, экземпляры которого располагались на более или менее
   одинаковых расстояниях друг от друга. С эстетической точки зрения это,
   может быть, и оправданно, однако такие одновидовые насаждения особенно
   чувствительны не только к вредителям и инфекционным болезням, но и к
   неблагоприятным погодным условиям, например засухе. Поэтому желательно
   использовать для озеленения даже небольших площадей несколько сочетающихся
   по форме и размеру древесных пород.

                                 Гимн деревьям

   22.04.2022

   Деревья защищают людей от непредсказуемых явлений природы, от мороза и
   зноя, от наводнений и засухи. Не будь деревьев, род людской не смог бы
   выжить: у нас не было бы инструментов, домов, заборов, мостов, книг и
   многого другого. В своей книге «Деревья» немецкий натуралист Андреас Хазе
   рассказывает о самых важных для человеческой истории и культуры видах
   деревьев, о применении древесины и других даров деревьев в хозяйственной
   деятельности человека, об этимологии некоторых названий, а также о
   верованиях, связанных с деревьями. Какие деревья могут прожить 1000 лет?
   Из какой древесины сделать флейту, чтобы она звучала мягко и нежно? Какие
   деревья помогали лекарям, птицеловам, рыбакам, художникам и даже самому
   Иоганну Гутенбергу? Читайте самые интересные факты из книги «Деревья» в
   нашем материале. 

Сосны могут жить 1000 лет и заселить Землю после пожара

   Сосна наряду с пихтой принадлежит к самым высоким деревьям Европы. Ствол
   диаметром более метра — в случае сосны не редкость. Иголки ее хвои длиной
   до 8 сантиметров синевато-зеленые, гибкие, но на удивление острые. Они
   остаются на ветке от 2 до 4 лет, регулярно обновляясь.

   Сосна развила глубокий и крепкий стержневой корень, с помощью которого
   может укрепиться в земле более прочно, чем другие деревья. Он проникает в
   глубину земли до 8 метров, а боковые корни могут простираться на
   расстояние до 16 метров. Ветровал редок, при условии, что сосны растут на
   подходящей почве и для них достаточно места. В Германии часто сажают
   сосны, не соблюдая этих условий, в местностях, где дерево никогда не стало
   бы расти само.

   По упомянутым причинам указываемый в специальной литературе максимальный
   возраст, который может достигать сосна в наших широтах, составляет
   преимущественно от 200 до 300 лет. В действительности же здоровая,
   выросшая в естественных условиях сосна способна доживать до 1000 лет.

   Именно сосновые леса сильнее всего подвержены угрозе пожаров: за счет
   высокого содержания смолы в дереве пламя с легкостью распространяется по
   кронам. От удара молнии или самовоспламенения в естественном лесу снова и
   снова случаются пожары, но, поскольку деревья в них растут на достаточно
   безопасном расстоянии друг от друга, такие возгорания не причиняют
   большого вреда лесонасаждению и даже жизненно необходимы для возобновления
   леса. Только в созданных человеком лесах хозяйственного назначения, где у
   плотно посаженных деревьев нет возможности спастись, свирепствуют
   действительно опустошающие лесные пожары.

   Удивительно, но семенные шишки некоторых видов сосны в США раскрываются
   только в огне, при температуре около 100 °C. Такие сосны смогут заселить
   землю после пожара.

Из бузины делали лекарства и красители

   Бузина — одно из самых полезных лекарственных растений, это объясняет,
   почему у германцев и кельтов с древних времен было к ней особое отношение.
   Каждая отдельная часть этого растения может использоваться в лечебных
   целях. Ни одно другое дерево или кустарник так эффективно не избавляли от
   боли. Считалось, например, что если бузинной щепкой уколоть десну до
   крови, то она вберет в себя всю зубную боль. Существовали методы лечения
   фурункулов и нарывов. В наши дни в натуропатии широко применяются отвары
   из цветков бузины и ванны с настоем из высушенных цветков.

   В немецком названии бузины — Holunder — прослеживается связь с именем
   древнегерманской богини брака и деторождения Гольды, которая
   покровительствовала земледелию и домоводству, прежде всего ткачеству.
   Издавна бузину использовали для окрашивания тканей, а также волос и кожи.
   Большим спросом пользуется красящая способность листьев. Добавление уксуса
   в отвар листьев, подвергшихся долгому кипячению, обеспечивает отбеливание
   текстиля. Кожица ягоды бузины, в свою очередь, содержит до 60 %
   натурального темно-фиолетового красителя — самбуцианина. Кора бузины также
   ценилась как красящее вещество — ее отвар с добавлением уксуса окрашивает
   текстиль в черный цвет. 

Рябина помогала птицеловам

   Рябина — растение неприметное, хотя и относится к деревьям, которые
   распускают листья довольно рано. Из-за перистых листьев ее легко
   перепутать с молодым ясенем. Только когда на рябине появляются характерные
   плоды, ее красота вспыхивает сама собой, показывая миру истинное лицо
   этого дерева. 

   Так как ягоды рябины — любимое лакомство птиц, птицеловы столетиями
   использовали их как приманку в хитроумных ловушках. Крестьянам охота на
   крупную дичь была запрещена, и птицы служили им важным дополнительным
   источником питания. Sorbus aucuparia, ботаническое название рябины
   обыкновенной, как раз указывает на это, поскольку эпитет aucuparia
   происходит от латинского aves capere, что означает не что иное, как
   «ловить птиц». 

Тополь — дерево художников и рыбаков

   Тополь черный входит в список деревьев, находящихся под угрозой. Гораздо
   чаще встречаются другие виды рода Populus (тополь серебристый, осина
   обыкновенная), а также различные гибриды. Все представители рода —
   светолюбивые и быстрорастущие деревья. Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни у
   них составляет около 100 лет, но известны также редкие экземпляры в
   возрасте приблизительно 300 лет. Диаметр ствола тополя черного может
   значительно превосходить 2 метра; в защищенных условиях дерево может
   вытянуться на 30-метровую высоту.

   Тополь невероятно полезное дерево. Раньше из его древесины делали обувь, а
   корни использовали для изготовления плетеных вещей, а из лыка плели
   рыболовные сети. Из древесины тополя делают спички, поскольку она медленно
   горит. В тополе содержится много целлюлозы, так что из него можно
   производить бумагу. Мягкая древесина тополя легко поддается обработке и
   была популярна у художников эпохи Ренессанса.

Для разных музыкальных инструментов нужны разные породы древесины

   Горные ели особенно ценятся в производстве скрипок. Страдивари и Гварнери
   часто неделями искали подходящие деревья, выстукивая и прослушивая тысячи
   стволов, прежде чем найти «правильную» ель. Создание одной скрипки могло
   стать делом всей жизни: древесину выбранного дерева нужно было сушить и
   выдерживать еще несколько десятков лет. Мастера добивались, чтобы
   древесина пришла в гармонию с колебаниями струн и была особенно устойчива
   к перепадам влажности.

   Древесина рябины глоговины также относится к самым востребованным и
   ценным, ведь она очень прочная. Сегодня ее используют в невероятно сложных
   процессах изготовления волынок и труб для органа. А вот для щипковых и
   струнных инструментов лучше всего подходит древесина клена и липы – у них
   замечательные резонансные свойства и вибрационные характеристики.

   Груша традиционно играет особую роль в изготовлении музыкальных
   инструментов: например, у блок-флейт из этого дерева особый мягкий и
   теплый тембр. Кроме того, духовые инструменты изготавливают из клена,
   бузины, самшита и сосны. А еще из сосновой смолы производят канифоль, без
   которой невозможно обойтись при игре на скрипке, альте, виолончели и
   контрабасе.

Конский каштан сажали для производства пива

   В отличие от многих других деревьев, конский каштан не находит широкого
   применения в хозяйстве или производстве по причине мягкости, непрочности
   и недолговечности. Его древесину использовали, пожалуй, только для
   изготовления кухонных принадлежностей и мебели, а также рукояток и
   округлых дверных ручек. 

   Зато конский каштан сыграл важную роль в истории пивоварения! Эти красивые
   растения сажали в садах многих пивных и пивоварен, особенно в Южной
   Германии. В тени таких деревьев охлаждали пивные бочки. Сегодня их также
   часто высаживают во двориках под открытым небом ради создания неповторимой
   атмосферы и уюта. Эти деревья дарят свою тень и любителям пива, защищая их
   от внезапно разразившегося затяжного дождя.

Бук помогает написать историю человечества

   Гладкая серебристая кора бука прямо-таки просит, чтобы на ней вырезали
   послания для будущих поколений, чтобы доверяли мощному дереву на хранение
   кусочек себя самого. Бесчисленные пары влюбленных под сенью зеленых сводов
   отдают друг другу свои сердца, а затем вырезают сердечки на стволе мощного
   бука. 

   Это не новое явление: языческие предки современных немцев тысячи лет назад
   тоже вырезали изображения в основном на буке, но оставляли не
   свидетельства романтических чувств, а пиктограммы, магические знаки и
   символы. Это были письменные знаки древних германцев — руны (от корня run
   — тайна). Древние жрецы использовали руны в защитных чарах, для магических
   исцелений и предсказаний. Они составили алфавит из 24 графем, который был
   похож на современный, но использовался исключительно для культовых целей.
   Люди срезали безупречные прямые веточки, на них вырезали руны и перед
   принятием важных решений задавали вопросы оракулу из таких буковых
   палочек. Даже немецкое слово Buchstabe — «буква» — происходит от
   Buchenstäbchen — «буковая палочка». Считается, что русское «буква» также
   восходит к слову «бук». Символично, что Иоганн Гутенберг изобрел
   книгопечатание с помощью вырезанной из бука буквы.

Архитектура[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Деревянная архитектура

  Древняя Греция. Архитектура Архаики[править | править код]

   Дерево, как строительный материал, с древнейших времен использовалось в
   местностях с обширными лесными массивами, где в нём не было недостатка. В
   искусстве и архитектуре части стран деревянная архитектура имела
   преобладающую роль. Так, древнейшие постройки в Древней Греции были
   созданы из дерева, и именно в этом материале из стоечно-балочной системы
   создавалась ордерная архитектура. Запад Греции был богат строевым лесом,
   стволы большого диаметра шли на изготовление колонн и бруса перекрытий —
   отсюда монументальность дорического ордера. В восточной Греции леса
   изобиловали деревьями с менее толстыми стволами, поэтому, чтобы получить
   колонну, приходилось соединять между собой несколько стволов. На востоке
   Греции получил развитие зародившийся в Малой Азии более изящный ионический
   ордер^[1]^[2].

   Три яруса классического греческого храма: фундамент, карниз с крышей и
   поддерживающая края крыши колоннада, пришли именно из деревянной
   архитектуры, не имевшей ни одной конструкции, которую нельзя бы было
   исполнить из прямых лесоматериалов. Поэтому в этих постройках не было ни
   куполов, ни арок, ни сводов. Храмы VII—VI вв. до н. э. возводились из
   дерева (колонны, кровля) и кирпича-сырца (стены наоса). Торцы деревянных
   балок, опиравшихся на архитрав (нижний брус карниза), закрывались
   деревянными же планками, между которыми располагались метопы
   (первоначально терракотовые барельефы или живописные картины). От планок,
   фланкирующих балки, пошли триглифы в каменных конструкциях, также
   закрывающие выступающие концы балок. Позднее конструкции сооружений
   постепенно из дерева и кирпича были переведены в камень (сначала
   известняк, а потом мрамор)^[2]. Храмы Древней Греции представляют собой
   успешный перенос конструкции, планировки и ключевых декоративных мотивов
   из одного материала в другой^[1]^[3].

  Древняя Русь[править | править код]

   [IMG]Церковь Преображения Господня на острове Кижи 1714

   На Руси, так же, как и везде, где леса было достаточно, деревянные здания
   появились раньше каменных, и так же, как и в Древней Греции, первоначально
   формы каменного строительства отрабатывались в дереве. Немаловажное
   значение имело то, что строить из дерева было достаточно легко (в том
   числе использовать заранее собранные отдельные блоки) и в короткие сроки.
   На Руси плотники отдавали предпочтение брёвнам, реже использовались брус и
   доска, которые трудно вытесать топором. Доски обыкновенно заменялись
   пластинами — брёвнами, расколотыми надвое. Использовались два приёма
   соединения брёвен в углах сооружения: «с остатком» — наиболее
   распространённый или «без остатка» («в лапу») — достаточно редкий. Кровля
   была двухскатной либо многогранной, шатровой, что позволяло создавать
   различные вариации архитектурных форм. Основная единица русской деревянной
   архитектуры — четырёхугольный (квадратный либо прямоугольный в плане) сруб
   со сторонами 6—8 метров, большие здания конструировались из множества
   подобных срубов. Церковные здания строились из восьмериков, так называемых
   «круглых» срубов, что позволяло увеличить внутренний объем, и из срубов
   крестообразных в плане. Известны церкви, возводившиеся по чьему-либо обету
   за один день. Технология строительства из срубов позволяла легко разбирать
   и перевозить здания для сборки их на новом месте. Так в 1551 году был
   построен город Свияжск — его постройки были срублены в Угличском уезде
   зимой, а весной 1551 года сплавлены по Волге на место будущего города. Все
   здания Свияжска были собраны на новом месте за месяц^[4].

  Британия и Скандинавия[править | править код]

   [IMG]Церковь Святого Андрея. Гринстед, графство Эссекс. Часть здания,
   датируемая XI в. под кровлей позднего периода

   Дерево широко применялось в архитектуре Северной Европы (Ирландии,
   Британии, Германии, Скандинавии). В странах, бывших под владычеством
   Римской империи, после её гибели строительство из камня уступило место
   деревянному зодчеству. В англо-саксонской Британии сам глагол «строить»
   буквально означал «возводить из дерева». Ирландские и британские источники
   периода раннего Средневековья особенно часто упоминают церковные строения
   из дерева. С VII века встречаются детальные описания построек, такие, как
   рассказ о деревянной молельне в «Гесперийских речениях» (стихи 547—560).
   Беда Достопочтенный пишет о деревянных постройках, возводимых «по обычаю
   скоттов» (mos Scottorum), крытых тростником. До настоящего времени дошёл
   деревянный центральный объем церкви Святого Андрея в Гринстеде (графство
   Эссекс, Великобритания), заложенной в XI веке — единственное сохранившееся
   сооружение донорманнского периода. Древнейшая часть неоднократно
   перестроенной церкви согласно последним исследованиям, датируется 1013
   годом. Стены возведены из вертикально поставленных, наподобие
   ограды-частокола, дубовых полукруглых панелей. Судя по рисунку XVIII века,
   сохранившему вид западного фронтона церкви до её перестройки, в её
   конструкции отсутствовали горизонтальные элементы^[5]. Гринстедская
   церковь относится к наиболее распространённому типу церковных строений —
   базиликальному, однако в Британии существовали и более сложные сооружения
   центрического типа, такие как церковь в Поттерне (Уилтшир),
   реконструированная современными археологами. На ковре из Байе (конец XI
   века) изображена в разрезе поджигаемая норманнами двухъярусная церковь, в
   которой спрятались местные жители. Однако небольшое количество
   сохранившихся документальных источников и археологические находки не
   позволяют в достаточной степени восстановить историю британского
   деревянного зодчества эпохи раннего Средневековья^[6].

   В Скандинавию деревянное церковное зодчество пришло вместе с христианством
   через Британию. Представление о древнейшей деревянной архитектуре этого
   региона дают находки, сделанные при археологических раскопках в Швеции,
   Дании, Норвегии. Как сообщает Адам Бременский, в Сконе (южная Швеция)
   существовало 300 церквей. Известно около 10 церквей в Лунде (первая
   половина XI — начало XII в.). Одна из них — построенный в 1050 году
   большой трёхнефный храм Святой Марии, близкий к храмам базиликального
   типа, возведённый, как и церковь в Гринстеде, «частокольным» способом^[7].

Изобразительное искусство[править | править код]

  Скульптура[править | править код]

   [IMG]Йорг Сирлин Старший. Скамьи хоров. 1469-1474. Ульм, собор

   Дерево как материал для скульптуры известно с глубокой древности.
   Древнейшая деревянная скульптура, сохранившаяся до наших дней, — Шигирский
   идол из древесины лиственницы, возраст её, по мнению специалистов,
   составляет 11 600 лет^[8]. Расцвет деревянной скульптуры пришёлся на
   Средние века и раннее Возрождение в центральной Европе, где для храмов
   исполнялись статуи святых, резные алтари (в том числе створчатые,
   распространение которых знаменовало собой переход от готики к Ренессансу),
   кафедры и сидения для хоров. Для скульптурных и резных работ
   использовалось в основном мягкое, лёгкое в обработке, дающее пластичные
   формы липовое или буковое дерево. В алтарях со створками, которые можно
   было закрывать и открывать в соответствии с днями литургического года,
   могли сочетаться живопись и скульптура. По традиции северной готики такие
   алтари имели пределлы, которые также могли быть выполнены из дерева, и
   фигурные навершия, украшенные ажурной резьбой. В своём оригинальном виде
   алтари со створками (крыльями) сохранились в крайне малом количестве,
   большая часть их погибла или была разрознена в годы протестантского
   иконоборчества, по естественным причинам или из-за изменения вкусовых
   предпочтений. Известные мастера (Михаэль Пахер, Фейт Штосс, Тильман
   Рименшнейдер), работавшие в области деревянной скульптуры, способствовали
   развитию алтарных композиций от ранних простых и статических к более
   сложным, многоплановым, оживлённым умелой передачей движения персонажей и
   их эмоционального состояния^[9].

   Типичные мотивы европейской деревянной скульптуры XV века: «Прекрасная
   Мадонна», Христос верхом на осле (сцена въезда в Иерусалим), «Распятие» и
   «Пьета». Статуи святых, помимо прочего, использовались в религиозных
   процессиях. По большей части это произведения анонимных мастеров. Дерево,
   казавшееся в ту пору слишком простым по сравнению с мрамором и бронзой,
   раскрашивалось и золотилось. Уже в конце XV века под влиянием творчества
   Йорга Сирлина и Рименшнейдера деревянная скульптура лишается окраски, и
   зрители обретают возможность видеть естественные цвет и рисунок
   натурального дерева^[10].

   [IMG]Деисус, праздники, пророки. Походная икона-складень. Новгород, 2-я
   половина XVI века. Дерево, резьба. Музей им. А. Рублева

   На Руси деревянная религиозная скульптура и резные иконы существовали,
   несмотря на отрицательное отношение к объемным изображениям святых,
   характерное для православной христианской традиции, воспринятой от
   Византии, с давних времён. Одни из ранних образцов этого вида искусства —
   икона «Архангел Михаил в деянии» (XII в., в настоящее время хранится в
   Махачкале), изображение Николы Можайского (начало XIII в.), «Распятие»
   (Тутаев) — относятся к домонгольскому периоду. С переходом во второй
   половине XII века ведущего политического значения от Киева к
   Владимиро-Суздальскому княжеству это вид изобразительного искусства
   приобрел первостепенное значение. В период татаро-монгольского ига, на
   севере Руси и в Новгороде, которые были обойдены захватчиками, деревянная
   скульптура широко использовалась в убранстве интерьеров церквей. В конце
   XV века в Новгороде и Пскове отмечается её бурное развитие. О значении
   резных деревянных икон, распятий, статуй святых (наиболее распространены
   были изображения святых Георгия, Николая, Параскевы) свидетельствуют
   официальные документы, летописи и литературные произведения того времени.
   В конце XIV — начале XV веков в резные рельефы начали переводиться
   чудотворные иконы: Владимирская Богоматерь, Спас Нерукотворный, последняя,
   кроме прочего, использовалась в тябловых и ярусных иконостасах. Расцвет
   русской деревянной скульптуры пришёлся на XVI век, когда в значимых
   городах Русского царства возводились соборы по образу московского
   Успенского собора. Как и в Москве, в новых соборах устраивались
   подкупольные амвоны с живописными иконами и деревянными горельефами и
   статуями святых, которые, как кариатиды, служили опорами для всего
   сооружения^[11]. Помимо Москвы, где после русско-польской войны
   (1654—1667) в Оружейной палате работали резчики из Польши и Белоруссии,
   среди центров с активно развивавшимися традициями деревянной скульптуры
   можно назвать Великий Новгород, Ростов Великий, монастыри русского Севера:
   Соловецкий, Кирилло-Белозерский, Спасо-Прилуцкий^[12].

  Живопись[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Дерево (живопись)

   Дерево, как основа под живопись, известно со времён античности. Плиний
   Старший сообщает, что афинский художник Аполлодор (вторая половина V в. до
   н. э.) писал свои картины на деревянных досках. Самые ранние произведения
   изобразительного искусства на деревянной основе, сохранившиеся до наших
   дней, — фаюмские портреты (I—III вв. н. э.). Ассортимент древесины для
   фаюмских портретов разнообразен: они писались на тонких дощечках из
   смоковницы, кипариса, ливанского кедра, пинии, сосны, лиственницы. В
   средние века итальянские живописцы предпочитали мягкую древесину. Ченнино
   Ченнини в своей работе «Книга об искусстве» рекомендует использовать иву и
   липу. Леон Баттиста Альберти называет предпочтительные сорта для живописи:
   лиственницу (долговечную и не дающую трещин), тополь белый и чёрный, иву,
   граб, рябину, бузину и смоковницу. По его сообщению, древесина этих пород
   достаточно суха, надёжно держит клей и подмалёвок, а краски ложатся на неё
   равномерно. Дуб же, по мнению Альберти, не подходит для живописи, так как
   не воспринимает клей^[13]. По словам Вазари, итальянцы предпочитали белый
   тополь из-за его мягкости и, в то же время прочности при креплении
   мастикой, а венецианцы, когда писали на деревянной основе, выбирали ель,
   так как её в изобилии сплавляли из Германии по реке Адидже, а также
   получали из Славонии. Древесина как основа для живописи широко применялась
   до XVII века. В Италии доски использовали параллельно с холстом в XVI
   столетии, во Фландрии, Голландии и Германии деревянная основа была
   предпочтительной, особенно для картин малого формата, ещё в XVII веке. Тем
   не менее известны и масштабные произведения на дереве, например, алтарные
   картины Рубенса. На Руси живопись на досках была широко распространена до
   конца XVII века. Подавляющее большинство русских икон написаны на липовых
   досках, далее по частоте использования идут сосна и ель, реже применялись
   бук и лиственница^[14]. Даже после того, как главенствующее положение
   среди основ для живописи занял холст, и в Европе и в России продолжали
   появляться картины на дереве^[15].

   Выбирая основу для будущей картины, художники, прежде всего, использовали
   древесину, характерную для данной местности. Это обстоятельство помогает
   исследователям определить с большой долей вероятности, по крайней мере это
   характерно для западноевропейской живописи XIII—XVI вв., где создавалась
   картина. Необходимо также иметь представление о древней флоре той или иной
   местности^[16]. После XVI века развитие международных связей (прежде всего
   торговля) и снижение требований к качеству материалов привели к расширению
   выбора основы. Так, в Голландии художники использовали для картин доски
   старых кораблей и пивных бочек — древесина, находившаяся долгое время под
   воздействием сначала воды, а потом (при сушке) солнечного света, не
   коробилась и не гнила. Некоторые картины Рембрандта написаны на красном
   дереве, ввозимом из колоний. В России появились кипарисовые доски и их
   даже научились подделывать — об этом сообщает русский автор первой трети
   XVII в.^[14]

   Ориентируясь на размер будущей картины (иконы), основу для неё делали либо
   из одной целой доски, либо из составленных вместе нескольких досок
   (известны случаи, когда картины писались на щите из двадцати досок). Доски
   между собой соединяли сначала клеем: казеиновым, мездровым, из обрезков
   пергамента, альбуминовый. Стыки с оборотной стороны покрывали грунтом,
   считая, что так обеспечивается их неподвижность. Подобные соединения
   характерны для каталонской школы живописи XII века, Франции, Германии,
   Италии в XIII—XIV веках. Еще один ранний способ соединения — с помощью
   деревянных шипов, вставляемых в паз, вырезанный в плоскости стыка. Шипы на
   целых щитах можно увидеть только при рентгенографическом исследовании. По
   принципу «шипа» делалось соединение, при котором на торце одной из досок
   по всей длине вытачивался выступ, на другой, также по всей длине — паз.
   Это соединение видно с торца основы^[17].

   [IMG]Джорджоне. Юдифь. Картина была написана на дереве около 1504 года. В
   1893 году в Эрмитаже переведена на холст реставратором А. Сидоровым

   Западноевропейские художники работали на основах, составленных из одного
   вида древесины. Считалось, что разное дерево нельзя не только соединять в
   одну основу, но даже и хранить рядом доски разных пород. Однако в составе
   алтарных комплексов, полиптихов, триптихов и диптихов встречаются основы
   из разного дерева. Подлинность всего произведения подтверждается, если это
   породы деревьев из одной местности, той, где оно было создано. Картины,
   написанные одним художником приблизительно в одно время, исполнялись на
   досках одного ствола, исследователям не известны случаи использования
   досок одного ствола разными мастерами^[17].

   Доски для живописи, в зависимости от места и времени создания
   произведения, применялись различной толщины: от 2 мм (Фаюм) до очень
   толстых основ итальянского раннего Возрождения. Иконы в технике энкаустики
   VI—VIII веков имеют толщину 10—12 мм. Самые ранние иконы Руси выполнялись
   на очень тонких досках, впоследствии русские мастера выбирали более
   толстую основу. Художники Северной Европы в XVII веке использовали доски
   толщиной 8—10 мм^[18].

   Серьёзный недостаток деревянной основы — способность материала, даже
   хорошо высушенного, поглощать и отдавать влагу из воздуха. Из-за
   гигроскопичности древесины происходит постоянное движение её волокон и она
   коробится, вызывая разрушения грунта и красочного слоя картин. Чтобы
   предохранить живописные основы от коробления, их заключали в специальные
   рамы с креплением винтами (так поступил Дюрер с центральной частью
   «Вознесения Марии») или создавали на оборотной стороне целые системы из
   деревянных планок, ограничивающие движение досок одним направлением.
   Позднее, в XVIII веке, реставраторы стали применять метод паркетирования
   (паркетаж), благодаря которому доски картины приспосабливались к перепадам
   влажности и температуры воздуха без коробления^[17]. При паркетировании
   часть деревянной основы с обратной стороны картины удаляется
   (состругивается), далее к ней подклеиваются деревянные планки,
   направленные по древесным волокнам доски. Планки имеют отверстия, в
   которые вставляются перпендикулярно другие планки. Это позволяет древесине
   расширяться и сужаться, не вызывая коробления и трещин^[19]. Таким образом
   в 1740 году французский реставратор Хакен, с именем которого связывают
   распространение этого метода, паркетировал картину Рубенса. Метод
   паркетажа широко использовался в XIX веке, как при реставрации старых
   картин, так и при создании новых произведений. Паркетаж исполнялся из
   дорогих сортов дерева, а столяры-краснодеревщики, укреплявшие картины,
   нередко подписывали свою работу^[20].

   Деревянная основа поражается древоточцами — это характерно для досок из
   мягких пород дерева, в меньшей степени портятся доски из дуба (благодаря
   содержащемуся в нём танину) и хвойных пород (из-за смолы). Основы
   старинных картин, поражённые насекомыми, утончались реставраторами в
   XVIII—XIX веках. Иногда деревянная основа удалялась полностью
   (состругивалась), а красочный слой переводился на новую основу — чаще
   всего холст, реже — на дерево или медь. Широкое распространение, несмотря
   на высокую вероятность порчи картины, перевод живописи с дерева на холст
   получил в Италии (где, вероятно, и был изобретён в 1720-х годах) и,
   особенно, во Франции^[21].

                                  дереве. 1511

   Самая ранняя гравюрная техника, ксилогравюра, гравюра на дереве, появилась
   в Японии в VIII веке. Техника гравирования была близка к технике
   изготовления досок для набойки. Изначально на деревянных досках из груши,
   самшита, дикой вишни вырезались буддийские тексты. Расцвет обрезной (на
   досках продольного распила) японской гравюры приходится на XVII век.
   Мягкие плавные линии и области цветовых пятен обрезались с двух сторон
   ножами со скошенными лезвиями или резцами. Для детальной проработки
   рисунка применялись небольшие ножички. Лишнее дерево между выступающими
   местами доски выбиралось долотом. Полученные формы для выпуклой гравюры
   покрывались красками из минерального или растительного сырья в смеси с
   пастой из риса, при этом краска не попадала в углубления доски. Цветная
   гравюра печаталась в несколько приёмов, отдельно для каждого цвета^[22].
   При сдержанной красочной гамме, не всегда соответствующей натуральному
   цвету^[23], и обобщённо-условной форме, японская гравюра (даже в
   чёрно-белом исполнении) отличается особенной утончённой декоративностью.

   Европейская обрезная ксилогравюра, произведения которой были доступны
   широким слоям населения, долгое время была монохромной. В Европе гравюра
   на дереве была известна с XIV века, европейцев с гравюрой (через игральные
   карты, которые чаще всего печатались с деревянных досок) познакомили
   арабы. До начала XV века в европейской гравюре господствовал контурный
   рисунок. Вскоре методом гравирования стали производить печатные листы с
   изображением и текстом, которыми украшали стены в домах. Самый ранний
   образец такого листа датируется 1423 годом. Со второй трети XIV века в
   Германии и Голландии распространились небольшие брошюры или «блочные
   книги», где картинки вместе с текстом печатались с гравировальной доски.
   Одна из самых массовых книжек этого вида — «Библия для бедных», старейший
   экземпляр которой отпечатан в 1430—1440 годах (Гейдельберг,
   Университетская библиотека). Для каждой страницы подобной книги
   требовалось изготовить свою граверную доску^[24].

   Развитие европейской гравюры на дереве тесно связано с творчеством
   Альбрехта Дюрера, его произведения, где использовалась только одна краска
   — чёрная, не уступали, по мнению некоторых современников, живописным
   произведениям. Дюрер изменил господствовавшую ранее манеру работы в
   ксилографии, перенеся в эту область технические приёмы, характерные для
   гравюры на металле. С помощью разнообразной штриховки он стремился
   передать как можно более правдоподобно объём предметов и нюансы светотени,
   ставя весьма трудные задачи для резчика. По мнению части исследователей
   его творчества, некоторые гравюры он резал сам^[25]. Расцвет европейской
   ксилографии пришёлся на первую половину XVI века, позднее её место заняла
   гравюра на металле, в книгопечатании ксилография стала использоваться
   только для воспроизведения виньеток. В гравюре на меди легче передать игру
   полутонов, так как для создания тонких штрихов использовался
   резец-штихель, на доске продольного распила штихелем работать невозможно —
   он рвёт поперечные древесные волокна, при печати такой обрез даёт грязный,
   зазубренный штрих^[26].

   В 1780-х годах Томас Бьюик изобрёл торцовую (или тоновую, репродукионную)
   гравюру — на досках, собираемых из пластин поперечного распила твёрдых
   сортов дерева. Получалась твёрдая и однородная по строению поверхность,
   подходящая для работы штихелями. Форма для печати получается более
   прочной, с неё можно сделать больше отпечатков, чем с доски продольного
   распила. При торцовом способе гравирования стало возможным получать в один
   рез штрихи различной толщины до самых тонких. Штрихи при печати остаются
   белыми — Бьюик использовал при работе на дереве приёмы углублённой
   гравюры, и получил возможность создавать сложные тональные и цветовые
   переходы с помощью белых, а не чёрных, как в обрезной гравюре,
   штрихов^[27]^[28].

                                    Городец

   Пряничная доска — форма из древесины преимущественно лиственных пород для
   производства печатных пряников^[29] с вырезанным на ней контррельефным
   узором. В германских землях резкой досок занимались сами пекари либо
   резчики-гравёры, в некоторых местностях производство форм для пряников
   было тесным образом связано с производством досок для набойки ткани. Кроме
   дерева для пряничных форм использовались и другие материалы, такие как
   камень и глина. Глиняные формы, в отличие от деревянных, были известны ещё
   в античную эпоху^[30], но именно деревянные доски при массовом
   производстве пряников были наиболее удобными^[31]. Самые древние
   европейские деревянные формы, дошедшие до наших дней, датируются XVI
   веком^[32]. В словацких Кошице и Банска-Быстрице были обнаружены
   деревянные пряничные доски, датируемые 1631 и 1635 годами
   соответственно^[33].

   В России в XVII веке рисунки для московских пряничных досок создавали
   «кормовые московские и городские иконописцы»^[34]. Одним из центров
   изготовления пряничных досок и пряников с XVIII века был Городец — местные
   мастера, в отличие от европейских, подписывали свои изделия. Две самые
   ранние датированные городецкие доски для пряников — 1763 и 1766 годов —
   экспонируются в Государственном историческом музее. Пряничные доски из
   Городца поставлялись и в другие города России. Наряду с городецкими были
   известны пряничные формы из Москвы, Тулы, Твери, Вязьмы, Архангельска и
   Вологды^[35]^[36].

   Деревянные доски в Восточной Европе резались из древесины берёзы, липы,
   груши, ивы, ольхи и осины. Западноевропейские резчики использовали верхнюю
   часть ствола груши, грецкого ореха, бука, ели, клёна, реже дуба. В конце
   XVIII века появляются многочисленные доски из самшита, ценившегося за
   однородную структуру древесины. Австрийский этнолог Э. Хёранднер отмечала,
   что приблизительно до 1600 года германские резчики использовали доски
   торцового распила, в XVII веке они перешли на доски продольного
   распила^[31].

   Если было необходимо создать тонкий узор со множеством деталей, то
   выбиралась твёрдая древесина берёзы или груши, эти виды дерева отличаются
   прочностью, формы из них могут прослужить долгие годы. Узор с высоким
   рельефом и пластичными линиями лучше всего получается на легко
   обрабатываемой липовой доске, однако доски из этой древесины
   недолговечны^[31]. Существовали составные пряничные формы, где собственно
   часть из дорогой древесины, с которой печатался пряник крепилась на базу
   из дерева низшего качества^[37].

   Первоначально источниками мотивов для европейских пряничных форм были
   гравюры на дереве и меди, широко распространявшиеся по немецким землям в
   XV—XVI веках, образцами служили и ювелирные изделия. В эпоху барокко
   мастерство резчиков возрастает, и выпускаются формы с более сложными
   узорами^[31].

   В XX веке, при переходе на промышленный способ производства печатных и
   фигурных пряников, неоднократно предпринимались попытки заменить
   деревянные пряничные доски формами из других материалов. Однако именно
   деревянные доски считаются наиболее подходящими для формирования изделий
   из пряничного теста, и до настоящего времени в центрах производства этого
   кондитерского изделия сохраняется профессия резчика досок^[38].

   Гороскоп деревьев древнего календаря друидов
   Гороскоп деревьев древнего календаря друидов

Загадочные мудрецы друиды умели делать точные предсказания, предпочитали жить в
лесу и даже составили свой собственный гороскоп.

   Для того чтобы получить почетное звание друида, человек должен был
   провести двадцать лет в полном одиночестве в лесу.
   Лес они считали святым местом. С деревьями жрецы обходились как с живыми
   существами, наделяя их душой и даже характером. Они утверждали, что каждое
   дерево, как и человек, имеет свои определенные черты, достоинства и
   недостатки. Каждое требует определенных условий жизни.

    Согласно их науке, дата рождения каждого человека связана с определенным
    растением. Положение Солнца относительно Земли служит основой их гороскопа.
    В соответствии с ним, судьба человека, его будущее, характер и способности
    зависят от удаления Солнца от Земли в день его рождения. Поэтому каждый знак
    гороскопа друидов имеет два периода действия.

   Друиды верили: чтобы изменить свою судьбу к лучшему, нужно наладить связь
   со своим деревом: общаться с ним при помощи прикосновений. Считалось, что
   в сложное время человек должен пойти в лес или сад, найти дерево,
   соответствующее дате рождения, и поговорить с ним, прислониться к его
   стволу и физически представить себе, как энергия дерева перетекает в его
   тело. После чего полагалось поклониться дереву, поблагодарить его и
   напоследок украсить ленточкой.

   Вот так выглядит гороскоп друидов (в скобках указаны периоды, в которые
   владычествует данное дерево). Считалось, что наибольшую магическую силу и,
   как следствие, наибольшую помощь своему человеку дерево оказывает в
   периоды своего верховенства.

  Яблоня

   Яблоня радует взгляд — она очень привлекательна, очаровательна,
   сентиментальна и нежна. Часто она вступает в брак, не испытывая больших
   чувств к партнеру (яблоня — очень универсальное дерево, умеет хорошо
   подстраиваться), но это не означает, что она окончательно готова
   отказаться от этого прекрасного чувства. Если судьба пошлет ей партнера,
   полностью подходящего по духу, то их брак станет истинным наслаждением для
   обоих. Яблоня очень лояльна и терпима в отношениях, с ней легко.

   Гороскоп друидов говорит, что люди-яблони бескорыстные и доверчивые, их
   можно легко обмануть. Они добрые, если надо, снимут последнюю рубашку.

   Эти люди нередко живут, не думая о завтрашнем дне, именно сегодня, здесь и
   сейчас. Бывает, что берут в долг и забывают об этом. Любят жизнь,
   философствовать, фантазировать и не любят что-то кому-то доказывать.
   Однако, не стоит принимать яблоню как легкомысленное создание. Будучи
   умными и продуманными людьми, яблони склонны к обучению и наукам. Они
   читают все, что связано с областью, которая им интересна. Объем их знаний
   на удивление большой, но они никого не стремятся поразить этим.

   Однообразное «гладкое» счастье, без каких-либо недостатков, приносит
   яблоне скуку. Эти люди, время от времени, любят усложнять себе жизнь.

  Пихта

   Она красива своей «простой», а иногда даже холодной красотой. Любит
   антикварную бижутерию, легкие ароматы и полные загадочности праздники.

   Пихта капризна и с ней не всегда легко ладить. Имея сильное чувство
   самодостаточности, она отлично чувствует себя в одиночестве. Но

   всегда выслушает окружающих и может последовать чьему-то совету. Свою
   собственную позицию, между тем, высказывает редко. Не слишком болтливый,
   но веселый человек.

   Гордая, упрямая, способная достигать своих целей — пихта имеет успех в
   жизни. А вот в любовных делах ей бывает трудно угодить. Очень
   требовательна и бескомпромиссна. Хочет многого от жизни, а поскольку знает
   свои возможности, то обычно это получает. Может влюбляться, а затем
   полностью все разрушать. Но и ее любовь может не иметь границ.

   Гороскоп деревьев сообщает, что пихта мыслит научным способом, но не
   всегда это приводит ее к желаемому успеху. Случается так, что она выбирает
   то поле деятельности, которое не имеет ничего общего с ее способностями.

   Однако, она серьезный, скрупулезный и ответственный работник, и благодаря
   этому может достичь определенных успехов в карьере. Но имеет привычку
   выбирать самые трудные пути. Вообще, создание сложных ситуаций для себя и
   для других — это ее призвание.

   Эти люди благородны, что бы ни случилось — вы можете полностью полагаться
   на них. В любой ситуации они могут сохранить присутствие ума.

  Вяз

   Вяз не слишком заботится о себе, он просто одевается, часто не может
   выбросить старый свитер или потертые джинсы. Не требовательный и не любит
   усложнять свою жизнь. Самым большим недостатком людей-вязов является лень.

   Несмотря на их внешнюю силу и мощь, вязы имеют слабое здоровье.

   Это открытые и щедрые люди, что иногда даже обескураживает. Они верят в
   доброту других. Не боятся неудач, ведь знают, что могут быть намного
   сильнее, чем многие других в их ситуации.

   Для родных эти люди способны сделать все, что угодно, у них сильное
   чувство ответственности и долга.

   В любви вяз страстный, иногда даже очень. Если он находит настоящую
   любовь, то создает удивительно крепкую и образцовую семью (при поддержке
   партнера, естественно). Но любит править, его требования столь же высоки,
   как и его любовь. Относитесь к нему терпеливо, он этого заслуживает, вязы
   — очень верные люди. Острый ум и растущие из нужного места руки, станут
   отличным подспорьем в семье.

   Обычно жизнь этих людей проходит без каких-либо сильных потрясений. Они
   добиваются всего, чего хотят для себя.

  Кипарис

   Стройный, с резко очерченным силуэтом и простыми правильными чертами.
   Однако, он не без утонченности. В нем ничего от человека, испорченного
   благами цивилизации и современного мира.

   Кипарис может довольствоваться совсем немногим в этой жизни, к любой
   ситуации адаптируется достаточно легко. Жить способен в любых условиях, и
   это не помешает стать ему счастливым.

   Не придает большого значения успеху в жизни, деньги и слава для него
   далеко не самое главное. Его цель — быть счастливым, и в ее достижении его
   невозможно остановить.

   Кипарис любит легкие летние прогулки, животных и природу. Его не пугает
   одиночество, он наслаждается им. Но свою жизнь будет выстраивать таким
   образом, чтобы всегда находиться в окружении друзей и семьи.

   Не сентиментальный человек. Бывает довольно груб, но в нем есть внутренняя
   теплота. С ним приятно находиться рядом, его присутствие успокаивает.

   Обожает мечтать, часто его мысли улетают куда-то далеко. Острых тем в
   разговоре избегает, независимо от своей точки зрения. Но устроить дебаты
   не прочь, и к его мнению прислушиваются. Гибкий и верный в дружбе и любви.

   Чаще всего жизнь этих людей проходит легко и спокойно среди тех, кто ему
   дорог.

  Тополь

   С юности в нем есть некоторая декоративность, утонченная форма и красота.
   Однако, становясь старше, он доставляет неприятности самому себе: из-за
   своей сильной чувствительности ко времени и боязни старости, тополь
   выглядит старше, чем он есть на самом деле. Но поддержка и похвала близких
   могут помочь ему, поэтому эти люди тщательно выбирают людей, с которыми
   будут общаться.

   В друидском гороскопе по дате рождения сказано, что тополю нужно быть
   осторожным с выбором места жительства и работы. Окружающая обстановка
   очень важна для этих людей. Они очень нуждаются в друзьях, общении и
   комфорте, и бывает, что часто страдают от того, что выбрали неправильную
   окружающую среду.

   Тополь очень чувствителен к ограничениям свободы и может легко впасть в
   депрессию, если его пытаться «посадить на поводок».

   Любовь его хрупка, любая, даже самая мелкая, неприятность может вывести
   его из равновесия и все испортить. Поэтому в браке с ним бывает сложно,
   однако, он сам способен сглаживать те или иные острые углы, без истерик и
   с улыбкой.

   Возможно, вас заинтересует статья о том, как узнать свой тотем. В ней мы
   рассказали о том, как найти свое тотемное животное.

   Те, кто мало знаком с тополем, будут считать его веселым и спокойным
   человеком, но это не всегда так.

   Эти люди не материалисты, они настроены на альтруизм. У них острый ум, они
   проницательны, иногда кажутся высокомерными.

   Тополей много среди врачей.

  Кедр

   Мощный кедр имеет довольно-таки внушительный вид. Он способен подстроиться
   под любую ситуацию. Не против комфорта, но если придется может и на
   лавочке в парке поспать. Имеет превосходное здоровье и для него это важно.

   Не знает, что такое застенчивость и везде чувствует себя как дома. Уверен
   в себе, и это притягивает людей. Но в тоже время, кедр очень чувствителен
   к шуткам относительно него самого, он их вряд ли оценит.

   Ему нравится свобода, он обожает находиться в центре внимания, и будет к
   этому стремиться. Считает, что последнее слово всегда за ним.

   Иногда склонен к излишествам, причем во всех жизненных аспектах.

   Не знает страха, способен выйти «сухим из воды». Сложные ситуации не
   ломают его, кедр — неисправимый оптимист. Но при всей своей видимой мощи,
   он может попасть под чье-то влияние. Грамотный манипулятор способен «вить
   из него веревки». Но и на окружающих люди-кедры могут оказывать
   колоссальное влияние.

   Кедр очень преданный своему делу человек, возможно поэтому среди них много
   героев и мучеников. Это настойчивые люди, которые считают, что всегда
   правы.

   Однако, в любви он мягкий, нежный и сентиментальный. К объекту страсти
   прикипает навсегда, и при таком раскладе будет воспринимать эти чувства,
   как нечто высшее.

   Очень умный человек, скорость его мыслей и решений удивительна. Имеет
   творческие способности, в основном в музыке, возможно, это из-за
   врожденного чувства ритма.

   Рожденный для приключений, кедр обычно имеет довольно насыщенную жизнь.

  Сосна

   У нее изысканный силуэт, она изящная, это подчеркивает ее достоинства.
   Если верить гороскопу друидов, она всегда знает, чего хочет, и не
   позволяет течению просто нести ее по волнам, ей недостаточно того, что
   жизнь дает сама, всегда нужно большего. И эти люди умеют достигать своих
   целей.

   Будучи мужественной, сосна встречает любую проблему с высоко поднятой
   головой, и не позволяет, каким-то жизненным трудностям одолеть ее. В
   работе может иметь успех на любом поле деятельности.

   Сосна отличается упорством, с которым она идет по жизни. Очень быстрая и
   точная в действиях, она может выйти из любой сложной ситуации.

   Несмотря на приветливость и умение быть хорошим другом, эти люди не
   отличаются чрезмерной щедростью. Они немного эгоисты, собственные
   процветание и комфорт — прежде всего.

   Слабость проявляют только в одном — в любви. Они чувствительны и
   импульсивны — могут легко влюбиться, натворить опрометчивых поступков,
   думать о которых будет уже слишком поздно.

   При всем этом, у сосен проницательный ум и хорошие организаторские
   способности. Благодаря своему пробивному характеру они справляются с
   любыми проблемами, даже любовными.

   Особенно благоприятно покровительство сосны для женщин.

  Ива

   Ива привлекает своей меланхолической красотой, даже если не брать в расчет
   ее видимое очарование, в ней все равно есть что-то загадочное.

   Эти люди очень мягки, любят солнышко, и умеют ловить моменты радости.

   Но не верьте внешней нежности ивы. Она весьма решительная, хорошо знает,
   чего хочет. Никогда не будет что-то навязывать кому-то, все дело в
   огромном чувстве уважения к окружающим.

   Ее беспомощность — лишь уловка, иногда для развлечения, а иногда и ради
   личной выгоды, ива может притвориться слабой и беззащитной, но если
   потребуется, защитить себя тоже сможет превосходно.

   У ивы бывают моменты меланхоличности. Но не воспринимайте слишком серьезно
   ее осенние настроения и разговоры о быстротечности жизни. Ивы склонны к
   драматизму, в этом их сложность, не все способны это понять и принять.

   Людям-ивам сложно пройти быструю адаптацию, они не любят компромиссы.
   Здесь придется только смириться, потому как «переделать» их под себя не
   получится.

   В любви ива больше романтична, чем сентиментальна. Не любит обычных,
   тусклых чувств. К тому же, любовь без страданий не имеют слишком высокой
   ценности для нее, а потому, «для увеличения веса», ива привносит в них эту
   толику страданий.

   У нее есть хорошие творческие способности, интуиция и богатое воображение.
   Из таких людей получаются талантливые психологи.

  Липа

   Она потрясающе очаровательна и знает это. Мечтает о стабильной, комфортной
   жизни, но это для нее далеко не главное, и не всегда имеет какое-то
   весомое значение. Легко привыкает к любым жизненным условиям. Ей
   достаточно шалаша, чтобы создать атмосферу домашнего уюта и тепла.

   Липа выглядит слабой, тихой, загадочной, и со всем этим она безмятежна и
   даже немного пессимистична. Часто такие люди всю свою жизнь проживают с
   чувством скуки. Это их главный враг.

   Очень восприимчива к лести, не привыкла в чем-либо сомневаться и очень
   привлекательна. С такими людьми приятно и легко общаться, сразу появляется
   чувство психологического комфорта. Липа будет терпеливо слушать своего
   собеседника. Это, вообще, очень уважительные люди, которые с почтением
   относятся к своим родственникам, и не стремится манипулировать людьми. Их
   все любят.

   У липы практический ум и склонность к техническим наукам, она
   сообразительна и точна.

   Если в своей жизни она встречает вторую половинку — тогда супружеская
   любовь поможет избавиться от внутренних противоречий. Но с липой в
   отношениях сложно, не имея сильного чувства самоуважения, она часто
   ревнует, без причин.

   влияют на человека?

  Орешник

   Выглядит слабым и непривлекательным, но если с ним сблизиться, то вы,
   несомненно, уступите его очарованию. Очень умен и способен адаптироваться
   к различным жизненным условиям.

   В нем есть что-то магическое. Если орешник захочет, то сделает так, что
   окружающие начнут подстраиваться по него.

   Во всем гороскопе друидов нет более неоднозначного знака, чем орешник. Он
   может быть добрым, мудрым, терпеливым, но в тоже время и опасным, и злым.
   Все в нем — волшебство! И все зависит от его настроения или каприза. От
   этих людей можно ожидать чего угодно. С ними нужно быть очень осторожными
   — они довольно неуравновешенны.

   Несмотря на свою природную скромность, орешник очень оригинален, он
   относится к жизни по-разному. Способен угадывать самые тайные мысли и
   делать неожиданные предложения.

   В любви орешник может быть как самым милым, любящим и любимым, так и самым
   невыносимым партнером. Но если вы не боитесь рисковать, тогда проявите
   заботу о нем. И даже если совместная жизнь не принесет покоя, это все
   равно станет довольно увлекательным приключением.

   Эти люди очень эрудированы, быстро и легко учатся. Но, в общем и целом,
   все зависит только от их желания.

  Рябина (Пираканта)

   Ее нежный вид скрывает сильный характер. Она безумно очаровательная и
   почти всегда улыбается, но не из-за внутренней бодрости, а из-за
   самоконтроля. Рябина может подчеркнуть свои достоинства и любит хорошо
   одеваться. У нее от природы идеальный вкус. Моментально способна
   адаптироваться на месте, хорошо подстраивается под окружающих.

   Ей нравится радоваться людям и радовать их, даже в ущерб себе. Она не
   эгоцентрик, но эгоизм в ней, определенно, есть. Очень независима, но
   иногда позволяет другим думать, что это не так. Может страдать комплексом
   вины. Долго общаться с ней трудно, а отношения сложны.

   Рябина очень впечатлительна, особенно отличается своей любовью к
   совершенству и приветливостью. Вы всегда можете положиться на нее. Она
   мила, выглядит наивной и даже дурочкой, но не позволит другим
   эксплуатировать себя.

   В любви эти люди очень много отдают, но взамен требуют столько же. Им
   постоянно нужно испытывать чувства, и если вы не способны этого дать
   партнеру-рябине, то она вас разочарует. И помните, с рябиной нельзя шутить
   и обманывать ее, она не прощает подобных вещей.

   Рябина не предаст. Ее личная жизнь очень насыщенна и наполнена заботами и
   мечтами о завтрашнем дне. Такие люди осмотрительны, умны и практичны.
   Иногда случается так, что они не материализуют какие-то из своих планов,
   но это только из-за того, что слишком заняты повседневными делами.

  Клен

   Он эффектен, ухожен и чуточку кокетлив. Часто оказывается там, где
   происходят самые интересные вещи. Модник. Очень жизнерадостный и
   энергичный.

   Гороскоп деревьев говорит, что клен всегда на высоте. Индивидуалист,
   слегка сдержанный и не очень-то смелый. Рискованные решения принимать не
   любит, но может, и чаще всего они не касаются материальных вещей.

   Клен совсем не домосед, ему нужны новые люди, новые эмоции, новые
   впечатления! Он почти не бывает в той ситуации, когда вокруг нет друзей. У
   него они есть всегда, он притягивает людей, так как умеет дружить: никогда
   никого не не осудит и не выдаст чужие тайны.

   Обычно у этих людей много планов, часто весьма эксцентричных. Их
   захватывают новые идеи. Клены могут быть циниками, не любят и не боятся
   общественного мнения. И даже напротив, провоцируют людей говорить о них.

   В любви с кленом сложно, но свое счастье он всегда найдет, главное, как
   говорится, встретить своего человека.

   Клен не лишен воображения и интуиции, умен, в общем и целом, это очень
   универсальные и интересные люди.

  Грецкий орех

   Стильный, утонченный и привлекательный внешне, на деле он очень робкий.
   Грецкий орех соткан из противоречий:

   капризный,

   агрессивный,

   эгоистичный.

   Но очень приятный, вежливый и гостеприимный. Верный и надежный, он с
   легкостью может стать непостоянным. Никогда не знаешь, с какой стороны к
   нему подходить. Без каких-либо оснований грецкий орех может порадовать вас
   или обидеть.

   Иногда ему нравится пострадать, и он с удовольствием заставляет других
   страдать вместе с ним. С такими людьми нужно быть внимательными, иначе они
   полностью подчинят вас своей воле.

   В жизни грецкий орех отличный стратег. Он знает к чему приводят его
   намерения, нередко способен на совершение коварных поступков, и не сильно
   страдает от угрызения совести. Он часто доминирует над другими. Но бывают
   и очень скромные грецкие орехи.

   Такой человек стремится к тому, чтобы его жизнь была не обычной. Не боится
   никакого риска, не стремится угодить, не признает компромиссы, не идет по
   избитым дорогам. У грецкого ореха может быть много друзей, и так же много
   врагов. Он считает, что в жизни вы можете рассчитывать только на себя.
   Заботится только о своей независимости. Таких людей очень сложно
   игнорировать.

  Жасмин

   Живой и общительный, притягивает своим умением строить непринужденные
   беседы, и даже помимо своей воли, становится объектом всеобщего внимания.
   Для всех он кажется уравновешенным, смешным и не обремененным жизненными
   сложностями человеком. Но только самые близкие люди знают, насколько
   жасмин в действительности чувствителен. Его легко расстроить, возможно,
   именно поэтому много жасминов — пессимисты.

   Весьма скрытен и подозрителен. Но способен выстраивать гармоничные
   отношения и дипломатия ему не чужда. К сожалению, все это редко
   показывается в собственном доме. Здесь он не будет вести себя сдержано, не
   признает ограничений, а обязательства удручают его, несмотря на
   обостренное чувства долга.

   Ответственность не всегда приносит жасмину радость и удовлетворение, но
   она ему не чужда. Брак с ним очень тяжелый. Жасмин талантливо умеет
   разочаровывать партнеров. А вот детям с ним легко, ему с детьми, кстати,
   тоже. Малыши его обожают, а он способен дать им ответ на любой вопрос в
   простой и понятной форме. Дети — вот его радость в жизни.

   Эти люди не материалисты, но часто у них хороший заработок. Они не боятся
   труда, их ум и свежие идеи высоко ценятся руководством.

   описание и ссылки на подробные статьи.

  Каштан

   Каштан безумно красивый, возможно даже слегка декоративный, но своей
   привлекательностью он не стремиться покорить весь мир. Для жизни ему нужно
   пространство, он полон сил. В каштане есть врожденное чувство
   справедливости. Он готов бороться за свою правоту любыми способами,
   независимо от последствий.

   Ему не нравятся бережливость, любые тактические и дипломатические уловки,
   и это часто настраивает людей против него. Отсутствие согласия в общении с
   другими приводит к смене многих профессий и, конечно, к разочарованиям,
   которые он, из-за своей впечатлительности, помнит долго.

   Несмотря на свою настойчивость и самообладание, он не бывает упрямым,
   придает большое значение правилам морали. Во всем стремится к комфорту.

   Каштану очень трудно найти взаимопонимание с другими, поэтому иногда он
   имеет славу недобросовестного человека. Возможно, это связано с его
   страстью к шокированию других. Он требует большой любви, но сам может
   любить только однажды в жизни, поэтому ему трудно найти его счастье.
   Потребность в любви и одновременный страх перед беззащитной любовью делают
   его отношения очень трудными.

   Его комплексы ведут к провокационному поведению, которое часто непонятно
   для других.

  Ясень

   Несомненно, могучее дерево. Он элегантен и свободен в движениях.
   Самовлюблен и требователен. Хочет, чтобы о нем заботились, но сам он в это
   время будет делать только то, чего хочет. А если учесть то, свобода — для
   него главное, выдерживают такое общение далеко не все. Ужасный эгоист, но
   нисколько не скряга.

   К своим целям идет напролом, и не стоит находиться на его пути. Успеха
   ясень добьется в любом случае — это очень сильная натура.

   Однако, этот капризный человек совсем иначе ведет себя в любви —
   становится осмотрительным, постоянным, и очень разумным. Он почти не
   ошибается в выборе партнера и прилагает немало усилий, чтобы наладить свою
   семейную жизнь. Ясень, определенно, способен выстроить образцовый брак.

   Оригинален, отличается необыкновенной интуицией. Имеет дар
   проницательности, любит пророчествовать, и когда его предсказания
   действительно сбываются, тщеславие у ясеня начинает зашкаливать.

  Граб

   Очаровательный и милый внешне, граб совсем не такой внутри. На окружающий
   мир смотрит с некоторым снисхождением. Таких людей всегда интересует не
   сама конфета, а ее обертка. Очень послушный, а подчинение даже любит (в
   хорошем смысле слова), особенно ему нравится следовать установленным
   правилам, возможно, поэтому граб не инициативен.

   Очень боится ошибок, а потому терпеть не может принимать решения. Но за
   свои действия всегда готов нести ответственность. Очень консервативен, не
   любит новшеств.

   В любви эти люди очень честны. Они хорошие спутники жизни. Но если жизнь
   заставит его выбирать между любовью и долгом, он выберет последний.

  Инжир

   В нем нет какой-то особой красоты, но и не заметить его нельзя. Инжир
   немного впечатлительный и имеет свои комплексы, поэтому ему не везде
   бывает хорошо и комфортно. Трудности переживает очень плохо. Будучи
   впечатлительным, сильно подвержен грусти, которая его обязательно погубит.

   У него сильная связь с семьей. Очень эмоциональный, что отражается на его
   душевном спокойствии.

   Даже если инжиру что-то не нравится (а он об этом чаще всего промолчит),
   свои обязанности он все равно выполнит. Ленивый, но работает усердно. На
   этих людей всегда можно опереться.

   В браке с ним хорошо и легко. Но не ждите особой романтики, инжир ценит
   простые чувства без прикрас и лоска. Но, внимание: инжир очень легко
   обидеть!

  Дуб

   Он полон жизни, силы и красоты, в нем совершенно нет хрупкости. Он
   вызывает уважение и восторг, притягивает благодаря своему внушительному
   виду.

   Дуб имеет отличное здоровье, что для него крайне важно, так как болезни
   переносит очень плохо. Весьма храбрый, но его мужество продиктовано,
   скорее, феноменальной гордостью. Дуб не потерпит, чтобы окружающие сочли
   его трусом, а потому, на некоторые ситуации реагирует более жестко, чем
   следовало бы. Весьма последовательный, своих целей, как правило,
   достигает.

   Но есть и обратная сторона: подобная бескомпромиссность не позволяет дубу
   проявлять гибкость, что, конечно, вызывает проблемы. Он бы достигал
   больших успехов, если был бы более дипломатичным.

   Дуб не станет терпеть ограничений, и его действия часто граничат с
   произволом. Тем не менее он уважает мнение других.

   В любви ищет все время что-то новое, а потому часто становится жертвой
   неудачных отношений. Но в браке такой человек может остепениться.

   Дуб не любит перемен, он очень консервативен. Несмотря на свою,
   способность к бескорыстным действиям, о себе он тоже помнит, и всегда
   извлечет собственную выгоду. Жизнь других его мало интересует.

   Такие люди мыслят ясно, своим привычкам не изменяют. Обычно они
   обеспечивают полностью комфортное существования для своей семьи.

  Береза

   Она гибкая, простая и приятная в общении. Очень деликатная, не навязывает
   свое мнение, ни от кого ничего особого не ждет и редко сожалеет о
   чем-либо.

   Береза очень скромна, в ней от природы заложено чувство меры. Толерантна,
   но вот, что бесит березу, так это пошлость. Такие люди лишены всякой
   показухи, они не любят роскошь, в них нет снобизма. Несмотря на свою
   изящную внешность, береза не боится труда и любит работать.

   Предпочитает спокойную и тихую любовь. Однако, сильные яркие чувства ее не
   пугают. В своем доме легко создает уют и комфорт, причем не только для
   себя одной.

   Сила ее воображения и изобретательности просто не имеют границ! Очень
   часто береза выбирает себе творческую профессию. А способность мыслить
   логично и превращать в жизнь мечты, в сочетании с ее продуктивностью,
   открывает для березы все двери.

   Однако, и у таких людей бывают недостатки, и главный — необщительность. Но
   береза счастлива, ей это не мешает. Она так мало требует жизни, что ей
   достаточно, чтобы у нее был любящий человек рядом и хорошая библиотека под
   рукой.

  Олива

   Небольшая, иногда на грани красоты и уродства, но не лишенная своей
   прелести. Олива часто беспокоится о ревматизме, поэтому ей нравится солнце
   и она очень страдает от его отсутствия.

   Олива знает, что и у других может быть свое собственное мнение, а потому
   никогда не вмешивается в жизни людей. Деликатна до такой степени, что ее
   иногда обвиняют в равнодушии. Напротив, в случае необходимости к ней легко
   можно обратиться за помощью.

   В любой ситуации улыбается. Отчасти это связано с умением контролировать
   себя, но прежде всего из-за того, что нужно беречь нервную систему.

   Имеет врожденное чувство справедливости. Всегда может поставить себя на
   место других. Поэтому ее любят и ценят, хотя она ничего не делает, чтобы
   произвести впечатление на окружающих. Общается сдержанно.

   В любви олива пытается не ревновать, уважает независимость партнера, даже
   если это причиняет страдания. Но это не делает ее слабой. Просто, самое
   важное для нее — покой. Несмотря на то, что она не стремится к этому, она
   всегда привлекает внимание к себе и иногда может стать знаменитой.

   Это одни из тех людей, которые приносят отдых и счастье другим, оставляя
   после себя приятные воспоминания.

  Бук

   Он стройный и красивый, причем свою хорошую форму, величественный силуэт,
   ловкость и гибкость движений способен сохранить до старости. Всегда
   заботится о внешнем виде, и не лишен некоторого кокетства. Если попадает в
   хорошие условия — достигает успеха в любой области. Полон различных
   планов, которые может успешно реализовать. Не позволяет никому и ничему
   увести его с выбранного пути. Может хорошо устроить свою жизнь.

   Бук способен на щедрость, хотя обычно он бережливый и правильно
   организовывает свой бюджет. Не любит делиться своим имуществом. Бук —
   приличное создание, у него много хороших привычек, он всегда взвешивает
   все за и против, никогда не полагается на удачу.

   В любви ему не хватает фантазии, но супруг он идеальный. Стремится к тому,
   чтобы иметь детей, любит обустраивать свой дом.

   Умный, обладает определенными талантами и здравым смыслом. Материалист,
   сначала хочет стать богатым, а после этого, если возможно, счастливым.

   Как видите, галльский гороскоп — очень интересен. И весьма разнопланов,
   тут мы описали лишь его часть.

                           Высадить 60 тысяч деревьем

   Высадить 60 тысяч деревьем
   1 сентября 2023
   Министерство природных ресурсов и экологии Свердловской области определило
   первые участки в региональных лесничествах для проведения акции «Сохраним
   лес». Для проведения посадочных работ выделены 13 территорий общей
   площадью 24,2 гектара в Алапаевском, Верхнетуринском, Ивдельском,
   Ирбитском, Карпинском, Серовском, Таборинском и Талицком районах, где
   запланировано высадить около 60 тысяч деревьев.
   В 2023 году всероссийская акция «Сохраним лес» пройдет в пятый раз.
   Мероприятия, помогающие сохранять и восстанавливать леса проводятся в
   рамках национального проекта «Экология».
   «Свердловская область никогда не остается в стороне при проведении акции
   «Сохраним лес». Участие в ней принимают тысячи уральцев – сотрудники
   лесничеств, работники предприятий, члены общественных организаций,
   волонтёры. В этом году будут высажены саженцы ели, кедра, сосны, липы и
   дуба», – рассказал министр природных ресурсов и экологии Свердловской
   области Денис Мамонтов.
   Самый большое количество деревьев планируется высадить Верхнетуринском
   городском округе. Там для проведения акции «Сохраним лес» выделено три
   участка общей площадью 10,8 гектара, на которых появятся 27,1 тысячи
   саженцев ели.
   Отметим, в регионе используется собственный посадочный материал,
   выращенный в питомниках из заготовленных уральских семян. Всего в 2023
   году будет восстановлено более 30 тысяч гектаров свердловских лесов.
   Специалисты Уральской авиалесоохраны, лесничеств и арендаторы проведут
   лесовосстановительные работы на местах плановых вырубок и площадях,
   пострадавших от лесных пожаров.
   Почти семь тысяч гектаров займут сеянцы сосен и елей – их высадят в том
   числе и на местах, где ранее деревья полностью погибли. Лесовостановление
   на таких участках начинается минимум через год после пожаров – площади
   перед высадкой деревьев необходимо обследовать и подготовить.
   Напомним, акция «Сохраним лес» – это масштабный всероссийский
   лесовосстановительный проект, направленный на восстановление зелёных
   насаждений, погибших вследствие пожаров, вырубок или других негативных
   факторов. Впервые акцию «Сохраним лес» провели в 2019 году. С того момента
   к ней присоединилось шесть миллионов участников, которые высадили более
   222 миллионов деревьев. Экологическая инициатива стала по праву считаться
   одной из крупнейших в России.
   Принять участие в акции может любой желающий – достаточно зайти на сайт
   сохранимлес.рф, найти свой регион, зарегистрироваться на событие и быть на
   месте в назначенное время.

    Крым

   498 тысяч человек остались без света в Крыму из-за отключений линий
   электропередачи в результате шторма, который пришел на юг Украины
   и в приграничные российские регионы 26 ноября, сообщил советник главы
   аннексированного полуострова Олег Крючков. Самые пострадавшие районы
   полуострова — Черноморский, Сакский, Белогорский, Симферопольский,
   Октябрьский, Бахчисарайский, Ленинский. На территории некоторых
   муниципальных образований объявлен режим чрезвычайной ситуации.

   Жители Черноморского района остались без воды и теплоснабжения. В Саках
   произошла авария на газопроводе. Из-за падения опоры электропередач
   перекрыта дорога между селами Митяево и Трудовое Сакского района. Еще
   несколько участков дорог на полуострове подтопило. В Севастополе ветром
   повалило 189 деревьев и сорвало рекламные щиты. В городе повреждены кровли
   42 домов. От падения деревьев и конструктивных элементов зданий пострадало
   42 автомобиля. Затопило один из залов местного морского аквариума-музея,
   погибло более 500 морских животных. Директор аквариума накануне сообщал,
   что погибли 800 животных.

   По предварительным данным властей аннексированного Крыма, один человек
   погиб в районе Судака. Во время шторма он вышел смотреть на волны. В МЧС
   сообщили о пропавшем без вести и четверых пострадавших. Минздрав
   РФ сообщил о семи пострадавших в Евпатории. В Севастополе пострадали три
   человека. Точное число пострадавших на полуострове сейчас неизвестно.

     Обновление. Один человек погиб и 10 пострадали из-за непогоды в Крыму,
     уточнили в МЧС России. Более 350 человек эвакуированы. Еще два человека
     погибли во время шторма в Сочи, сообщили оперштаб Краснодарского края
     и управление МВД по региону.

   В Евпатории, где море вышло из берегов, спасатели эвакуировали 142
   человека из 40 подтопленных домов и приусадебных участков. Еще 100 человек
   эвакуированы из отеля «Рибера», который находится на побережье.
   В нескольких районах Крыма повреждена курортная инфраструктура. Сотрудники
   МЧС вывозят людей из подтопленных домов и в других частях полуострова.

   Накануне глава аннексированного Крыма Сергей Аксенов объявил понедельник
   выходным днем для жителей региона. В Севастополе 27 ноября не будут
   работать школы, детские сады и учреждения социальной сферы. Общественный
   транспорт на полуострове также будет работать в режиме выходного дня.
   Жителей Крыма попросили не выезжать на дороги на личном транспорте.
   В регионе действует штормовое предупреждение из-за ураганного ветра
   порывами до 40 метров в секунду.

    Краснодарский край

   Шторм сорвал с якоря сухогруз под флагом Белиза, находившийся под
   погрузкой ячменя для Египта в морском порту Тамань. Судно дрейфовало около
   двух часов, пока его не выбросило на мель в районе Анапы. На борту
   находился 21 член экипажа — граждане Сирии, Индии и Египта. О пострадавших
   не сообщается.

   В Сочи и Адлере ветром повалило деревья. Из-за сильного ветра и высоких
   волн в Сочи закрыты пляжи. 10 самолетов, следовавших в аэропорт Сочи, ушли
   на запасные аэродромы в Минеральные Воды. Позже они вернулись в аэропорт
   Сочи. 26 ноября на одну из контактных линий железнодорожных путей упало
   дерево. Еще одно дерево рухнуло на остановку, где в тот момент находились
   люди. В РЖД сообщили, что из-за непогоды в Краснодарском крае
   задерживаются порядка 50 поездов.

   В школах и детсадах Анапы отменили занятия.

   На Кубани действуют семь штормовых предупреждений. Сильное волнение моря
   наблюдается в Анапе, Геленджике, Новороссийске и Туапсинском районе.
   В 43 муниципалитетах возможны подъемы уровней рек и очень сильный ветер,
   сообщил оперативный штаб региона. В Сочи ожидается сильный снег.

    Самопровозглашенные ДНР и ЛНР, аннексированная Запорожская область

   22 населенных пункта в самопровозглашенной ЛНР остались без света из-за
   непогоды.

   В самопровозглашенной ДНР электричество отключено у 525 тысяч абонентов.
   В регионе ветер повалил деревья и оборвал линии электропередачи. Несколько
   населенных пунктов остались без воды. В Донецке обесточены 214 котельных
   и 20 подстанций, электричества также нет примерно у 190 тысяч абонентов.

   В захваченной РФ части Запорожской области электроснабжения нет у 37 тысяч
   абонентов. Пять районов Бердянска подтоплены. Средний уровень воды
   достигает 40 сантиметров.

    Одесская область

   В Одесской области, куда шторм пришел 26 ноября, спасатели продолжают
   ликвидировать последствия непогоды, задействовав в числе прочего
   бронетранспортеры. К утру 27 ноября полиция получила сообщения о 71 аварии
   на дорогах, занесенных снегом. В Одессе по состоянию на 7:00 (8:00 мск)
   зафиксировали 78 обрывов контактной сети городского электротранспорта:
   движение большей части трамваев и троллейбусов приостановлено. Вечером
   26 ноября в городе отключили районные котельные. Мэр Одессы Геннадий
   Труханов сообщил, что на территории одной из котельных упала 100-метровая
   труба.

   Все учебные заведения Одесской области перешли на дистанционное обучение.
   Детские сады и школы будут работать в режиме дежурных групп, сообщил
   губернатор региона Олег Кипер.

   Самая сложная ситуация на севере и юге Одесской области, где снежные
   заносы достигают полутора метров, сообщили в МВД Украины. В селе Удобное
   под Одессой пограничники эвакуировали из автобусов 42 человека, в том
   числе 10 детей. На трассе Измаил — Рени спасатели освободили шесть
   человек. Еще шесть человек обратились к врачам с признаками
   переохлаждения. Всего из-за непогоды были отбуксированы более 500 единиц
   автотранспорта, в том числе 14 автобусов и 12 автомобилей экстренной
   помощи.

   Из-за непогоды по всей Украине обесточены 2019 населенных пунктов в 16
   областях, перекрыто движение по 14 дорогам, отбуксировано 840 автомобилей.
   В МВД Украины призвали водителей избегать поездок по регионам, куда пришел
   шторм и ураганы.

     * По делу о спиленном «дереве Робин Гуда» задержали 16-летнего подростка —
     и отпустили. Затем задержали мужчину старше 60 лет — и тоже отпустили

   12:13, 2 октября 2023
   Источник: The Chronicle

   Второй подозреваемый по уголовному делу, которое возбудили после
   уничтожения легендарного «дерева Робин Гуда» — белого клена в графстве
   Нортумберленд — вышел под залог. Об этом сообщает газета The Chronicle.

   Подозреваемого в преднамеренном акте вандализма — мужчину «старше 60
   лет» — задержали в минувшую пятницу, 29 сентября. Его имя не раскрывалось.
   Полиция сообщила о его задержании в день, когда первый фигурант дела —
   16-летний подросток — вышел под залог.

   В сети появились предположения, что дерево спилил бывший дровосек,
   69-летний Уолтер Ренвик, который недавно лишился прав на недвижимость,
   но Ренвик заявил The Sun, что не причастен к случившемуся.

   Белый клен стоял в национальном парке Нортумберленд в лощине «Сикамор-гэп»
   рядом с валом Адриана. Клен прозвали «деревом Робин Гуда», поскольку рядом
   с ним снимали некоторые сцены фильма «Робин Гуд — принц воров» 1991 года
   с Кевином Костнером в главной роли. Дерево, считавшееся одной из самых
   известных достопримечательностей Англии, спилили в ночь на 28 сентября.

    На севере Англии спилили знаменитое «дерево Робин Гуда» — ему несколько
    столетий. Задержан 16-летний подросток. Зачем он это сделал, неизвестно

   Британская полиция задержала 16-летнего подростка, подозреваемого в том,
   что он спилил белый клен в национальном парке графства Нортумберленд
   на севере Англии. Это дерево называют одной из самых известных
   достопримечательностей страны, сообщает «Би-би-си». Огромный клен
   несколько столетий рос в лощине «Сикамор-гэп» рядом с валом Адриана и был
   особенно почитаем местными жителями и туристами как важный и знаковый
   элемент ландшафта. Его также называли «деревом Робин Гуда» — рядом с этим
   кленом снимались некоторые сцены фильма «Робин Гуд — принц воров» 1991
   года с Кевином Костнером в главной роли. Полиция считает случившееся
   «преднамеренным актом вандализма». Задержанный подросток сотрудничает
   со следствием, однако его мотивы пока не ясны.

  В Марий Эл во время урагана деревья завалили палаточный лагерь с туристами.
                  Погибли восемь человек, больше 20 пострадали

   По последним данным, восемь человек погибли и 29 человек пострадали из-за
   урагана на озере Яльчик в Республике Марий Эл, сообщает РИА Новости
   со ссылкой на МЧС России. Из-за урагана госпитализированы 16 человек. Мэр
   Йошкар-Олы Евгений Маслов заявил, что двое пострадавших находятся
   в тяжелом состоянии.

   На озере Яльчик деревья упали на палаточный лагерь, который стоял на диком
   пляже, заявил глава Марий Эл Юрий Зайцев. По его словам, среди погибших —
   трое детей. Туристическая группа не была зарегистрирована в спасательных
   службах, заявили в МЧС.

   МЧС России

   В туристическом лагере на берегу озера Яльчик, как пишет «Подъем»
   со ссылкой на спасателей, в момент происшествия находилось до 500
   автомобилей. После начала урагана многие люди попытались выехать из леса,
   но упавшие деревья перегородили дорогу. По словам очевидцев, женщин
   и детей из палаток отводили ближе к берегу озера, чтобы они не попали под
   падающие деревья.

   Следственный комитет РФ уточнил, что озера Малый Яльчик и Большой Яльчик,
   где упали деревья, расположены на территории национального парка «Марий
   Чодра». Управление СК по Марий Эл возбудило уголовное дело «по факту
   оказания руководством ФГБУ «Национальный парк «Марий Чодра» услуг,
   не отвечающих требованиям безопасности», что привело к гибели людей (часть
   3 статьи 238 УК). 

   Вечером 29 июля ураган прошел в восьми регионах Приволжского федерального
   округа, в том числе в Марий Эл. Порывы ветра достигали 27 метров
   в секунду. В 520 населенных пунктах с населением почти 100 тысяч человек
   упало более 550 деревьев, повреждены крыши 41 жилого дома и семи
   социальных объектов, сообщили в МЧС. По данным ведомства на 7:32 утра,
   в Приволжском федеральном округе из-за урагана погибли десять человек,
   более 65 пострадали. В Татарстане дерево упало на туристическую палатку,
   из-за чего погиб ребенок.

     Обновление. В материал добавлены последние данные о погибших
     и пострадавших по состоянию на 12:45.

     * Кадр из анимационного фильма «Студенческий городок»
   истории

На Берлинале в этом году как никогда много анимации Новый Макото Синкай (главный
  преемник Миядзаки), мультфильм о войне в Иране и история о будущем, где люди
                         обязаны превращаться в деревья

   13:30, 23 февраля 2023
   Источник: Meduza

   Berlinale

   В 2023 году Берлинский фестиваль уделил непривычно много внимания
   анимации. В основной конкурс включены сразу два полнометражных
   мультфильма, оба из Азии — «Судзумэ закрывает двери» японца Макото Синкая
   и «Студенческий городок» китайца Лю Цзяня. В конкурс Encounters включена
   венгерская научная фантастика «Белое пластиковое небо», в «Панораму» —
   антивоенная иранская «Сирена». Все эти картины роднит исследование
   прошлого, отзывающегося в настоящем, и попытки предсказать отнюдь
   не светлое будущее. 

  «Сирена»

   The Siren. Режиссер — Сепиде Фарси. Франция

   Берлинале принципиально отказался в этом году приглашать фильмы из Ирана,
   снятые при государственном участии (например, именно таким был один
   из лауреатов «Золотого медведя» за последние годы — «Развод Надера
   и Симин» Асгара Фархади). Зато анимационной «Сирене», сделанной
   эмигранткой из Ирана Сепиде Фарси во Франции, доверили открытие программы
   «Панорама».

  Почему Берлинале игнорирует Иран

     * «Мы хотим забрать нашу страну у этих странных и тупых людей» Репортаж
       «Медузы» из Ирана. Сотни тысяч людей несколько месяцев протестовали
       против авторитарного режима, но так и не смогли победить — по крайней
       мере пока

   Сюжет связан с ирано-иракской войной, темой болезненной, табуированной
   и жестко контролируемой цензурой — в частности, в Иране невозможно
   распространение каких-либо ее съемок, если они не санкционированы
   государством. Многие именитые режиссеры, в том числе Джафар Панахи,
   пытались снять игровые фильмы об этой войне, но не смогли получить
   разрешения. 

   Фарси была девочкой, когда в 1980-м, всего через год после революции,
   начались военные действия. Отец режиссера умер в 2022-м, фильм посвящен
   его памяти. В детстве, после окончания войны, он возил ее в город Абадан —
   южный порт, фактически уничтоженный тогда иракской авиацией и артиллерией.
   Теперь постановщица «Сирены» в своем фильме одновременно отдает дань
   прошлому и выражает протест против официозной лжи. Анимация, к которой
   Фарси — автор игровых и документальных картин — прибегает впервые в жизни,
   помогает ей обойти нехватку материала: если его невозможно добыть,
   придется нарисовать. Схожим образом поступала со своими воспоминаниями
   Маржан Сатрапи, когда делала знаменитый «Персеполис».

   Berlinale — Berlin International Film Festival

   Невозможно игнорировать и еще один аспект, пусть не запланированный
   авторами. Картина о подростках, играющих в футбол на пустыре, которых
   внезапно прерывает бомбардировка жилых кварталов, отзывается свежими
   впечатлениями о событиях в Украине. Стойкость и находчивость 14-летнего
   Омида, главного героя «Сирены», напоминает о десятках подлинных историй,
   случившихся вовсе не 40 с лишним лет назад, а в последние месяцы. Фильм
   Фарси говорит с сегодняшним днем, используя прошлое лишь в качестве
   инструмента.

   Поэтичная ткань «Сирены» сложена из многослойных визуальных образов
   (художник и соавтор — Завен Наджар) и сновидческих джазовых мелодий
   французского трубача Эрика Трюффаза, что не мешает картине быть еще
   и увлекательным триллером.

   Подросток после бегства матери с младшими детьми остался в Абадане
   с дедушкой и ждет с фронта старшего брата. Развозя на своем мотоцикле
   горячие обеды буквально под пулями, Омид мечтает заработать на петушиных
   боях, для чего тренирует своего петуха Шир Хана. Знакомство с несколькими
   необычными людьми — знаменитой дивой, которой после революции запрещены
   публичные выступления, старым инженером, живущим в окружении котов,
   запершимся в своем ателье фотографом, священниками из армянской церкви —
   убеждает мальчика, что отдавать «патриотический долг», погибая
   на бессмысленной войне, вовсе не обязательно. Ему в голову приходит
   невероятная идея: отремонтировать старый корабль пропавшего когда-то
   в море отца (это судно и называется «Сирена»), чтобы вывезти
   из обреченного города всех, кто ему дорог, людей и животных. Его личный
   Ноев ковчег. 

   Антивоенный и наполненный стоическим оптимизмом мультфильм Фарси — еще
   и тонкий роман воспитания о первой любви и умении совершить выбор
   в невыносимо тяжелых обстоятельствах. 

  «Белое пластиковое небо»

   White Plastic Sky. Режиссер — Тибор Баноцки и Шаролта Сабо. Венгрия

   «Сирена» погружает в прошлое, «Белое пластиковое небо» — в далекое
   будущее, на сто лет вперед. Соавторы и партнеры, лауреаты множества
   фестивалей короткометражной анимации, Тибор Баноцки и Шаролта Сабо для
   своего полнометражного дебюта взяли за основу худший из возможных
   сценариев для человечества. В их Будапеште 2123 года не осталось
   ни животных, ни растений, почва отравлена, а немногочисленные люди
   вынуждены жить под гигантским куполом — то самое «белое пластиковое небо»
   из названия.

   Кормиться давно нечем, поэтому введен новый закон: дожив до 50 лет, каждый
   человек отдает свое тело обществу. Ученые вживляют в человека особенный
   имплант — выращивают из него дерево, которое используется для питания
   остальными. Все эти детали зрителю сообщают постепенно и ненавязчиво,
   поскольку основной стержень интриги — не социально-политический,
   а романтический. 

   Психолог Штефан всю жизнь убеждает своих пациентов в необходимости
   самопожертвования на благо остальных. Однако, когда его жена Нора, которая
   не в состоянии пережить боль от потери их сына, решает досрочно
   превратиться в дерево, Штефан совершает невозможное. Добыв фальшивые
   документы и проникнув на плантацию, где выращивается питание для выживших,
   он похищает погруженную в сон Нору и отправляется с ней в путешествие —
   на поиск спрятанной в далеких горах лаборатории. Говорят, живущий в ней
   профессор, когда-то и разработавший спасительную схему, способен провести
   сложную операцию и извлечь из обреченного убийственный имплант. 

   IFrame
   Berlinale — Berlin International Film Festival

   Баноцки и Сабо используют различные техники, пытаясь найти в каждой
   из своих экзистенциальных, порой близких к абстракции притч адекватный
   сюжету визуальный язык. В «Белом пластиковом небе» это ротоскопирование —
   Штефан и Нора сыграны живыми актерами, потом обведены и анимированы
   режиссерами (они же продюсеры, сценаристы, художники картины). Возникает
   жутковатый эффект сочетания реалистических героев с кошмарно-безжизненными
   пейзажами придуманного будущего, обладающими грозной красотой забывшей
   о человеке природы. Эстетика мультфильма временами напоминает анимационную
   фантастику восьмидесятых — «Властелинов времени» Рене Лалу или «Навсикаю
   из Долины ветров» Хаяо Миядзаки. Но содержательно и эмоционально «Белое
   пластиковое небо» отражает страхи именно сегодняшние. 

     Внимание! В следующем абзаце — спойлер к финалу «Белого пластикового
     неба».

   Финал может показаться светлым лишь радикальным «зеленым». Штефан и Нора,
   будто новые Адам и Ева, соединяются с древом познания добра и зла, чтобы
   раздеться донага и раствориться в окружающей среде без остатка. Инверсия
   мифа об Эдеме не оставляет ни одной надежды. 

  «Судзумэ закрывает двери»

   Suzume no tojimari. Режиссер — Макото Синкай. Япония

   Феномен японского проката — больше 10 миллионов зрителей только на родине,
   а ведь показы в других странах еще даже не начались. Это новое
   подростковое фэнтези Макото Синкая знаменует окончательное наступление
   творческой зрелости, ощутимое уже в «Твоем имени» и в «Дитя погоды».
   «Судзумэ закрывает двери» — с большим отрывом самый коммерческий фильм
   конкурса Берлинале, но отнюдь не самый поверхностный и ничуть
   не банальный. 

   Синкай по-прежнему виртуозно сочетает тинейджерские сказочные сюжеты
   с экологически-катастрофической повесткой, столь волнующей японских
   зрителей, а фотореализм узнаваемых городских пейзажей подкрашивает
   сюрреалистическими цветами. Его новая героиня Судзумэ — 17-летняя сирота,
   обретающая таинственный (как выясняется впоследствии, предопределенный
   ее сиротством) дар: она способна видеть прорехи в ткани бытия, через
   которые на Землю рвутся стихийные бедствия — черви-разрушители, — и,
   находя таинственные двери и закрывая их, предотвращать землетрясения
   и иные катаклизмы.

   Эсхатологический размах никак не препятствует ни трогательной истории
   первой любви, ни взявшемуся ниоткуда милому говорящему котику (конечно же,
   в нем живет синтоистский дух, сдерживающий гнев природы и защищающий
   людей), ни закадровой нежной музыке. Лучшая сюрреалистическая деталь
   мультфильма — трехногий детский стульчик, ходячий и говорящий: это
   сообщник, друг и чуть ли не возлюбленный Судзумэ, сопровождающий
   ее во всех приключениях. 

   IFrame

   «Судзумэ закрывает двери» вновь заставит многих сравнивать Синкая
   со старшим товарищем и духовным наставником — великим Хаяо Миядзаки, чей
   новый мультфильм тоже должен выйти в 2023 году. Синкай без стеснения
   цитирует мастера, начиная действие в префектуре Миядзаки и заставляя свою
   героиню зависнуть в воздухе, как Ситу из «Небесного замка Лапута». Однако
   у Синкая собственный язык, стиль и узнаваемая индивидуальная манера.
   Одновременно очень японская и совершенно универсальная — особенно в мире,
   который постоянно трясет и где каждый ощущает себя на краю пропасти. Это
   ощущение анимация Макото Синкая передает чрезвычайно точно, что делает его
   эффектный мультфильм еще и крайне актуальным. 

  «Студенческий городок»

   Da xue cheng. Режиссер — Лю Цзянь. Китай

   Лю Цзянь — единственный режиссер, снимающий в Китае независимое
   анимационное кино, обращенное исключительно ко взрослому зрителю.
   Неформальный лидер китайского авторского кино Цзя Чжанкэ — кстати,
   озвучивший здесь важную роль художника-эмигранта, вернувшегося
   на родину, — небезосновательно считает коллегу гением.

   «Студенческий городок» — третий полный метр Лю, и он радикально отличается
   от двух предыдущих, отмеченных влиянием американского криминального кино
   и саркастического постмодернизма. Это поэтичная, нежная, парадоксальная
   и очевидно автобиографическая мемуаристика о годах юности режиссера,
   проведенных в художественном вузе в девяностых. Недаром картине предпослан
   эпиграф из «Портрета художника в юности» Джеймса Джойса. 

   Среди других имен и персон, обсуждаемых героями фильма — первым поколением
   китайских студентов, получивших доступ к капиталистической цивилизации
   Запада и страстно увлеченных ею, — Дюшан и Кобейн, Сартр и Дебюсси, Ротко
   и Ван Гог, Бетховен и Коппола. Будни молодых людей, пока застенчивых
   и неотесанных, но уже полных амбиций, состоят из предсказуемой рутины: они
   пьют пиво, прогуливают лекции, плюют в потолок, влюбляются,
   разочаровываются, строят невероятные планы на будущее. Одна девочка
   мечтает петь в опере, но пока устраивается в местный бар — ведь там
   неплохо платят. Другая собирается начать карьеру пианистки, но сперва
   выйти замуж за студента из престижного института — ведь он вскоре
   переезжает в Париж. Парень с художественного факультета пытается
   преодолеть в себе традиционалиста и найти новую форму для китайской
   классической живописи — туши на бумаге. А другой, специализирующийся
   на живописи маслом, увлечен недоступной девушкой со своего курса.

   Фрагментарное мозаичное повествование складывается в масштабную,
   но в то же время камерную и интимную фреску о девяностых — эпохе транзита
   из прошлого в будущее, отказа от обветшавших иллюзий во имя неоправданных
   надежд. Точно такой же фильм можно было бы снять о поколении молодежи
   девяностых в постсоветской России, только никто этого пока не сделал.

   С любовью и вниманием к деталям, суховатым юмором и внезапными проблесками
   сновидческой фантазии Лю Цзянь по-прустовски пристально вглядывается
   в ушедшее время. Как можно его восстановить? Выясняется, что на это
   способна именно анимация. Достичь такого уровня правдоподобия
   и одновременно абстракции в игровом кино вряд ли возможно.

   Как замечает один из персонажей, живопись превосходит фотографию — ведь
   лишь она способна ухватить и передать скрытую суть вещей. Именно таков
   мультфильм Лю, в котором даже безлюдные пейзажи с обшарпанными стенами
   домов, палой листвой или ползущими по траве насекомыми будто бы наполнены
   глубокой эмоцией и специфически восточной созерцательностью. 

   Из вороха житейских неурядиц и проходных эпизодов вырастают вопросы, над
   которыми ломают головы герои: как достигнуть подлинной свободы, кто имеет
   право назвать себя художником, кому судить о таланте, какое все это имеет
   отношение к успеху и деньгам? И главное, что такое искусство?
   Исчерпывающий ответ на этот вопрос Лю Цзянь дает своим выдающимся фильмом.
   И это — лучший аргумент в пользу участия анимации в международных
   фестивалях, по-прежнему достаточно редкого.

   столичных магистралей, сообщил мэр Москвы Сергей Собянин.Больше половины
   из них – липы. Деревья красивые и неприхотливые, устойчивые к морозам и
   другим особенностям климата Москвы, отметил градоначальник в личном
   блоге."Хорошо зарекомендовали себя и вязы. Этих благородных деревьев
   планируем высадить порядка 850 штук. А декоративные яблони прекрасны в
   любое время года. Их тоже будет довольно много – почти 450", – цитирует
   Собянина телеканал "Москва 24".Радио Sputnik также сообщало, что в Беговом
   районе Москвы появится новый современный квартал.Такого Telegram-канала,
   как у нас, нет ни у кого. Он для тех, кто хочет делать выводы сам.

                             Дерево (теория графов)

   Материал из Википедии — свободной энциклопедии
   Перейти к навигации Перейти к поиску
   У этого термина существуют и другие значения, см. Дерево (значения).

   Дерево — это связный ациклический граф.^[1] Связность означает наличие
   маршрута между любой парой вершин, ацикличность — отсутствие циклов.
   Отсюда, в частности, следует, что число рёбер в дереве на единицу меньше
   числа вершин, а между любыми парами вершин имеется один и только один
   путь.

   Лес — множество деревьев.

   Ориентированное (направленное) дерево — ацикличный орграф (ориентированный
   граф, не содержащий циклов), в котором только одна вершина имеет нулевую
   степень захода (в неё не ведут дуги), а все остальные вершины имеют
   степень захода 1 (в них ведёт ровно по одной дуге). Вершина с нулевой
   степенью захода называется корнем дерева, вершины с нулевой степенью
   исхода (из которых не исходит ни одна дуга) называются концевыми вершинами
   или листьями.^[2]

Связанные определения[править | править код]

     * Степень вершины — количество инцидентных ей ребер.
     * Концевой узел (лист, терминальная вершина) — узел со степенью 1 (то
       есть узел, в который ведёт только одно ребро; в случае
       ориентированного дерева — узел, в который ведёт только одна дуга и не
       исходит ни одной дуги).
     * Узел ветвления — неконцевой узел.
     * Дерево с отмеченной вершиной называется корневым деревом.
          * m-й ярус дерева T — множество узлов дерева, на уровне m от корня
            дерева.
          * частичный порядок на вершинах: u\prec v, если вершины u и v
            различны и вершина u лежит на (единственной!) элементарной цепи,
            соединяющей корень с вершиной v.
          * корневое поддерево с корнем v — подграф \{v\}\cup \{w\mid v@lt;w\}.
          * В контексте, где дерево предполагается имеющим корень, дерево без
            выделенного корня называется свободным.
     * Уровень узла — длина пути от корня до узла. Можно определить
       рекурсивно:
    1. уровень корня дерева T равен 0;
    2. уровень любого другого узла на единицу больше, чем уровень корня
       ближайшего поддерева дерева T, содержащего данный узел.
     * Остовное дерево (остов) — это подграф данного графа, содержащий все
       его вершины и являющийся деревом. Рёбра графа, не входящие в остов,
       называются хордами графа относительно остова.
     * Несводимым называется дерево, в котором нет вершин степени 2.
     * Лес — множество (обычно упорядоченное), не содержащее ни одного
       непересекающегося дерева или содержащее несколько непересекающихся
       деревьев.
     * Центроид — вершина, при удалении которой размеры получившихся
       компонент связности не превышают {\displaystyle {\dfrac {n}{2}}}
       (половины размера исходного дерева)

Двоичное дерево[править | править код]

   [IMG]Простое бинарное дерево размера 9 и высоты 3, с корнем значения 2.
   Это дерево не сбалансировано и не отсортировано.

   Термин двоичное дерево (применяется так же термин бинарное дерево) имеет
   несколько значений:

     * Неориентированное дерево, в котором степени вершин не превосходят 3.
     * Ориентированное дерево, в котором исходящие степени вершин (число
       исходящих рёбер) не превосходят 2.
     * Абстрактная структура данных, используемая в программировании. На
       двоичном дереве основаны такие структуры данных, как двоичное дерево
       поиска, двоичная куча, красно-чёрное дерево, АВЛ-дерево, фибоначчиева
       куча и др.

N-арные деревья[править | править код]

   N-арные деревья определяются по аналогии с двоичным деревом. Для них также
   есть ориентированные и неориентированные случаи, а также соответствующие
   абстрактные структуры данных.

     * N-арное дерево (неориентированное) — это дерево (обычное,
       неориентированное), в котором степени вершин не превосходят N+1.
     * N-арное дерево (ориентированное) — это ориентированное дерево, в
       котором исходящие степени вершин (число исходящих рёбер) не
       превосходят N.

Свойства[править | править код]

     * Дерево не имеет кратных рёбер и петель.
     * Любое дерево с n вершинами содержит n-1 ребро. Более того, конечный
       связный граф является деревом тогда и только тогда, когда B-P=1, где
       B — число вершин, P — число рёбер графа.
     * Граф является деревом тогда и только тогда, когда любые две различные
       его вершины можно соединить единственной простой цепью.
     * Любое дерево однозначно определяется расстояниями (длиной наименьшей
       цепи) между его концевыми (степени 1) вершинами.
     * Любое дерево является двудольным графом.
     * Любое дерево, множество вершин которого не более чем счётное, является
       планарным графом.
     * Для любых трёх вершин дерева, пути между парами этих вершин имеют
       ровно одну общую вершину.

Подсчёт деревьев[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Теорема Кэли о числе деревьев
     * Число различных деревьев, которые можно построить на n нумерованных
       вершинах, равно n^{{n-2}} (Теорема Кэли^[3]).
     * Производящая функция

                        T(z)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }T_{n}z^{n}

           для числа T_{n} неизоморфных корневых деревьев с n вершинами
           удовлетворяет функциональному уравнению

                        T(z)=z\exp \sum _{r=1}^{\infty }{\frac
                        {1}{r}}T(z^{r}).

     * Производящая функция

                        t(z)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }t_{n}z^{n}

           для числа t_{n} неизоморфных деревьев с n вершинами можно
           представить с помощью перечисляющего ряда для корневых деревьев:

                        t(z)=T(z)-{\frac
                        {1}{2}}\left(T^{2}(z)-T(z^{2})\right).

     * При n\to \infty верна следующая асимптотика

                        t_{n}\sim C\alpha ^{n}/n^{5/2}

           где C и \alpha определённые константы, C=0,534948..., \alpha
           =2,95576....

Кодирование деревьев[править | править код]

     * Дерево можно кодировать наборами из нулей и единиц. Рассмотрим,
       например, укладку дерева на плоскости. Начиная с какой-либо вершины
       будем двигаться по ребрам дерева, сворачивая в каждой вершине на
       ближайшее справа ребро и поворачивая назад в концевых вершинах дерева.
       Проходя по некоторому ребру, записываем {\displaystyle 0} при движении
       по ребру в первый раз и 1 при движении по ребру второй раз (в обратном
       направлении). Если m — число рёбер дерева, то через 2m шагов мы
       вернемся в исходную вершину, пройдя по каждому ребру дважды.
       Полученная при этом последовательность из {\displaystyle 0} и 1 (код
       дерева) длины 2m позволяет однозначно восстанавливать не только само
       дерево D, но и его укладку на плоскости. Произвольному дереву
       соответствуют несколько таких кодов. В частности, из этого способа
       кодирования вытекает следующая грубая оценка на число деревьев с n
       вершинами:

                    t_{n}\leq T_{n}@lt;2^{2n}

   [IMG]
     * Код Прюфера сопоставляет произвольному конечному дереву с n вершинами
       последовательность из n-2 чисел от 1 до n с возможными повторениями.
       Например дерево на рисунке имеет код Прюфера (4,4,4,5). Между
       деpевьями с помеченными вершинами и их кодами Прюфера существует
       взаимно однозначное соответствие. Из кода Прюфера выводится формула
       Кэли.
     * Дерево можно задать в виде стpоки, содержащей символы, помечающие
       вершины деpева, а также открывающие и закрывающие кpуглые скобки.
       Между деpевьями и их линейными скобочными записями существует взаимно
       однозначное соответствие.

   Самые старые деревья на планете

Самые старые деревья на планете

   Недавно группа специалистов под руководством Лейфа Куллмана обследовала
   растущую в Швеции канадскую ель.

   Канадская ель

    

   На вид дерево молодое и стройное, однако оно является новым побегом, то
   есть фактически «клоном», росшей на этом месте древней ели, которой уже
   больше 9550 лет. Таким образом, это сейчас самое старое отдельное дерево
   на нашей планете. Неподалеку от него возвышаются и другие клоны, корням
   которых 5660 и 9000 лет.

   Самой древней на Земле  признана и колония тополей в штате Юта (США). Этот
   единый организм, состоящий почти из пятидесяти тысяч генетически
   идентичных деревьев, имеющих общую корневую систему, постоянно
   воспроизводит себя, обеспечивая собственное бессмертие.

   Колония тополей в штате Юта

   Относительно возраста колонии ученые пока не пришли к единому мнению.
   Некоторые полагают, что дерево-основатель проросло более 80 тысяч лет
   назад, другие же считают, что возраст этого гигантского организма с общим
   весом в шесть с лишним тысяч тонн превышает 800 тысяч лет.

   Трагически закончилась судьба сосны вида Pinus longaeva по имени Прометей
   (Prometheus). Это самое старое из известных неклонированных деревьев, к
   сожалению, было спилено в 1964 году работниками Федерального лесного
   управления США в ходе научных изысканий некоего соискателя степени
   магистра.

   Прометей (Prometheus)

   Уже после гибели реликта было точно установлено, что его возраст составлял
   около 5000 лет. Сосна росла в штате Невада на северо-восточном склоне горы
   Уилера в Национальном парке «Грейт Бейсин».

   Еще одна сосна того же вида была обнаружена в штате Калифорния, в
   Национальном лесу «Иньо».

   Мафусаил (Methuselah)

   При ее изучении в 1957 году специалисты точно определили, что она проросла
   в 2832 году до нашей эры, а стало быть, ее возраст к тому моменту
   составлял 4789 лет. Дерево названо Мафусаил (Methuselah) по имени одного
   из библейских персонажей, который прожил 969 лет. Сейчас, после гибели
   Прометея, эта сосна считается самым старым индивидуальным
   (неклонированным) живым организмом на нашей планете. Ради безопасности
   местонахождение долгожителя сохраняется в тайне.

   В Иране, в провинции Язд (Yazd), обнаружен кипарис, получивший имя
   Сарв-э-Абарку (Sarv-e-Abarqu).

   Сарв-э-Абарку (Sarv-e-Abarqu)

   Иногда его также называют Зороатрина Сарв (Zoroatrina Sarv). Возраст
   дерева, по прикидкам специалистов, составляет около 4000 лет.

   Тис в возрасте приблизительно 4000 лет растет во дворе приходской церкви в
   селе Ллангернью (Llangernyw) в Уэльсе.

   Ллангернью (Llangernyw)

   В июне 2002 года по случаю празднования «золотого юбилея» королевы
   Елизаветы II этот реликт признан национальным достоянием Великобритании.

   Фицройя кипарисовидная ( Fitzroya cupressoides) считается вторым после
   Мафусаила деревом-долгожителем на Земле, чей возраст был точно определен в
   1993 году при подсчете годовых колец.

   Алерке (Alerce)

   Ей 3622 года, она растет на юге Чили в береговом заказнике. В тропических
   дождевых лесах находится и много других древних деревьев этого вида,
   которые здесь называют Алерке (Alerce).

   Самый большой и самый древний в США кипарис вида Taxodium distichum по
   имени Сенатор (Senator) находится в Парке Больших Деревьев (Big Tree Park)
   во Флориде.

   Сенатор (Senator)

   Назван кипарис в честь сенатора штата М. О. Оверстрита, который отдал это
   дерево и окружающий участок земли под устройство парка. Возраст Сенатора
   составляет сейчас 3400-3500 лет.

   Среди других деревьев-долгожителей можно вспомнить можжевеловое дерево в
   штате Юта.

   Можжевеловое дерево в штате Юта

   Его возраст первоначально оценили в 3200 лет, а сейчас снизили до 1500.

   Оливковое дерево на Крите

   Оливковому дереву на Крите (на снимке вверху) – 2000 лет. До сих пор дают
   плоды две оливы на Аравийском полуострове и пять в Израиле, достигшие
   примерно 3000 лет. Олива на Сардинии чуть постарше – ей от 3000 до 4000
   лет. Возраст растущего в Бразилии дерева абарко (Cariniana legalis),
   которое прозвали «Красавец-патриарх» (Patriarca da Floresta), оценивается
   в 3000 лет (на снимке внизу).

   «Красавец-патриарх» (Patriarca da Floresta)

   Ведется поиск и других деревьев-долгожителей, для определения их возраста
   делаются особые надрезы. К сожалению, у некоторых видов годовые кольца
   отсутствуют или слабо выражены, и оценить, сколько им лет, пока
   невозможно.

   Топ-10 самых известных деревьев в мире, по версии свободной энциклопедии –
   Википедия.

    1.   1. Бодхи, город Анурадхапура — самое знаменитое и самое старое на
            Шри-Ланке дерево, это дерево было выращено из семени дерева Шри
            Маха Бодхи на Шри Ланке, которое, в свою очередь, произошло от
            оригинального дерева Махабодхи, под которым Будда нашёл
            Просветление.

    1.   1. Дерево Тенере, акация, считавшаяся в своё время самым одиноким
            деревом на Земле.

    1.   1. Гиперион (секвойя), самая высокая из известных деревьев –
            секвойя, достигает высоты 115,5 м растет на западном побережье
            Америки – это самое высокое дерево в мире.

   Гиперион (секвойя)

    1.   1. Дуб кайзера, знаменитый дуб в берлинском районе Фриденау,
            охраняемый памятник природы, посаженный 22 марта 1879 г. в честь
            императора (кайзера) Вильгельма I по случаю золотой свадьбы с его
            супругой Августой Саксонско-Веймарско-Айзенахской и 82-летия
            кайзера. В то время было принято сажать деревья в честь кайзера.

                        10 интересных фактов о деревьях

   Деревья сопровождают нас всегда и везде. Важно помнить, что дерево – не
   только очень ценный природный материал, но и один из самых крупных живых
   организмов нашей планеты. Мы собрали для вас интересные факты, которые вы
   могли не знать.

   1) Леса Финляндии занимают примерно 70% площади страны, в то время как
   доля леса в Великобритании составляет около 6%. Такая ситуация сложилась
   из-за периода промышленной революции;

   2) Секвойя – самое высокое дерево на планете, однако её древесина не особо
   пригодна для бытовых нужд из-за своей хрупкости;

   3) Не все деревья безобидны – сок манцинеллового дерева токсичен, а его
   пары могут негативно повлиять на глаза и дыхательную систему человека (в
   наших широтах вы вряд ли его встретите);

   4) В северном полушарии растёт больше 100 видов сосны, а в южном, до
   недавнего времени, всего 1 (пока не появились искусственно посаженные
   сосновые леса);

   5) В Бразилии растёт «нефтяное дерево» – копаифера. Состав его сока
   практически ничем не отличается от дизельного топлива;

   6) Почти половина всех хвойных деревьев находится на территории России;

   7) В среднем за жизнь дерево поглощает порядка тонны углекислого газа;

   8) Корица – высушенная кора деревьев из Южной Индии и Шри-Ланки;

   9) «Железная» берёза или берёза Шмидта – дерево, которое у вряд ли
   получится срубить топором;

   10) Самое большое дерево – «Генерал Шерман» находится в "Гигантском лесу"
   Калифорнии. Его высота составляет 83,8м, а возраст – 2300-2700 лет.

                       Самые интересные факты о деревьях

     * [ Submit ][ Submit ]

   Деревья – одни из важнейших живых организмов на нашей планете. Их
   интересно наблюдать, рядом с ними приятно гулять, а еще интересно узнавать
   невероятные факты. В нашей подборке – десять интересных сведений о
   деревьях.

   Деревьев не существовало 90% времени жизни планеты

   Большую часть истории планеты, которая насчитывает 4,5 миллиарда лет,
   деревьев не существовало. Они появились 470 миллионов лет назад в виде мха
   без прочных корней, а первые сосудистые растения появились 420милионов лет
   назад и не росли выше 1 метра.

   В процессе эволюции деревьям пришлось «учиться» расти на стволе и
   развивать систему передачи питательных веществ от корня. Считается, что
   первыми такими растениями были папоротниковые, которые не имели листьев.

   Дерево юрского периода

   Волемия благородная – вечнозеленое дерево, которое растет на 25-40 метров
   в высоту. Его остатки находили в окаменелостях Юрского периода и считали
   вымершим более 150 миллионов лет назад. Однако в 1994 году деревья этого
   вида обнаружили в одном из национальных парков Австралии. Сегодня на
   планете сохраняется около 80 взрослых деревьев этого вида.

   На планете существует более 60 тысяч видов деревьев

   В 2017 году группа ученых собрала в единый каталог все данные из музеев,
   ботанических садов и агрокультурных центров по всему миру. Таким образом,
   было установлено, что сегодня на планете существует 60065 видов деревьев,
   известных науке.

   Более половины видов деревьев – эндемики

   Кроме количества известных видов, ученые также исследовали, где и как они
   растут. Оказывается, что около 58% всех видов деревьев – эндемичные, то
   есть распространены на территории только одного региона или страны.
   Лидерами по количеству эндемичных видов стали Бразилия, Колумбия и
   Индонезия.

   Целый лес из одной осины

   В заповеднике Fishlake National Forest (штат Юта, США), растет целый лес,
   имеющий единую корневую систему. Пандо (англ. Pando) – это клональная
   колония отдельного дерева, о чем свидетельствуют исследования ДНК.
   Насаждения занимают площадь в 43,6 гектара, а общий вес деревьев по
   оценкам мог бы составлять 6,6 тысяч тонн. Возраст корневой системы Пандо
   оценивается в 80 тысяч лет, что делает его одной из самых древних живых
   организмов.

   Дерево со взрывающимися плодами

   Дерево Гура (Hura Crepitans), известное также как хурма виргинская,
   распространено в тропических лесах Южной Америки узнаваемо по своей
   гладкой светлой коре, покрытой острыми прямым шипами. Оно может вырастать
   до 60 метров в высоту и выращивать листья до 60 сантиметров. Самая
   известная особенность Гуры – ее плоды, которые, созрев, могут взрываться и
   стрелять семенами со скоростью до 70 метров в секунду в радиусе до 100
   метров.

   Наиболее ядовитое дерево на планете

   Дерево манцинелы (Hippomane mancinella) считают самым ядовитым деревом из
   известных на сегодня – его сок из коры, листьев или плодов содержит
   большое количество токсинов. Даже просто стоять под деревом во время дождя
   не стоит – капли воды с соком листьев вызовут сильную аллергическую
   реакцию на коже. Известны даже случаи, когда повреждалась краска на
   автомобилях.

   Гипотеза Да Винчи

   Леонардо Да Винчи предполагал, что толщина всех ветвей кроны дерева всегда
   равна толщине его ствола. Проще говоря, если «причесать» вверх все ветви и
   сжать их, они будут иметь такую же толщину как ствол дерева. Ученый из
   университета Прованса во Франции методом компьютерного моделирования
   доказал, что это предположение может быть истинным.

   Собственный тропический лес

   Индийский лесовод Джадав Паенг начал высаживать деревья на песчаном
   пустыре, когда ему было 16 лет. Сейчас индийцу 47 и он имеет собственный
   тропический лес площадью 550 гектаров. По подтвержденным данным здесь
   проживают бенгальские тигры, индийские носороги, слоны, олени, обезьяны и
   различные виды птиц.

   Фундамент Венеции

   Фундаментом Венецианских островов служат плотно расположенные деревянные
   сваи из ольхи. Благодаря тому, что древесина остается погруженной в воду,
   она не гниет и не трухнет уже более тысячи лет. Более того, благодаря
   минералам, содержащиеся в воде, сваи постепенно каменеют.

   В 2015 году ученые подсчитали, что на нашей планете растет не менее 3
   триллионов деревьев. Рекордсменом по их количеству является Россия, т.к. у
   нас их насчитывается не менее 640 млрд.

   Известно более 60 тыс. видов деревьев. Их можно разделить на хвойные,
   вечнозеленые, и лиственные. В свою очередь, вторые делятся на
   широколиственные (ясень, бук, клен), листопадные и вечнозеленые. Если вы

10. Лес – легкие планеты

   Примерно треть всей суши занимают леса. Растениям необходима энергия
   света, чтобы синтезировать органические вещества. Этот процесс называется
   фотосинтезом. Побочным его продуктом является кислород.

   Только благодаря растениям мы можем дышать, т.к. именно они производят 99%
   кислорода, и лишь 1% поступает из мантии нашей планеты. Ночью, когда
   процесс фотосинтеза невозможен, деревья и другие растения начинают
   потреблять кислород, но расходуют они его в меньших количествах, чем
   производят.

   Выработкой кислорода занимаются не только деревья, но и все растения,
   населяющие нашу планету, в том числе и микроскопические водоросли,
   образующие фитопланктон.

9. Общая площадь лесов на Земле составляет почти треть поверхности суши

   Лес на нашей планете занимает около 38 млн. км², т.е. деревья занимают
   около трети всей суши. К началу XXI века люди уничтожили около 50% лесов,
   существовавших на планете. Они попытались как-то компенсировать тот ущерб,
   что нанесли природе, и высадили новые леса, но они занимают не более 7 %
   всей территории, отведенной для деревьев.

   Леса нужно возрождать, т.к. только благодаря ним очищается воздух, они
   поглощают промышленные загрязнения, многие деревья выделяют фитонциды,
   обладающие бактерицидными свойствами.

   В хвойных лесах практически стерильный воздух. Если чаще бывать на
   природе, повышается иммунитет, улучшается обмен веществ, успокаивается
   нервная система и т.д.

8. Тайга занимает около 79% территории всей России

   Наша страна занимает огромную территорию, и 79% всей этой земли покрыто
   тайгой. Это особая ландшафтная зона с болотистой почвой, где растут
   деревья хвойных пород. Ширина этой полосы – 800 км, но на
   востоке Сибири она становится еще больше – до 2200 км.

   Зима здесь продолжается 10 месяцев. Большинство животных в это время
   впадает в спячку. Зимой температура может опускаться до -60 градусов, а
   летом поднимается до +35 градусов. Тайга богата пушным зверем, здесь можно
   увидеть более 800 видов цветов, 300 разновидностей птиц, некоторые из
   которых занесены в Красную книгу.

7. Самое распространённое в мире лиственное дерево — берёза

   В Северном полушарии, в том числе и на территории России, одним из самых
   распространенных лиственных растений является береза. Насчитывается более
   100 видов березы. Это важнейшая лесообразующая порода, которая может расти
   практически везде, т.к. не требовательна к почве, живет достаточно долго
   (100-120 лет, отдельные деревья доживают до 400 лет), быстро растет, если
   сравнивать с другими.

   Как только в лесу освобождается место из-за вырубок или пожаров, первыми
   его начинают обживать молодые березки, которые в дальнейшем могут быть
   вытеснены елями.

6. Одно из самых твёрдых в мире деревьев — берёза Шмидта

   Другое название этого дерева – береза железная. Она была названа в честь
   ботаника Федора Шмидта, который первым обнаружил этот вид. Встречается не
   так часто, у нас растет только на юге Приморского края, а также
   в Китае, Японии и Корейском полуострове. Она доживает до 350 лет.

   Древесина у березы Шмидта тяжелая и твердая, она тонет в воде, отличается
   особой прочностью. Обычно это высокое дерево, до 25 м, некоторые из них
   вырастают до 35 м, с диаметром ствола от 70 до 80 см. У них бежевая,
   сероватая кора, у молодых саженцев она почти коричневая, а у веток –
   темного, вишневого оттенка.

5. Из одного дерева можно получить около 60 кг бумаги

   Для получения бумаги нужна не древесина, а целлюлоза, для производства
   которой используются некоторые лесные породы.

   Специальные станки убирают с деревьев кору, а само дерево измельчают в
   мелкие щепки. Потом их смешивают с водой и обрабатывают, прессуют,
   отглаживают. Таким способом делают газетную бумагу.

   Если нужна более качественная, целлюлозу необходимо обработать химическими
   материалами. Из таких листов можно печатать тетради или книги.

   Для получения бумаги высшего сорта, древесный материал варят, промывают,
   фильтруют, после чего прессуют, раскатывают и разглаживают, а потом сушат
   при определенной температуре.

4. Самые высокие в мире деревья — секвойи

   Секвойя вечнозеленая родом из Северной Америки. Они могут прожить до 2
   тыс. лет, вырасти до 110 м. Это дерево с конической кроной и
   горизонтальными ветвями, с толстой, до 30 см толщиной, корой
   красно-коричневого цвета. Часто вырастают до 60-90 м.

   Но самым большим деревом на Земле был назван один из экземпляров этого
   дерева, который получил имя «Гиперион». Его высота – 115, 61 м. Оно растет
   в Калифорнии (США), в национальном парке «Редвуд». Его обнаружили в 2006
   году.

3. Сибирь — самое лесное место России

   Сибирь, если не считать Дальний Восток, занимает площадь в 12 млн. кв. км,
   и где-то две трети всей этой территории – таежные леса. Они начинаются в
   Европейской части нашей страны, покрывают весь Урал, Алтай, и всю
   Западную, Восточную Сибирь, захватывая и Дальний Восток. Простираются на 9
   тыс. километров.

   Тайга – это примерно 80% всего лесного фонда нашей страны. Она, как и
   другие леса, занимает почти половину территории нашей страны (45%), а если
   брать мировую площадь лесов – целых 17%. Северное полушарие Земли
   обогащается кислородом благодаря этому лесу.

2. Крона дуба за год вырастает примерно на один метр

   Желуди прорастают очень медленно, т.к. сначала формируется и растет
   корень, а только потом появляется надземная часть.

   Первые несколько лет дуб растет очень медленно. Саженец в 30-50 см длиной
   должен расти 4-6 лет. Именно в таком возрасте его можно пересаживать на
   постоянное место. В 5-7 лет молодой дуб вырастает до 1 м, именно с 5-10
   лет начинается его интенсивный рост.

   Есть некоторые виды дуба, например, краснолистный, который растет быстрее.
   Сказать точно, на сколько именно вытянется конкретное дерево в год,
   сложно, т.к. у каждого растения своя скорость роста. Но в год дуб
   увеличивается примерно на 1 м, т.е. за 10 лет может вырасти на 8-9 м и
   больше.

1. Меньше всего леса среди стран Европы в Великобритании

   Когда-то на территории Великобритании росли огромные лиственные леса.
   Здесь проживали кельты, поклоняющиеся деревьям, особенно дубам, относились
   к ним с почтением и трепетом.

   Но вскоре эти земли завоевали англосаксонские племена, которые стали
   вырубать леса и возделывать землю. Этот процесс продолжался не одно
   столетие, и в результате к концу ХХ века площадь лесов в этой стране
   сократилась до 10% всей территории острова.

   Сейчас там можно встретить смешанные или таежные леса. Самые
   распространенные деревья на этой территории – бук, береза и дуб. В горах
   раскинулись вересковые пустоши, которые стали пастбищами для овец, а также
   встречаются торфяники.

   Равнины – это пашни и луга, они густо заселены. Огромные лесные массивы
   сменили небольшие редколесья. Но, несмотря на это, Англия кажется зеленой
   страной благодаря живым изгородям, лепополосам, различным фермерским
   лесопосадкам.

   Ішов лісом мисливець.
   Раптом йому назустріч — величезний кабан.
   Ну, чоловік не розгубився і бабах у нього з обох стволів.
   Все навколо в диму, ні хріну не видно, а мужик стоїть і думає:
   – Попав я чи не попав?
   Дим розсіюється… він бачить — стоїть кабан:
   – Ну, мужику, ти попав!

   Дерево — одна из наиболее широко распространённых структур данных в
   информатике, эмулирующая древовидную структуру в виде набора связанных
   узлов. Является связным графом, не содержащим циклы. Большинство
   источников также добавляет условие на то, что рёбра графа не должны быть
   ориентированными. В дополнение к этим трём ограничениям, в некоторых
   источниках указывается, что рёбра графа не должны быть взвешенными.

Определения[править | править код]

     * Корневой узел — самый верхний узел дерева (узел 8 на примере).
     * Корень — одна из вершин, по желанию наблюдателя.
     * Лист, листовой или терминальный узел — узел, не имеющий дочерних
       элементов (узлы 1, 4, 7, 13).
     * Внутренний узел — любой узел дерева, имеющий потомков, и таким
       образом, не являющийся листовым узлом (3, 6, 10, 14).

   Дерево считается ориентированным, если в корень не заходит ни одно ребро.

     * Полный сцепленный ключ — идентификатор записи, который образуется
       путём конкатенации всех ключей экземпляров родительских записей
       (групп).

Узлы[править | править код]

   Узел является экземпляром одного из двух типов элементов графа,
   соответствующим объекту некоторой фиксированной природы. Узел может
   содержать значение, состояние или представление отдельной информационной
   структуры или самого дерева. Каждый узел дерева имеет ноль или более
   узлов-потомков, которые располагаются ниже по дереву (по соглашению,
   деревья "растут" вниз, а не вверх, как это происходит с настоящими
   деревьями). Узел, имеющий потомка, называется узлом-родителем относительно
   своего потомка (или узлом-предшественником, или старшим). Каждый узел
   имеет не больше одного предка. Высота узла — это максимальная длина
   нисходящего пути от этого узла к самому нижнему узлу (краевому узлу),
   называемому листом. Высота корневого узла равна высоте всего дерева.
   Глубина вложенности узла равна длине пути до корневого узла.

  Корневые узлы[править | править код]

   Узел, не имеющий предков (самый верхний), называется корневым узлом. Это
   узел, на котором начинается выполнение большинства операций над деревом
   (хотя некоторые алгоритмы начинают выполнение с «листов» и выполняются,
   пока не достигнут корня). Все прочие узлы могут быть достигнуты путём
   перехода от корневого узла по рёбрам (или ссылкам) (согласно формальному
   определению, каждый подобный путь должен быть уникальным). В диаграммах он
   обычно изображается на самой вершине. В некоторых деревьях, например,
   кучах, корневой узел обладает особыми свойствами. Каждый узел дерева можно
   рассматривать как корневой узел поддерева, «растущего» из этого узла.

Поддеревья[править | править код]

   Поддерево — часть древообразной структуры данных, которая может быть
   представлена в виде отдельного дерева. Любой узел дерева T вместе со всеми
   его узлами-потомками является поддеревом дерева T. Для любого узла
   поддерева либо должен быть путь в корневой узел этого поддерева, либо сам
   узел должен являться корневым. То есть поддерево связано с корневым узлом
   целым деревом, а отношения поддерева со всеми прочими узлами определяются
   через понятие соответствующее поддерево (по аналогии с термином
   «соответствующее подмножество»).

Упорядочивание деревьев[править | править код]

   Существует два основных типа деревьев. В рекурсивном дереве или
   неупорядоченном дереве имеет значение лишь структура самого дерева без
   учёта порядка потомков для каждого узла. Дерево, в котором задан порядок
   (например, каждому ребру, ведущему к потомку, присвоены различные
   натуральные числа) называется деревом с именованными рёбрами или
   упорядоченным деревом со структурой данных, заданной перед именованием и
   называемой структурой данных упорядоченного дерева.

   Упорядоченные деревья являются наиболее распространёнными среди
   древовидных структур. Двоичное дерево поиска — одно из разновидностей
   упорядоченного дерева.

Представление деревьев[править | править код]

   Существует множество различных способов представления деревьев. Наиболее
   общий способ представления изображает узлы как записи, расположенные в
   динамически выделяемой памяти с указателями на своих потомков, предков
   (или и тех и других), или как элементы массива, связанные между собой
   отношениями, определёнными их позициями в массиве (например, двоичная
   куча).

  Деревья как графы[править | править код]

   В теории графов дерево — связный ациклический граф. Корневое дерево — это
   граф с вершиной, выделенной в качестве корневой. В этом случае любые две
   вершины, связанные ребром, наследуют отношения «родитель-потомок».
   Несвязный граф, состоящий исключительно из деревьев, называется лесом.

Методы обхода[править | править код]

   Основная статья: Обход дерева

   Пошаговый перебор элементов дерева по связям между узлами-предками и
   узлами-потомками называется обходом дерева. Зачастую операция может быть
   выполнена переходом указателя по отдельным узлам. Обход, при котором
   каждый узел-предок просматривается прежде его потомков, называется
   предупорядоченным обходом или обходом в прямом порядке (pre-order walk), а
   когда просматриваются сначала потомки, а потом предки, то обход называется
   поступорядоченным обходом или обходом в обратном порядке (post-order
   walk). Существует также симметричный обход, при котором посещается сначала
   левое поддерево, затем узел, затем — правое поддерево, и обход в ширину,
   при котором узлы посещаются уровень за уровнем (N-й уровень дерева —
   множество узлов с высотой N). Каждый уровень обходится слева направо.

Общие операции[править | править код]

     * вставка нового элемента в определённую позицию;
     * вставка поддерева;
     * добавление ветви дерева (называется прививкой);
     * нахождение корневого элемента для любого узла;
     * нахождение наименьшего общего предка двух вершин;
     * перебор всех элементов дерева;
     * перебор элементов ветви дерева;
     * поиск изоморфного поддерева;
     * поиск элемента;
     * удаление ветви дерева (называется обрезкой);
     * удаление поддерева;
     * удаление элемента.

Общее применение[править | править код]

     * управление иерархией данных;
     * упрощение поиска информации (см. обход дерева);
     * управление сортированными списками данных;
     * синтаксический разбор арифметических выражений (англ. parsing),
       оптимизация программ;
     * в качестве технологии компоновки цифровых картинок для получения
       различных визуальных эффектов;
     * форма принятия многоэтапного решения (см. деловые шахматы).

   Какие бывают деревья, из чего они состоят и для чего нужны?

   детям о деревьях

   Деревья очищают и увлажняют воздух, создают прохладу, дают плоды.
   Спиленные деревья являются строительным материалом и сырьем: из высушенных
   стволов делают доски, бумагу.

   Деревья бывают дикорастущими: береза, дуб, ель, ива, каштан, клен, липа,
   осина, осина, ольха, сосна, тополь, ясень. Такие деревья растут в парках,
   вдоль дорог, в лесу.

   Еще деревья бывают плодовыми: яблоня, груша, вишня, абрикос, алыча, слива,
   рябина. Такие деревья люди выращивают в саду, ведь они дают вкусные
   съедобные плоды. 

   школьникам о лесе

   В дереве выделяют три основные части: корень, ствол и крона.

   Корень дерева — это, как правило, подземная часть растения. Благодаря
   корню дерево обеспечивается питательными веществами из почвы.

   Ствол дерева служит опорой для кроны, а также осуществляет передачу
   веществ между корнями и кроной. Снаружи ствол покрыт корой.

   Крона дерева — совокупность веток и листьев в верхней части растения.
   Осенью листья многих деревьев приобретает желтые, оранжевые и красные
   оттенки и опадают с деревьев. Но есть и вечнозеленые деревья, например,
   ель и сосна.

   У каждого дерева  -  свои отличительные особенности.

   Береза  - это дерево с  белым, тонким, стройным стволом. Березовые 
   соцветия называют березовыми сережками. Весной из березы получают
   березовый сок.

   Дуб – это мощное дерево, лесной долгожитель, имеет листья округлой формы и
   очень пышную крону. Дуб хорошо узнаваем благодаря его плодам - желудям.

   Клен – это дерево с красивыми листьями, осенью его разноцветные листья
   являются украшением любого парка. Плод клена называется двукрылаткой:
   после созревания он распадается на две половинки (крылатки), которые летят
   по воздуху и переносят семена.

   Яблоня  – самое распространенное садовое дерево. Она очень неприхотлива и
   отлично приживается даже там, где не могут расти другие плодовые деревья.
   Существует очень много сортов яблонь. Плоды яблони -  это яблоки, они
   очень полезны.

               детям о деревьях детям о деревьях детям о деревьях

   Чтобы ребенок уверенно запомнил не только названия деревьев, но и их
   внешний вид, распечатывайте из Интернет их изображения, разрезайте на
   части и предлагайте собирать мозаику. 

   о деревьях детям

   Накануне любой летней прогулки изучите в энциклопедии или в Википедии
   изображение листьев одного только дерева и найдите на прогулке как минимум
   пять деревьев с такими же листочками. Повторяйте эти уроки каждый год,
   изучая внешний вид знакомых деревьев в разное время года. Исследуйте,
   какими семенами размножается дерево весной, цветут ли на нем цветы, как
   выглядят его осенние листья и голые ветки зимой. Знания о деревьях
   обогатят и словарный запас ребенка, и расширят его кругозор.

   Попробуйте также отгадывать загадки для детей на досуге. Немного
   переключите фокус внимания и взгляните на привычные объекты по-новому!

   Берёза^[2] (лат. Bétula) — род листопадных деревьев и кустарников
   семейства Берёзовые (Betulaceae). Берёза широко распространена в Северном
   полушарии; на территории России принадлежит к числу наиболее
   распространённых древесных пород. Общее число видов — около ста^[3] или
   немного больше^[4]. Многие виды берёзы — широко распространённые и
   важнейшие лесообразующие породы, в значительной мере определяющие облик и
   видовой состав лиственных и хвойно-лиственных (смешанных) лесов в
   умеренной и холодной части Евразии и Северной Америки.

   Многие части берёзы используются в хозяйстве: древесина, кора, берёста
   (поверхностный слой коры), берёзовый сок. Почки и листья применяют в
   медицине: настои из почек и листьев — как мочегонное, бактерицидное,
   ранозаживляющее и жаропонижающее средство, а масляную вытяжку из берёзовых
   почек — как дерматологическое средство. Некоторые виды используют для
   создания полезащитных полос, а также в декоративном садоводстве.

   Берёза занимает важное место в культуре славян, скандинавов,
   финно-угорских и других народов.

Название

   Латинское родовое название было заимствовано из галльского языка^[5].

   Русское слово «берёза» происходит от праслав. *berza (отсюда и белор.
   бяро́за, укр. бере́за, болг. бре́за, сербохорв. бре̏за, словен. brė́za,
   чеш. bříza, польск. brzoza, в.-луж. brěza, н.-луж. brjaza^[6]),
   восходящего к пра-и.е. *b^herĝos (ср. лит. beržas, латыш. bērzs, осет.
   bærž, др.-инд. bhurjah, др.-англ. beorc, англ. birch, нем. Birke,
   нидерл. berk, норв. bjørk, швед. björk), от корня *b^herĝ- «светиться,
   белеть».

   Слово «берёза» родственно словам «берест» (лат. Ulmus),
   «берёста»^[источник не указан 549 дней].

Ботаническое описание

   Основной источник: ^[7]
   [IMG]Берёза вишнёвая
   Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги Köhler’s Medizinal-Pflanzen, 1887

   Большинство видов берёз — деревья высотой до 30 и даже 45 м, с обхватом
   ствола до 120—150 см, некоторые виды — кустарники от крупных до мелких,
   вплоть до стелющихся, едва приподнимающихся над землёй. Все представители
   рода — однодомные раздельнополые ветроопыляемые (анемофильные)
   растения^[8].

   Корневая система берёз мощная, в зависимости от вида и условий
   произрастания либо поверхностная, либо, что чаще, уходит косо вглубь.
   Стержневой корень проростка отмирает очень быстро, зато боковые корни
   развиваются мощно и богаты тонкими мочковидными корешками. Берёза растёт
   медленно только в первые годы. Потом, наоборот, начинает расти быстро, и
   это обеспечивает ей победу над конкурирующей травянистой
   растительностью^[источник не указан 549 дней]. Кора у большей части берёз
   белая, желтоватая, розоватая или красновато-бурая, у некоторых видов
   серая, коричневая или даже чёрная. Полости клеток пробковой ткани на
   стволах заполнены белым смолистым веществом — бетулином, который придаёт
   коре белую окраску^[9]. Внешняя часть — берёста — обычно легко
   отслаивается лентами. У старых деревьев нижняя часть ствола нередко
   покрывается тёмной коркой с глубокими трещинами.

   Листья берёзы очерёдные, цельные, по краю зубчатые, яйцевидно-ромбические
   или треугольно-яйцевидные, моносимметричные, с широким клиновидным
   основанием или почти усечённые, гладкие, до 7 см длиной и 4 см шириной,
   перед опаданием желтеют. Молодые листья клейкие. Жилкование листовой
   пластинки совершенное перисто-нервное (перисто-краебежное): боковые жилки
   оканчиваются в зубцах^[8].

   Почки попеременные, сидячие, покрытые спирально расположенными, часто
   клейкими чешуйками; боковые почки немного отстоящие.

   Мужские цветки в сложных соцветиях — серёжковидных тирсах — появляются ещё
   летом на вершинах удлинённых побегов, обычно по 2—3; сначала они стоячие и
   зелёного цвета, затем постепенно буреют. Их длина 2—4 см. Мужские серёжки
   состоят из многочисленных сросшихся с центральным цветочным стержнем
   щитовидных стебельчатых покровных чешуек, расширенных к вершине,
   снабжённых снизу двумя меньшими чешуйками и содержащих с внутренней
   стороны три цветка. Каждый цветок покрыт также чешуевидным околоцветником,
   в котором помещаются органы оплодотворения — тычинки. Снаружи вся серёжка
   покрыта непроницаемым для влаги смолистым веществом. В таком виде серёжки
   зимуют. Весной, в марте — мае (в зависимости от климата) стержень мужской
   серёжки удлиняется, вследствие чего окружающие цветок чешуйки
   раскрываются, и между ними становятся заметными жёлтые тычинки, обильно
   выделяющие цветочную пыльцу. В это время серёжки, стоявшие раньше прямо,
   сначала наклоняются, а затем и вовсе повисают. Женские серёжки вырастают
   на вершинах укороченных побегов (брахибластов), развивающихся из боковых
   почек прошлогодних побегов, и поэтому сидят всегда на боку ветки.
   Одновременно с зацветанием мужских серёжек распускаются листовые почки и
   женские серёжки. Во время цветения они всегда короче и у́же мужских,
   которые после опыления сразу же опадают. Прицветные (плодовые) чешуйки
   женских серёжек глубоко трёхлопастные; боковые лопасти обычно короче
   средней. Женские цветки (то есть одна лишь завязь) сидят по три под каждой
   прицветной чешуйкой; в каждой завязи по две висячих семяпочки, из которых
   по опылении одна засыхает, а вторая разрастается, занимая всю полость
   завязи. Женская оплодотворённая серёжка в это время удлиняется, нередко у
   неё вырастает ножка, а самая она утолщается вследствие увеличения объёма
   чешуек, превращаясь постепенно в овальную или продолговато-цилиндрическую
   «шишку». После созревания плодов, которое происходит довольно скоро — в
   зависимости от климата, в июле — сентябре — плодовая серёжка (шишка)
   осыпается и от неё остаётся лишь стержень. Формула цветка: [IMG] \ast
   P_{2}\;A_{2}\;G_{0} и [IMG] \ast P_{0}\;A_{0}\;G_{{(\underline 2)}}^[10].

   Плод — сплюснутый чечевицеобразный орешек, несущий на вершине два засохших
   столбика и окружённый более или менее широким тонкокожим перепончатым
   крылышком. Плоды сидят по три в пазухах трёхлопастных плодовых
   (прицветных) чешуек. Семена очень лёгкие — в одном грамме насчитывается
   5000 семян. Легко разносятся ветром (на расстояние до 100 м от
   материнского растения^[8]), плоды не вскрываются.

Распространение и экологическое состояние

   [IMG]Берёза карликовая на переднем плане. На заднем плане Берёза
   европейская белая

   Многие виды берёзы — широко распространённые и важнейшие лесообразующие
   породы, в значительной мере определяющие облик и видовой состав лиственных
   и хвойно-лиственных (смешанных) лесов в умеренной и холодной части Евразии
   и Северной Америки. Есть среди берёз и кустарники, самая известная из них
   Берёза карликовая (Betula nana) обычна в тундрах Европы и Северной
   Америки^[11] и горных тундрах Сибири. Она не достигает и 1 м в высоту. В
   ледниковый и послеледниковый периоды эта берёза была распространена
   гораздо дальше на юг, сейчас она встречается там лишь на болотах как
   реликт^[источник не указан 549 дней].

   Большинство берёз очень морозостойки, не страдают от весенних заморозков,
   переносят вечную мерзлоту, проникают далеко за Полярный круг или образуют
   верхнюю границу леса в горах (например, берёзовое криволесье на Кавказе).
   Более требовательны к теплу берёзы субтропических районов
   (гималайско-китайские, некоторые японские и американская Берёза речная
   (Betula nigra))^[12]. Самый южный и теплолюбивый вид берёзы на нашей
   планете — Берёза ольховидная (Betula alnoides), заходящая в горные районы
   муссонных тропиков Юго-Восточной Азии^[13]^[14].

   [IMG]Берёза карликовая, стелющаяся по камням. Гренландия

   К богатству почвы берёза не требовательна. Виды берёзы растут на песчаных
   и суглинистых, богатых и бедных, влажных и сухих почвах. Она встречается
   на сырых берегах рек и морей, на болотах, в болотистых тундрах, на сухих
   каменистых склонах, в знойных сухих степях. Так, например, Берёза Радде
   (Betula raddeana) образует леса, покрывающие ущелья в горно-лесном поясе в
   горах Дагестана^[12].

   Большинство берёз светолюбивы, хотя есть и довольно теневыносливые (Берёза
   ребристая (Betula costata), Берёза шерстистая (Betula lanata) и Берёза
   аллеганская (Betula alleghaniensis))^[12].

   Многие виды берёзы — пионеры заселения вырубок, гарей, пустошей и
   обнажений (такова Берёза повислая (Betula pendula)): в этих местах нередко
   наблюдаются чистые берёзовые насаждения (вторичные леса) в основном
   травяного типа, поэтому нередко берёзу относят к почвоулучшающим
   породам^[8]. В дальнейшем состав древостоя меняется: берёза вытесняется
   елью, так как еловая поросль может существовать под относительно светлым
   берёзовым пологом, а молодые берёзы затеняются елями и гибнут (см.
   Сукцессия)^[12].

   В лесостепи на увлажнённых местах в блюдцеобразных понижениях берёза
   (зачастую вместе с осиной и изредка с ивой) образует небольшие леса,
   называемые колка́ми. Колки́ характерны для лесостепи Западной Сибири,
   встречаются на Окско-Донской равнине^[15]. В то же время в Фенноскандии и
   на Русском Севере березняки являются монопородными, без малейшей примеси
   деревьев других пород; в отличие от смешанных лесов более южных
   широт^[16].

   [IMG]Берёзовый лес в районе Инари (финская заполярная Лапландия)

   Род Берёза в коллекциях ботанических садов России в целом представлен 92
   таксонами, исключительно в коллекциях открытого грунта. Крупнейшая
   коллекция рода находится в Главном ботаническом саду Российской Академии
   наук^[17].

   Продолжительность жизни берёзы, по разным данным, — 100—120 лет^[18], 150
   (300) лет^[19], 100—150 лет, отдельные деревья доживают до 400 лет и
   более^[12].

   На берёзе живут, помимо прочих, гусеница бражника липового, пяденица
   берёзовая, малинница обыкновенная^[источник не указан 549 дней].
   Жук-олень — самый крупный жук Европы^[источник не указан 549 дней] —
   обитает в древесине берёзы и других лиственных деревьев. Листьями берёзы
   питаются майские жуки, и в отдельные годы, когда их численность особенно
   высока, они способны причинить серьёзный вред деревьям^[12].

   Для берёзовых рощ и смешанных с берёзой лесов характерны
   микоризообразующие виды грибов, многие из которых живут в сообществе
   исключительно или преимущественно с берёзой. Наиболее обычны и известны из
   них^[20]:

   [IMG]Волнушка розовая среди сухих берёзовых листьев. Литва
     * подберёзовик обыкновенный и некоторые другие виды рода Обабок —
       подберёзовик болотный, подберёзовик розовеющий;
     * белый гриб берёзовый — относится к наиболее ценным съедобным грибам;
     * некоторые млечники (груздь чёрный, волнушка розовая), определённые
       виды сыроежек — сыроежка зелёная, сыроежка жёлтая, сыроежка пищевая.

   Повреждённые деревья могут поражаться паразитическими грибами — например,
   трутовиком скошенным (Inonotus obliquus), редко встречающимся на других
   деревьях. Препараты, получаемые из чаги — бесплодной формы трутовика
   скошенного, — применяются в народной и официальной медицине в качестве
   адаптогенов^[источник не указан 549 дней].

   Для берёзы характерны и специфические виды грибов — разрушителей отмершей
   древесины (сапротрофных), которые играют важнейшую роль в процессе
   самоочистки лесов от сухостоя, буреломов и т. п.^[21] Из них в берёзовых
   рощах обычны трутовик берёзовый (Piptoporus betulinus) и лензитес
   берёзовый (Lenzites betulina), первый из которых не встречается на
   древесине других пород, а второй обычно предпочитает берёзу^[22].

Химический состав

   В коре большинства видов содержится тритерпеноид бетулин, один из немногих
   белых органических пигментов. В коре берёзы ребристой (Betula costata) его
   содержание превышает 5 %, у берёзы повислой (Betula pendula) содержание
   бетулина доходит до 14 %, а в коре берёзы маньчжурской (Betula
   mandshurica) — до 27 %. Из видов, растущих в России, максимальное
   содержание бетулина наблюдается в коре берёзы пушистой (Betula
   pubescens) — до 44 %^[23].

   В почках берёзы повислой (равно как и пушистой) содержится примерно 3—5 %
   эфирного масла, основными компонентами которого являются бициклические
   сесквитерпеноиды. Почки содержат также смолистые вещества, алкалоиды,
   аскорбиновую кислоту, флавоноиды и высшие жирные кислоты^[24].

   В листьях содержатся эфирное масло, производные даммарана, кумарины,
   дубильные вещества и флавоноиды^[24].

     * В пчеловодстве берёза важна как пыльценос^[26].
     * Берёзовая лучина применялась в старину для освещения крестьянских
       изб — она горит ярко и почти без копоти.
     * Берёзовые веники заготавливаются как корм для домашнего скота на
       зимний период, также они используются в качестве банных.

  Древесина

   [IMG]
   Берёзовый шпон

   Берёзу рубят в возрасте спелости древесины, — от 40—50 лет. Раньше для
   получения крупного хорошего поделочного материала берёза срубалась в 60—80
   и даже иногда в 100-летнем возрасте^[12]; на дрова она пригодна в 40—60
   лет. На постройки берёза мало годится, так как скоро загнивает из-за
   развития грибка^[25].

   Тяжёлая плотная берёзовая древесина довольно прочная, хорошо
   сопротивляется раскалыванию. Цвет — белый, с более жёлтым ядром.
   Используется для изготовления высококачественной фанеры, лыж, мелких
   резных игрушек, прикладов огнестрельного оружия. Особенно ценится
   карельская берёза, которая отличается очень сложной фактурой
   древесины^[12].

   Наросты, изредка образующиеся на корнях, крупных сучьях или стволах
   берёз, — кап — на разрезе имеют своеобразный сложный и красивый рисунок.
   Обработанный кап издавна использовали для изготовления изящных поделок:
   шкатулок, табакерок, портсигаров, декоративных деталей мебели^[27].

  Дёготь

   Основная статья: Дёготь

   При сухой перегонке берёсты образуется берёзовый, или берёстовый,
   дёготь^[28].

   Берёзовый дёготь применяется в медицине и ветеринарии, преимущественно как
   противовоспалительное и антисептическое средство, входит в состав
   дегтярного мыла и разнообразных мазей и кремов, применяемых для лечения
   кожных заболеваний. В кожевенном производстве применяется при выделки
   юфти^[28].

   В старину им смазывали ступицы тележных колёс для уменьшения
   трения^[источник не указан 549 дней].

  Береста

   Основная статья: Берёста
   [IMG]Две стороны куска берёсты

   Верхний слой коры берёзы имеет собственное название — берёста, или
   береста́ (допустимы оба варианта написания и произношения^[29]). Благодаря
   присутствию смолистых веществ берёста отличается чрезвычайной прочностью и
   долговечностью^[30]. Берёста издавна применялась в промыслах народов
   Северной и Восточной Европы для изготовления таких предметов быта, как
   туесков, корзин, коробок, ковшей, лукошек и другой кухонной утвари, а
   также простейшей обуви (лапти)^[источник не указан 549 дней]. Народы
   Крайнего Севера и Дальнего Востока, а также многие североамериканские
   индейцы использовали берёсту для изготовления лодок и сооружения жилищ —
   чумов, вигвамов и т.д.

   Береста использовалась и в качестве материала для письма. Берёста
   прекрасно сохраняется в речных наносах, торфяниках, благодаря чему в
   1951 году экспедицией А. В. Арциховского были обнаружены первые берестяные
   грамоты — в Новгороде, где ко второму кварталу 2016 года их раскопали
   1079. Кроме того, они были найдены во многих других российских городах, в
   том числе на территории Москвы^[31], а также на Украине и в Беларуси.
   Помимо текстов на древнерусском языке, среди обнаруженных грамот есть и
   пять на неславянских языках (например, грамота № 292, содержащая
   карелоязычный заговор против молнии). Известно также множество древних
   китайских и санскритских текстов на берёсте^[12].

   В прежние времена берёсту употребляли в качестве средства от малярии^[32].

  Берёзовый сок

   [IMG]Заготовка берёзового сока, ГДР, апрель 1985 г.
   Основная статья: Берёзовый сок

   Берёзы к концу вегетативного периода накапливают питательные вещества, в
   том числе сахара́. Весной, с началом сокодвижения (до распускания
   листьев), эти вещества начинают подниматься к листьям^[источник не указан
   549 дней].

   Если на стволе сделать в это время надрезы, из них будет вытекать
   значительное количество сока (пасоки — жидкости, выделяющейся из
   перерезанных сосудов древесины стеблей или корней живых растений под
   влиянием корневого давления), содержащего от 0,43 до 1,13 % сахара^[26].
   Явление вытекания наблюдается вслед за первыми оттепелями; в первые дни
   вытекание незначительно, но затем постепенно возрастает и, достигнув через
   некоторое время максимума, начинает постепенно убывать, а ко времени
   распускания почек совершенно прекращается. Длительность вытекания сока —
   несколько недель^[33].

   Сбор берёзового сока истощает дерево, к тому же через раны на коре в живые
   ткани могут проникнуть болезнетворные микроорганизмы, дерево может
   заболеть и в конце концов погибнуть. В связи с этим после сбора сока
   рекомендуется повреждения на коре замазывать варом или глиной^[34].

   Берёзовый сок идёт на приготовление разных напитков. Крупная берёза может
   дать в сутки больше одного ведра сока. Сок иногда консервируют, подкисляя
   фосфорной кислотой. Упаренный берёзовый сок применяют для весенней
   подкормки пчёл^[26].

  Медицинское применение

   Берёзу традиционно использовали в лечебных целях: настои из берёзовых
   почек и листьев — как мочегонное, бактерицидное, ранозаживляющее и
   жаропонижающее средство^[30], а масляную вытяжку из берёзовых почек — как
   дерматологическое средство.

   Из эфирного масла берёзы вишнёвой (Betula lenta) (путём перегонки коры и
   побегов с водяным паром) получают метилсалицилат^[24].

   Берёзовый дёготь — традиционное консервирующее и дезинфицирующее
   средство^[30].

   Берёзовые веники в России традиционно использовали в лечебных и
   профилактических целях в русской бане^[30].

   Считалось, что запах берёзы будто бы излечивает от меланхолии и помогает
   от сглаза, а берёзовый сок, собранный в особые дни марта и апреля, очищает
   кровь^[35].

   В северных широтах берёзовая пыльца иногда является аллергеном,
   ответственным за проявление сезонной сенной лихорадки у людей с повышенной
   чувствительностью^[36].

  Кормовое значение

   Берёза карликовая (Betula nana L.), берёза пушистая (Betula pubescens
   Ehrh.), берёза повислая (Betula pendula Roth) играют важную роль в питании
   европейского лося (Alces alces). Наиболее охотно поедается молодая листва
   ранней весной. В Ленинградской области в мае порода составляет 31,4 % всех
   поедей, а в течение лета 15,3—19,8 %. Питательность зимних побегов
   чрезвычайно низка и сравнительно с другими породами резко падает по мере
   увеличения их диаметра. В первой половине зимы лоси почти не поедают
   берёзу, а систематически едят только при недостатке других более ценных
   кормов, обычно в феврале — апреле^[37].

  Виды рода Берёза

   Основная статья: Виды рода Берёза

   Представители рода отличаются высоким полиморфизмом, по современной
   классификации выделяется 89 подтвержденных видов, наиболее известные из
   них:

     * Берёза вишнёвая (Betula lenta). Вид из Северной Америки с блестящей
       красновато-коричневой или почти чёрной корой.
     * Берёза карликовая (Betula nana). Кустарник высотой обычно не более 1 м
       с мелкими округлыми листьями; растёт в Европе на болотах, в
       заболоченных сосняках.
     * Берёза низкая, или Берёза приземистая (Betula humilis). Кустарник
       высотой до 2 м с эллиптическими листьями; растёт в Европе по берегам
       водоёмов, на болотах.
     * Берёза повислая, или Берёза бородавчатая, или Берёза повисшая, или
       Берёза поникающая (Betula pendula). Вид, широко распространённый в
       Европе и Сибири; встречается также в северной Африке. Кора от
       снежно-белой до серовато-белой. Высота обычно 10—15 м, иногда до 30 м.
       Молодые побеги голые, бородавчатые (в отличие от берёзы опушённой, у
       которой молодые побеги опушённые и без бородавок).
     * Берёза полезная (Betula utilis). Вид из Гималаев высотой до 18 м со
       светлой гладкой корой.
     * Берёза пушистая, или Берёза опушённая (Betula pubescens). В
       Европейской части России нередко растёт рядом с берёзой бородавчатой.
       О том, как отличить эти виды, см. выше. Является номенклатурным типом.
     * Берёза чёрная (Betula nigra). Вид из восточной части Северной Америки.
       У молодых деревьев кора белая и гладкая, у более старых — тёмная,
       морщинистая. Предположительно, предковый вид^[40]
     * Берёза Эрмана, или Берёза каменная (Betula ermanii). Встречается на
       Камчатке, Сахалине, по берегам Охотского моря. Названа каменной за на
       редкость твёрдую, плотную и тяжёлую древесину, которая тонет в воде.

Культивирование

  Агротехника

   В России лучший рост берёзовых насаждений замечается в северных и средних
   областях, на умеренно влажных, не слишком плотных почвах, не бедных
   содержанием перегноя. Различие в минеральном составе почв не обнаруживает
   особенно заметного влияния на рост берёзы, и только на известковых почвах
   она растёт весьма редко. Нуждаясь, как светолюбивая древесная порода, в
   достаточном солнечном освещении, она рано изреживается в чистых
   насаждениях, что влияет неблагоприятным образом на плодородие почвы.
   Произрастая же в смеси с хвойными породами и отличаясь быстрым ростом,
   берёза скоро обгоняет их в высоту и обнаруживает вредное влияние на их
   дальнейшее произрастание: её длинные и тонкие ветви, приводимые в движение
   ветром, сбивают, «охлёстывают» почки у хвойных, вследствие чего деревья
   этих пород становятся уродливыми. После срубки берёза успешно
   возобновляется как семенами, ежегодно производимыми в изобилии, так и
   порослью от пня, появляющейся возле шейки корня даже у старых 60—70-летних
   деревьев^[41].

   При выращивании берёз в декоративных целях следует учесть, что соседство с
   ними действует на многие растения угнетающе. Происходит это по следующим
   причинам:

     * берёзы обычно отличаются более быстрым ростом по сравнению с другими
       деревьями;
     * берёзы иссушают почву;
     * при разложении опавшей берёзовой листвы выделяются вещества, которые
       являются для некоторых растений ингибиторами роста.

   С берёзами в культуре хорошо уживаются молодые ели, а также многие виды
   шиповника^[42].

  Сорта

   Известно довольно большое число декоративных форм различных видов этого
   рода. Некоторые из них^[43]:

     * Betula nigra 'Heritage' — сорт отличается розоватой корой, которая,
       отслаиваясь, закручивается;
     * Betula pendula 'Purpurea' — отличается пурпурными листьями;
     * Betula pendula 'Laciniata' (другое название —  'Dalecarlica') —
       отличается поникающими ветвями и глубоко рассечёнными листьями;
     * Betula pendula 'Tristis' — дерево с плакучей кроной;
     * Betula pendula 'Yongii' — дерево с плакучей кроной;
     * Betula platyphylla 'Whitespire' — высокое стройное дерево с
       белоснежной корой;
     * Betula utilis 'Jermyns' — высокое дерево с белоснежной корой.

Проблема массового засыхания берёз

   [IMG]Берёзовый лес, поражённый болезнью, Липецкая область

   Средняя продолжительность жизни берёз составляет около 100—200 лет, однако
   этот возраст считается предельным. На практике возраст деревьев колеблется
   от 60 до 100. После 60 лет зачастую наблюдается высокая болезненность
   деревьев, при которой берёзовые рощи массово засыхают начиная с верхушек и
   затем полностью. В период сильных ветров деревья ломаются и образуют
   завалы. Причиной в том числе служит бактериальная водянка, болезнь
   вызываемая бактерией Erwinia multivora^[44] Больше всего уязвимы деревья
   старше 40 лет. Часто проблема встречается в Европейской части России и в
   Сибири. О неожиданном и резком усыхании целых лесов сообщают в разных
   регионах в том числе местные новости, лесничества при этом стараются
   начать санитарные рубки больных деревьев.^[45].

  Берёза в мифологии

   Дохристианская символика, связанная с берёзой, известна у многих народов,
   проживавших в регионах распространения этого растения; это относится и к
   кельтам, и к древним скандинавам, и к славянам. Для всех этих народов
   берёза являлась в первую очередь символом перехода от весны к лету и, в
   более широком смысле, символом смерти и воскрешения^[35].

    Финно-угры, германцы

   [IMG]Берёза — кереметь (объект поклонения) в чувашской деревне

   Начиная со времён родового строя берёза — культовое дерево и национальный
   символ у большинства финно-угров — карел, вепсов, манси, хантов, пермяков,
   коми-зырян и финнов (сумь, емь), а также весьма почитаемое национальное
   дерево у скандинавов — шведов и норвежцев^[46]. Не последнюю очередь в
   культовом статусе данного дерева играет и его распространение в
   Фенноскандии: берёза является самым северным деревом региона, и её ареал
   простирается даже таёжных лесов, доходя за 71° с. ш. Также на почитание
   берёзы могли повлиять её броский внешний вид и устойчивость к сильным
   нагрузкам, вроде нагрянувшей бури. Не исключено, что берёза могла быть
   почитаемым деревом у жителей этого региона ещё в каменном веке, поскольку
   берёза стала первой породой деревьев, проникшей на Север после окончания
   оледенения (лишь после неё, да и то, значительно позднее, там появилась
   сосна)^[47] По-видимому, почитание берёзы скандинавскими германцами было
   позаимствовано у финно-угорских народов^[48]. У скандинавов берёза была
   символом богини Нерты, которая считалась великой Матерью-Землёй.^[источник

   У германских народов из берёзы изготовляется так называемый «майский шест»
   (англ. maypole, нем. Maibaum), обильно украшаемый на майские праздники
   (Троицу, первомай) и являющийся одним из их главных компонентов^[49] — он
   является центром сбора молодёжи и различных увеселений под открытым небом.
   Майский шест обладает перекладиной наверху, обильно украшаемой, в
   частности, обвиваемой молодыми берёзовыми ветвями и первыми полевыми
   цветами^[48]. Также в качестве майского дерева может выступать живая
   берёзка. В северной и средней Швеции праздники в промежутке 22 апреля-1
   мая называются «днями берёзы», поэтому не исключено, что данный обычай
   является пережитком древних праздников, устраивавшихся у берёзы, как
   священного дерева^[48].

   В представлениях многих финно-угорских народов (в частности, у мордвы)
   берёза ассоциировалась с Мировым древом^[50].

   По карело-финским представлениям, берёза являлась одним из культовых
   деревьев хийси — лесных духов (наряду с сосной и т.д.)^[51]. Среди карел
   Финляндии на Юханнус было принято ставить во дворе или заносить в избу
   либо берёзовую ветвь, либо небольшую берёзку^[52]. Время от Юханнуса до
   Петрова дня среди финнов и карел считалось наиболее благоприятным от
   избавления от насекомых. Так, по поверью, записанному в посёлке Войница
   Калевальского района Карелии, разбросанные по избе в Иванов день берёзовые
   листья избавляют от кровососущих^[53]. В селе Пертозеро Ругозерской
   волости было известно следующее гадание: вечером Петрова дня девушки с
   приговором собирали мелкие берёзовые и осиновые листья, после чего
   заворачивали их в платок, которым вытирали пот с лица и клали его под
   подушку, после чего девушке приснится её суженый. Также платок с листьями
   можно было незаметно подсунуть в карман того, кого любила девушка^[54].
   При посещении кладбищ могилы «опахивали», то есть, подметали, берёзовыми
   вениками^[55]. Также карелы верили, что парка девушек в сауне берёзовыми
   вениками повышает их т.н. лемпи/лемби — сексуальную энергию и
   привлекательность^[56].

   По представлениям нижегородских марийцев, как сообщает исследователь их
   культуры и мифологии, Николай Морохин, берёза является «женской» породой
   дерева (наряду с липой), в то время как мужской был дуб. Во многих местах
   у домов стояли почитаемые берёзы^[57].

   [IMG]Стефан Пермский срубает прокудливую берёзу

   «Житие Стефана Пермского» сообщает, что близ села Усть-Вымь находилась
   т.н. «прокудливая (т.е. проклятая) берёза», которой поклонялись местные
   жители — зыряне и пермяки. Святитель Стефан Пермский в ходе своей
   просветительской и проповеднической миссии среди язычников в 1379 году
   срубил и сжёг эту берёзу, при этом когда Стефан рубил её, она будто бы
   издавала стоны, а ствол истекал кровью. Впоследствии, как сообщает
   предание, на этом месте была построена первая в крае церковь, а её престол
   расположился непосредственно на пне срубленной берёзы^[58]^[59].

   У удмуртов среди священных предметов каждого рода, хранившихся в
   специальном культовом коробе воршуда (покровителя рода), была и берёзовая
   ветвь^[60]. Это отражение бытовавшего у них мифа о боге Кылдысине, некогда
   жившем среди людей, но потом улетевшем на небо. После того, как люди стали
   отчаянно просить Кылдысина вернуться в каком угодно обличье, тот появился
   на вершине берёзы в облике белки^[61]. Таким образом, берёза считалась
   священным деревом этого бога, под которым ему возносились мольбы^[62]. На
   берёзе также, по представлениям удмуртов, обитали души новорождённых
   (покровительницей которых была богиня земли Калтащ-эква)^[60].

   У поволжских финно-угров существовало такое понятие, как «керемет(ь)»,
   обозначавшее священную рощу, состоявшую из сакральных деревьев, в число
   которых входила и берёза^[63].

   По представлениям мордовских народов, под Мировым древом (которым могла
   быть и берёза), верховный бог Нишке собирает целый пантеон богов, иногда
   насчитывающий семь^[64]. Там же гигантская птица высадила три яйца, из
   которых вылупились три «авы», духи-матери: Норов-ава, мать полей;
   Вирь-ава, мать леса; и Варма-ава, мать ветра^[65]. У эрзян дереву посвящён
   обрядовый праздник «Тудоннь ильтямонь чи» (с эрз. — «Праздник
   берёзы»)^[источник не указан 549 дней].

   Отличительной чертой погребального ритуала финно-пермян, согласно
   археологическим данным, является обёртывание умершего в берёсту. Северные
   русские и старообрядцы укладывают покойника в гроб (домовину) на берёзовые
   веники без комля^[источник не указан 549 дней].

   Согласно древним представлениям манси и хантов^[источник не указан 549
   дней], Священная берёза-праматерь, принадлежавшая Калтащ-экве, богине
   земли, была златолистой и росла семью серебряными стволами из одного
   основания^[48]. Сама Калтащ-эква, согласно мифам и песням, обитала в
   подножии семи берёз, Мирового древа^[66]. Фетишем Нуми-Торума, небесного
   бога, служила берёза^[67], позади его жилища росла берёза с золотыми
   ветвями, на которых сидело семь кукушек — олицетворений человеческих душ.
   Также берёза была священным деревом Калтащ-эквы и Мось — прародительницы
   одноимённой фратрии^[68].

   В фольклоре балтийских и германских народов сохранились устойчивые
   употребления, при которых слово берёза выступает в значении чистоты,
   невинности^[69].

    Индоиранские народы

   У осетин берёза считалась одним из почитаемых деревьев. В нартском эпосе
   (известном у практически всех народов западного и центрального Кавказа,
   включая осетин) берёзы были в числе деревьев, откликнувшиеся на зов
   умирающего богатыря-нарта Сослана, за что он благословил берёзу и пожелал
   навеки быть лучшим из деревьев. Из берёзы, как чистого и почитаемого
   дерева, изготавливались вертелы, оглобли, ярма, деревянные детали мельницы
   и т.д. Осетины верили, что в хлеву, где находился волшебный берёзовый
   прутик, находившееся там стадо не уменьшалось, сколько бы его оттуда не
   убывало^[70].

    Кельты

   Кельты хоронили умерших в шапках из берёзовой коры^[35].

    Славяне

   [IMG]«Семик», лубок XIX в.

   В представлениях славян отношение к берёзе было двойственным: согласно
   одним традициям, дерево и изделия из него, в том числе из берёсты,
   считались оберегом от нечистой силы; в частности, берёзовые веники,
   использовавшиеся в бане, рассматривались и как инструменты ритуального
   очищения^[35]. С другой же стороны, берёза считалась нечистым деревом, в
   ветвях которого поселяются черти и русалки, и которое является воплощением
   душ умерших родственников; берёза также считалась деревом, из которого
   нечистая сила делает свои инструменты — к примеру, ведьмы, согласно
   поверьям, летают на берёзовых мётлах^[35].

   В представлениях русских берёза представало как дерево, приносящее добро и
   оберегающее от нечисти и болезней. Именно поэтому она издавна являлась
   почитаемым деревом. Кроме того, берёза символизировало женское начало, и
   покровительствовала девушкам и молодым женщинам. Также в русских поверьях
   присутствовала связь берёзы с душами предков^[71].

   В русской крестьянской поэзии очень распространён образ берёзы,
   ассоциируемый с образом выходящей замуж невесты (парным персонажем,
   женихом, является дуб). Как персонаж (порой антропоморфный), берёза
   фигурирует и в русских народных сказках. Так, в сказке «Дурак и берёза»
   главный герой пытается продать быка своих братьев берёзе (дураку кажется,
   что шелестящая листьями на ветру берёза будто бы разговаривает с ним), но,
   после безуспешного торга о цене, привязывает быка к ней и откладывает
   сделку на завтра. На следующий день, когда быка съели волки, дурак
   безуспешно пытается выбить долг у берёзы, и в конце концов, на третий день
   рубит её, находя в дупле котёл с золотом. Также берёза является одним из
   немаловажных персонажей в сказке «Берёза и три сокола».

   В украинском и чешском языках именем берёзы назван месяц март (укр.
   березень, чеш. březen). В Древней Руси названием «березозол» (др.-рус.
   брѣзозолъ, березозолъ) обозначался апрель. Названия марта и апреля,
   связанные с берёзой, указывают на время появления листвы на берёзе (от
   праслав. *berzozolъ, где элемент праслав. *-zolъ связан с понятием
   «зеленеть, зелёный»)^[72]^[73]^[74].

   См. также: Семик

   Берёза имеет ключевое значение в Семи́ке — восточнославянском празднике,
   отмечающимся в четверг на седьмой неделе после Пасхи и за три дня до
   Троицы (Троицына дня)^[75], а также существенную роль на сам Троицын
   день^[71]. Поскольку эти дни связаны с поминанием умерших, то и берёза,
   как растение, также связанное с предками, занимала отнюдь не последнее
   место^[76]. Так как, как уже было указано выше, берёза в представлениях
   русских является «женским» деревом, то и Семик считался сугубо женским
   праздником^[77]. Из справляемых во время Семика обрядов был и обряд
   завивания берёзы, найденные плакучие ветви берёзы заплетались в венки,
   косы, прикреплялись к земле и там закреплять колышками, связывались между
   собой ленточками, и так далее^[78]. Когда-то важность обряда была столь
   высока, что с участием/неучастием в нём связывалась жизнь или смерть
   матери^[79]. Другим из обрядов было т.н. «кумление», в ходе которого
   девушки устанавливали дружеские отношения на определённый срок. Кумились
   все присутствовавшие, что объединяло их в своего рода союз^[77]^[80].
   Одним из наиболее распространённых способов кумления был следующий: две
   девушки, близкие подруги подходили с двух сторон к завитому на берёзе
   венку, троекратно целовались, говорили «покумимся кума, покумимся, чтобы
   нам с тобой не браниться, вечно дружиться», после чего обменивались
   нательными крестиками и небольшими подарками^[80]. После этого вокруг
   берёзы начинали водить хоровод, после него устраивали пиршество с блюдами,
   чьими основными блюдами были яйца и яичница, лепёшки, пироги,
   пиво^[77]^[78]. В песнях, исполнявшихся во время праздника, берёза
   антропоморфизировалась, наделялась женскими чертами, она призывала
   девушек-участниц идти в поле и вить венки или же сама обещала загнуться и
   завиться в веночки^[81]. Во время празднования обеих праздников дома и
   храмы (как и изнутри, так и снаружи) украшались берёзовыми ветвями или
   срубленными берёзками. Данный обычай, проводимый на Троицу, имел (и до сих
   пор имеет) место как и православных славян, так и католиков^[30]^[71],
   также берёзовые веники подносили к культовым сооружениям и карелы^[82].
   Обряды, связанные с берёзами, заканчивались в Духов день, приходящийся на
   понедельник, следующий за Троицей^[80]. Впрочем, на территории
   современного Киришского района Ленобласти на Ивана Купалу засохшие к тому
   моменту троицкие берёзки собирали молодёжь и молодые семейные пары, вешали
   на специально выбранную ель и сжигали^[83].

    Тюркские народы

   Считается, что Умай (Умайя) — тюркская богиня, олицетворяющая земное
   естество — спустилась на землю с двумя берёзами^[35].

   У чувашей, тюркского народа, исторически проживающего по соседству с
   поволжскими финно-уграми, также существует понятие креметей, в число
   которых входит и берёза.

   По представлениям якутов, у каждого рода есть своё священное дерево, ал
   лук мас (якут. аал луук мас), в котором обитает дух-покровительница этого
   места. В числе тотемных деревьев могли быть и старые, могучие берёзы^[84].

  Русские пословицы, поговорки, загадки и шутки о берёзе

     * Стоит дерево, цветом зелено. В этом дереве — четыре угодья: первое —
       больным на здоровье, второе — людям колодец, третье — от зимы свет,
       четвёртое — дряхлым пеленанье.
     * Берёза не угроза: где стоит, там и шумит (Яросл. губ.)^[85].
     * Бела береста — да дёготь чёрен^[85].
     * Тонка берёза, да разуму учит^[85].

  Идиоматика

   Русское устойчивое выражение «дать/всыпать/задать берёзовой каши»
   («накормить/угостить берёзовой кашей», или просто «берёзовая каша»)
   означает «выпороть розгами». Схожие выражения с аналогичным смыслом
   встречаются и в других славянских языках (укр. дати/всипати березової
   каши, белор. даць/даваць бярозавай кашы, диал. чеш. dač březové
   kaše)^[86]. Аналогичное значение и у английского глагола «to birch;
   birching». Происхождение русской идиомы и английского слова (для которого
   это значение является основным) связано с тем, что часто розги изготовляли
   из берёзовых прутьев^[86].

  В геральдике

   Берёза в геральдике является естественной фигурой и распространённым
   геральдическим символом. Чаще всего берёза присутствует геральдике
   немецкоязычных стран и отчасти в чешской, реже — в российской. В
   германской геральдике берёза присутствует издревле — в гербах XII века
   берёза в основном изображалась в виде кустообразного дерево с золотой
   листвой и стволом либо серебряным, либо тоже золотым. В более поздних
   геральдических примерах (не только в немецкоязычных странах, но и Швеции)
   берёза имеет более достоверный вид — зеленое кустообразное дерево с белым
   (серебряным) стволом, независимо от цвета поля щита. На чешских гербах
   практически не встречается изображение целого берёзового дерева, как
   правило, изображается берёзовый лист треугольной формы и зелёного цвета,
   притом естественной формы, а не стилизованный^[48]. В российской
   геральдике у берёзы нет чёткого эмблематического вида, она изображается в
   виде дерева с кудреватой кроной зелёного цвета и с неясно очерченным
   чёрно-серым стволом^[87].

   Берёза из-за её особого места в русской традиционной культуре считается
   одним из символов России, поэтому во многих случаях её название
   использовалось для обозначения объектов, связанных с Россией (несмотря на
   то, что на сегодняшний день берёза так и не признана официальным
   национальным деревом России, равно как и любое другое дерево):

     * «Берёза» — одно из первых стихотворений Сергея Есенина (1913 г.,
       опубликовано в журнале «Мирок» в 1914 г.)^[88].
     * «Берёзка» — сеть валютных магазинов, существовавших в РСФСР с 1964 по
       1991 гг.
     * «Берёзка» — двухцветный камуфляж, практиковавшийся в СССР, а затем — в
       России^[89].
     * С берёзы начался Невский проспект в Санкт-Петербурге. На месте
       Адмиралтейского сада было посажено четыре ряда берёз, и это положило
       начало магистрали.
     * «Берёзка», государственный академический хореографический ансамбль,
       получивший название от первой постановки его основательницы и первой
       руководительницы, Надежды Надеждиной хоровода «Берёзка» (1948 г.),
       положенного на песню «Во поле берёзка стояла».
     * «Берёзовое» — одно из драгоценных пасхальных яиц Фаберже,
       изготовленное в 1917 году из карельской берёзы.
     * В императорской России было построено несколько «берёзовых домиков» —
       парковых павильонов, обитых снаружи берёзовыми жердями или тонкими
       брёвнами с неснятой корой: в Гатчине, в Кузьминках, в Петергофе.
       Такого рода павильоны-сюрпризы были типичны для российских парков
       второй половины XVIII века, за их намеренно скромным фасадом скрывался
       роскошный интерьер.

    В русской музыке

     * «Во поле берёза стояла» — русская народная хороводная песня, впервые
       опубликованная в 1790 г. в сборнике «Собрание народных русских песен с
       их голосами».
     * «Белая берёза» («Над тихоней речкой рос кудрявый клён…»; 1960 г.,) —
       песня Владимира Трепетцова. Звучала в некоторых фильмах, например, в
       «Москва слезам не верит» и «Афоня»)^[90].
     * «Берёзовый сок» — песня советской и белорусской фолк-рок-группы (ВИА)
       «Песняры»^[91].
     * «Русские берёзы» (слова Талгата Нигматулина, музыка Е. Ширяева) —
       песня, известная в исполнении Василия Зинкевича.
     * «Растёт в Волгограде берёзка» (музыка Григория Пономаренко, слова В.
       Агашина) — песня, известная в исполнении Людмилы Зыкиной.
     * «Берёзы» («Отчего так в России берёзы шумят…») — песня группы
       фолк-рок-группы Любэ, известная в исполнении Сергея Безрукова в
       телесериале «Участок» (2003 г.).

  В культуре других народов

     * Торама — деревянный духовой инструмент мордвы (эрзян и мокшан),
       изготавливаемый из ветви берёзы или клёна, которую продольно
       раскалывают пополам, сердцевину каждой половины выдалбливают, а затем
       половины обматывают берёстой. При обмотке берёстой одну сторону трубы
       делают шире, а другую у́же. Внутрь трубы вставляют язык из берёсты.
     * Цыгане оборачивали нательную рубашку вокруг берёзы и по первому звуку,
       услышанному после этого, предсказывали будущее^[35].
     * Берёза, в том числе карельская, чаще всего используется для
       изготовления рукояти традиционного скандинавского (в основном
       финского) ножа пуукко.
     * Алексей Ермолов в книге «Народная сельскохозяйственная мудрость в
       пословицах, поговорках и приметах» (издание 1905 года) приводит как
       интересное поверье у киргизов, а также у других азиатских народов,
       следующее выражение про берёзу: «Где меж елей вырастет берёза, туда
       непременно придут русские»^[85].
     * Берёза повислая — официальное дерево-национальный символ Финляндии,
       избранное на основе опросов, проведённых в 1988 году по инициативе
       Финской ассоциации по охране природы. В то же время у России до сих
       пор нет дерева с аналогичным статусом. Тем не менее, разновидность
       берёзы повислой, карельская, была официально объявлена официальным
       растением Республики Карелии по итогам конкурса «Аллея России»,
       прошедшего в 2014 году. Из претендентов на национальное карельское
       растение, помимо берёзы, были вереск обыкновенный, ель финская, сосна
       обыкновенная и страусник обыкновенный. За берёзу было отдано 65 %
       голосов от общего числа голосовавших^[92]. Символом Курганской области
       по итогам этого же конкурса, стала берёза Крылова, за которую было
       отдано 46 % голосов^[93]. Результаты голосования были объявлены на
       заседании оргкомитета конкурса, прошедшем в ноябре 2014 года в
       Минприроды России^[92].

  Топонимика

   От названия данного дерева образовано огромное количество топонимов в
   славяноязычных странах (включая Россию), а также в балтоязычных странах
   (например, от лит. beržas) и в Финляндии (от фин. koivu). В частности,
   довольно распространённым явлением является образование славянских
   гидронимов (прежде всего, названий рек) от названий деревьев, по
   подсчётам, на первом месте по частоте употребления в речных названиях
   находится берёза. Как правило, топоним (прежде всего ойконим) получал
   название из-за расположенного поблизости березняка^[94].

     * Название венгерского города Ньиредьхаза (венг. Nyíregyháza) образовано
       от области Ньиршег (венг. Nyírség), где он находится, и чьё название,
       в свою очередь, восходит к венг. nyir — берёза.
     * Название горного хребта Улан-Бургасы (Бурятия), означает «красный
       березняк».
     * Посёлок городского типа Берёзово (ХМАО) был основан на месте
       хантыйского поселения Хумгутваш/Халь-уш (соответственно с хант. и
       манс. берёзовый город)^[95]^[96].
     * Алтайское название села Удаловка (Республика Алтай) — алт. Ала-Кайыҥ,
       означает «разноцветная берёза»^[97].
     * От мордовского названия берёзы (эрз. и мокш. килей) происходит
       гидроним Келя (река, правый приток Пьяны) и ойконим Килелей (деревня
       Богородского района) в Нижегородской области^[94].
     * В честь дерева названо поселение Бёрчтаун в канадском графстве Шелберн
       (Новая Шотландия).

    Славянская топонимика

     * От названия деревья, в частности, образован гидроним Березина,
       название правого притока Днепра (Беларусь).
     * От названия деревья образованы следующие ойконимы:
          * В России — Берёза (микрорайон Самары), Березники (Пермский
            край)^[95], Белая Берёзка (Брянская область), Берёзов Майдан
            (Нижегородская область)^[94], Берёзовский, Березята
            (Нижегородская область, Марий Эл), Березополье (местность в
            Нижегородчине)^[94], Березник (Вологодская область, трудпосёлок
            для спецпереселенцев, раскулаченных крестьян, существовавший в
            1930-1947 гг.^[98]), Березовский^[98].
          * На Украине — Березнеговатое (укр. Березнегувате, Николаевская
            область), Березна (Черниговская область), Березанка,
            Березань^[95]^[99].
          * В Беларуси — Берёза (белор. Бяроза, Брестская
            область)^[95]^[100].
          * В восточнославянских странах в целом — Березовка (рус. , укр.
            Березівка, белор. Бярозаўка)^[94]^[98]^[99]^[100]^[101], Березино
            (рус. , укр. Березине, белор. Беразіно)^[94]^[99]^[100], Березно
            (рус. , укр. Березне), Березовец (рус. , укр.
            Березовець)^[94]^[99], Берёзки (рус. , укр. Березки, белор.
            Бярозкі)^[94], Берёзово (рус. , укр. Березово, белор.
            Бярозава)^[94]^[95]^[98], Берёзовый (рус. )^[94], Березовое (рус.
            )^[98].
          * В Чехии — Бржиза^[источник не указан 32 дня].

   Дуб (лат. Quércus) — род деревьев и кустарников семейства Буковые
   (Fagaceae).

   Род объединяет около 600 видов^[2]. Дуб хорошо узнаваем благодаря его
   плодам, желудям, являющимся, по сути, орехами.

Распространение[править | править код]

   Естественным ареалом дуба являются прежде всего регионы Северного
   полушария с умеренным, субтропическим и тропическим климатом. Южной
   границей распространения являются тропические высокогорья, по которым, в
   частности, несколько видов дуба пересекают экватор и незначительно заходят
   в Южное полушарие (Южная Америка и острова Индонезии).

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   [IMG]Дуб черешчатый. Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги О. В. Томе Flora
   von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, 1885

   Большинство дубов — крупные, плотные деревья. Многие виды этого рода
   принадлежат к числу так называемых вечнозелёных, то есть снабжены
   кожистыми листьями, остающимися на растении по нескольку лет. У других
   листья опадают ежегодно или, высыхая, остаются на дереве и разрушаются
   постепенно. Большинство вечнозеленых видов имеют цельные листья, другие —
   лопастные. Цветки однодомные: мужские и женские на одном и том же
   растении. Женские цветки образуют небольшие пучки или серёжки, мужские
   собраны висящими или стоячими, часто длинными серёжками. Цветочные покровы
   простые, слабо развитые, но при основании женских цветов образуется
   множество чешуевидных листочков, находящихся на кольчатом валике, который
   есть не что иное, как разросшееся цветоложе.
   Формула цветка: \ast P_{{(6-8)}}\;A_{{6-10}}\;G_{0} и \ast
   P_{{3+3}}\;A_{0}\;G_{{(\underline 3)}}^[3].

   При созревании плодов этот валик вместе со своими чешуями разрастается ещё
   больше и таким образом формируется характерное блюдце — плюска, которая
   облекает снизу дубовый плод, или жёлудь. У разных видов дуба величина
   желудей и форма чешуек крайне разнообразны: у одних чешуйки весьма малы, у
   других, как у дуба венгерского, длиной почти в сантиметр, отвёрнуты
   и т. д. Завязь цветков дуба почти всегда трёхгнёздая; но во время
   созревания плодов разрастается только одно гнездо и получается
   односемянный плод с крепким кожистым околоплодником, причисляемый к числу
   орехообразных плодов.

Наиболее известные виды[править | править код]

   См. также: Виды рода Дуб
   [IMG]Дуб каменный на равнине в Испании [IMG]Листья дуба болотного (Quercus
   palustris)

   Разные виды дуба распространены в умеренных и тёплых странах; в жарких
   странах — в горах. В Южной Америке, за исключением её северной
   оконечности, нет ни одного; нет их также в Австралии; в Африке только в
   странах при Средиземном море. В средней Европе их до 20 видов.

   В России значительно распространён только один вид — Дуб черешчатый
   (Quercus robur) с двумя разновидностями: различие между ними заключается в
   том, что одна цветёт в середине или в конце весны — это летний дуб, а
   другая — двумя или тремя неделями позже — это зимний дуб^[источник не
   указан 626 дней].

   Дуб доходит в северо-западной России до Финляндии, до 60° и даже 61°
   северной широты. В восточном направлении северный предел распространения
   дуба постепенно спускается к югу, и, подходя к Уральскому хребту,
   понижается до 57° и несколько южнее. Урал является восточной границей
   ареала дуба черешчатого.

   В западной России и на черноморском побережье Кавказа встречается весьма
   распространённый в остальной Европе вид — Дуб скальный (Quercus petraea).
   Оба эти дуба составляют главный состав русских дубовых лесов и рощ, число
   и обширность которых с каждым годом уменьшаются.

   В Приамурье и на Дальнем Востоке произрастает другой вид — Дуб монгольский
   (Quercus mongolica), реже там встречается Дуб зубчатый (Quercus dentata).
   Небольшая реликтовая роща дуба монгольского имеется в Забайкалье, недалеко
   от пограничной заставы Урюпино^[4].

   В 1950—1980-х годах предпринимались попытки акклиматизации дуба в
   Алтайском крае. Если посадки 1950-х годов проходили с переменным успехом,
   то насаждения 1980-х оказались успешными: дубы прижились и плодоносят,
   жёлуди разносятся птицами и бурундуками на значительные расстояния, где
   также приживаются^[5].

   [IMG]Поперечный спил ствола пробкового дуба Quercus suber.

   Древесина дуба отличается прочностью, крепостью, плотностью, твёрдостью и
   тяжестью.

   Свойства древесины зависят от условий произрастания дерева. Так
   различается:

     * дуб боровой, дубровный или каменный (Quercus ilex), выросший на сухих
       песчаных местах — в дубравах или борах; кора у него толстая, почти
       чёрная; древесина мелкослойная, соломенно-жёлтого цвета, отличается
       твёрдостью, но малоупруга;
     * дуб ольсовый, свинцовый, железный или водяной, произраставший по
       берегам текучих вод и на возвышенных местах, среди ольховых трясин
       (ольс); он с кожистой корой светлого синевато-серого цвета, покрытой
       беловатыми пятнами, и прямым стволом с густой, редко сухой, вершиной;
       древесина крупнослойная с бледно-розовым отливом и белой оболонью,
       очень тяжёлая, весьма упругая, но при высыхании сильно трескающаяся;
     * на местах средних между бором и ольсом вырастает дуб с древесиной
       переходных качеств — желтоватой, с белой оболонью, более упругой, чем
       дубровного дуба, но ниже ольсового, и по твёрдости уступающей обоим;
       кора на стволе толстая, мягкая, серо-бурая, покрытая в трещинах
       красноватым налётом, а с северной стороны зеленоватым мхом;
       суховершинность и дупловатость комлевой части ствола довольно часты.

   Дубовая древесина — превосходный строительный и поделочный материал: она
   идёт на подводные и сухопутные постройки, устройство подводных и основных
   частей деревянных судов (преимущественно летнего дуба) и как бочарный,
   экипажный, машинный, мебельный, паркетный и столярный лес (предпочитается
   зимний дуб); особенно ценится для последних морёный дуб, долго пролежавший
   в воде (до сотни лет) и имеющий тёмную, почти чёрную древесину. Хорошо
   поддаётся искусственному старению (браширование).

   От бортов корабля USS Constitution, сделанных из виргинского дуба^[en],
   могли отскакивать даже выпущенные из пушек ядра^[6].

   Хотя теплота сгорания древесины дуба выше, чем у других древесных пород
   средней полосы России, но для полного сгорания дубовых дров требуется
   большая тяга воздуха, дубовый уголь плохо держит жар.

  Дубовая кора[править | править код]

   Дубовая кора содержит много дубильной кислоты, а потому идёт на дубление
   кож. Дубовые галлы, или чернильные орешки, то есть патологические
   образования на листьях (вызванные насекомыми из рода Cynips^[en], которые
   откладывают яйца в тело листа), также содержат дубильную кислоту и
   краситель, служащие для дубления, приготовления красок и чернил для
   письма. Такие орешки образуются и на дубе, произрастающем в средней полосе
   России, и на малоазиатском и греческом дубе — Quercus infectoria^[en] и
   пр. В тех же странах растёт Дуб австрийский (Quercus cerris), плодовые
   блюдца которого идут также на дубление и составляют предмет значительной
   торговли. У дуба пушистого (Quercus pubescens) из Восточного
   Средиземноморья и соседних областей Азии они служат для дубления кож,
   крашения тканей и производства чернил.

   Отвар дубовой коры мастера древесной пластики используют для получения
   эффекта чёрного дерева^[7]^:89.

   Кора дуба используется в качестве лекарственного средства ^[привести
   цитату? 1950 дней]. Дубильные вещества оказывают вяжущее и
   противовоспалительное действие, при диарее «закрепляя» кишечник. Настой,
   или отвар хорош в качестве полоскания при инфекциях полости рта и горла, а
   также при воспалении дёсен. Он «дубит» слизистую оболочку и лишает этим
   бактерий питательной среды. Позднее затвердевшая слизистая заменяется
   новой, здоровой тканью.

Значение и применение[править | править код]

   Дубовый строевой и поделочный лес дают главным образом названные
   русско-европейские виды. Из остальных видов дуба всего важнее Дуб
   пробковый (Quercus suber), растущий в южной Франции, Испании, Алжире, на
   Черноморском побережье Кавказа. Он замечателен необыкновенно толстым слоем
   пробки, образующимся в его коре. Слой этот бывает в несколько сантиметров
   толщиной и идёт на приготовление бутылочных пробок. Снятие этого
   пробкового слоя начинается с 10- или 15-летних деревьев. Первая пробка не
   годится, но через 8—12 лет нарастает новая, которая и идёт в дело. После
   второй съёмки снимается через известный промежуток времени третий слой
   и т. д.

   Вечнозелёный Дуб каменный (Quercus ilex), растущий в Италии и в
   средиземной области вообще, даёт сладкие жёлуди, употребляемые в пищу. Тем
   же отличаются многие дубы на востоке и в тёплых странах Америки, особенно
   в Калифорнии, они широко использовались в пищу американскими индейцами.
   Кроме того, жёлуди идут на корм скоту. Жёлуди дубов, произрастающих на
   территории России, идут только на приготовление желудёвого кофе.

   Также под дубами, образуя симбиотическую связь с их корневой системой,
   растут самые дорогие грибы — трюфели.

  Кофейный напиток из желудей[править | править код]

   Порошок для кофейного напитка можно приготовить как заранее, так и
   использовать свежий. Следует учитывать, что заранее приготовленный порошок
   достаточно быстро теряет аромат вследствие испарения и разрушения входящих
   в него масел. Для приготовления свежемолотого кофейного напитка специально
   заготовленные и приготовленные жёлуди перемалывают в кофемолке и варят как
   кофе. Заготавливаются спелые, крупные жёлуди зелёного цвета, твёрдые на
   ощупь, так как мягкие, продавливающиеся пальцем — червивые. Один из
   вариантов сушки: промытые жёлуди разложить на противне в один слой и
   поставить в разогретую духовку. За это время большинство желудей лопнет от
   испарения внутри влаги и приобретёт тёмно-коричневый цвет. Через десять
   минут вынуть и вышелушить жёлуди из скорлупы. Для приготовления порошка
   кофейного напитка жёлуди, пока они горячие, прокрутить через мясорубку и
   получившийся «фарш» разложить на противнях для дальнейшей сушки в духовке
   при открытой дверце. Хранить в тёмном месте, в герметично закрытой банке,
   либо в гигроскопичном полотняном или бумажном мешочке.

  В декоративном садоводстве[править | править код]

   Дубы часто высаживают для озеленения городов; так, Дуб болотный (Quercus
   palustris) — одна из наиболее популярных пород на востоке США и в Европе,
   а вечнозелёный Дуб виргинский (Quercus virginiana^[en]) — на юге США. В
   XVIII—XIX веках дуб часто использовался как солитер в дворцовых и
   усадебных парках. В этом случае его обычно сажали на поляне перед
   господским домом.

   В Крыму и на Кавказе можно с успехом выращивать дуб пробковый (Quercus
   suber).

Дубы-памятники и охраняемые дубы[править | править код]

   Существует множество отдельных деревьев из рода дуб, получивших широкую
   известность либо из-за своего возраста, или размера, или по иным
   уникальным причинам. Многие из них считаются достопримечательностями и
   находятся под охраной. Среди них можно отметить: Мамврийский дуб,
   Стелмужский дуб, Панский дуб, Царь-дуб, Дуб кайзера, Дуб-часовня, Богатырь
   Тавриды, 600-летний дуб, Гранитский дуб.

     * Во Франции растёт дуб, в дупле которого устроена небольшая комната
       шириной около трёх с половиной метров. В самой толстой стенке дупла
       вырезана небольшая скамейка. Через небольшое оконце в каморку
       проникает дневной свет. По самым скромным подсчётам, гигантскому дубу
       более двух тысяч лет^[7]^:41.
     * По преданию, православный монах Тихон жил до основания монастыря в
       дупле могучего дуба. Монастырь, основанный им, носит имя Тихонова
       пустынь^[7]^:41.
     * В одном болгарском селе молния попала в древний дуб и дерево сгорело
       дотла. Когда местные жители стали разносить золу по своим огородам, то
       обнаружили в ней металлический сосуд, полный золотых турецких монет.
       Этим монетам было более трёхсот лет. Клад, по-видимому, был спрятан в
       дупле могучего дерева. И если бы молния обошла его стороной, то дуб до
       сих пор хранил бы свою тайну^[7]^:44.

Дуб в культуре[править | править код]

  Музыка[править | править код]

   Волшебная флейта из оперы В. А. Моцарта вырезана из древесины
   тысячелетнего дуба. Волшебная флейта превращается затем в золотую.

   [IMG]От др.-греч. Δρυς — «дуб» произошло имя нимф Дриад — покровительниц
   деревьев в греческой мифологии^[9].

  Устное народное творчество[править | править код]

   В космическом миросозерцании славян мировое древо трансформировалось в
   фольклорный образ дуба, растущего на острове Буяне, посреди Океана-моря.
   «На Море-Океане, на Острове Буяне стоит дуб зелёный», — так начинаются
   многие русские народные сказки^[10]. По поверьям древних славян, в дупле
   древнего дуба живёт змей Змиулан, воплощающий стихию огня. Он может
   внушить любовь женщине, чтобы вступить с ней в брак. В качестве свадебного
   подарка змей приносит драгоценности, которые он достаёт через дупло из
   подземных кладовых. За помощью к Змиулану обращались мужчины, желающие
   внушить любовь к своей избраннице. На Руси бытовало поверье, что в дупле
   огромного дуба обитает Никола Дуплинский. И если ему усердно помолиться,
   то он выполнит любое желание^[7]^:40—41.

   У некоторых народов считалось, что поваленные бурей дуплистые деревья
   могут возвращать человеку молодость и приносить здоровье. Таким деревом в
   поэме Г. Лонгфелло «Песнь о Гайавате» оказывается дуб:

   На пути их, в дебрях леса
   Дуб лежал, погибший в бурю,
   Дуб-гигант, покрытый мохом,
   Полусгнивший под листвою,
   Почерневший и дуплистый.
   Увидав его, Осезо
   Испустил вдруг крик тоскливый
   И в дупло, как в яму, прыгнул.
   Старым, грязным, безобразным,
   Он упал в него, а вышел —
   Сильным, стройным и высоким, статным юношей, красавцем!^[7]^:41

   Король Падуб и Король Дуб — выделяемый Робертом Грейвсом архетип в
   европейском фольклоре, извечные противники, каждому из которых принадлежит
   половина года.

  Народные приметы[править | править код]

     * Дуб перед ясенем лист пустит — к сухому лету^[11].
     * Много желудей на дубе — к строгой зиме^[11].
     * Не сей пшеницы прежде дубового листа^[12].
     * Холодно, оттого что лист дуба развёртывается^[11].
     * Шумит зимой дубравушка — к непогодушке^[11].

  Пословицы и поговорки[править | править код]

   Русская народная пословица гласит: «Что ни дуб, то тулуп, что ни сосёнка,
   то избёнка»^[7]^:59. А советская пословица иронически обыгрывает крепость
   дуба: «Чем больше в армии дубов — тем крепче наша оборона».

   Английские:

     * Большие дубы вырастают из маленьких желудей. — англ. Great oaks from
       little acorns grow.
     * Буря валит дубы, а тростник не может сломать. — Oaks may fall when
       reeds stand the storm.

  Символика[править | править код]

   В Древней Греции дуб был посвящён Зевсу^[13] и Гераклу. Он является
   символом душевной и физической силы, а также долголетия^[14]. Дубовая
   ветвь символизировала силу, мощь и знатность рода, дубовыми венками
   награждали самых храбрых воинов. Крупные экземпляры дуба считались
   статуями Зевса. В Древнем Риме дуб был посвящён Юпитеру^[13], жёлуди
   назывались юпитеровыми плодами. Человека, спасшего жизнь римскому
   гражданину, принято было награждать дубовым венком, называвшимся corona
   civica^[15].

   У славян дуб олицетворял силу, мощь и был посвящён Перуну. Его называли
   Перуново дерево.

   У древних тевтонцев и литовцев бог дуба был богом грома, посылавшим дождь
   и оплодотворяющим землю.

   Кельты видели в нём символ выносливости и победоносности. Галлы
   рассматривали дуб в качестве оси мира^[14].

   В революционную эпоху во Франции дуб, в память о галльской традиции,
   символизировал свободу, надежду и преемственность. Его экземпляры были
   объявлены общественными памятниками, охраняемыми законом, у их подножия
   крестьяне сжигали помещичьи ценные бумаги, под их сенью подписывали важные
   документы и произносили гражданские клятвы^[14]^:103.

  Геральдика[править | править код]

   Изображение дуба можно увидеть на гербах городов и административных
   единиц.

   Клён (лат. Ácer) — род древесных растений семейства Сапиндовые
   (Sapindaceae), ранее помещался в семейство Клёновые (Aceraceae)^[3]^[4],
   которое ныне рассматривается в ранге трибы Клёновые (Acereae) в составе
   подсемейства Конскокаштановые (Hippocastanoideae).

   Клён широко распространён в Европе, Азии и Северной Америке. В словаре В.
   И. Даля указано: «Клён м. родовое названье дерев Асеr, обычно разумеют A.
   platanoides, русский клён»^[5].

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   Большинство видов клёна представляют собой деревья 10—40 метров высотой,
   но среди них встречаются и кустарники 5—10 метров высотой с рядом
   небольших веток, растущих от основания ствола.

   В основном листопадные растения, и только несколько видов из Южной Азии и
   Средиземноморья — вечнозелёные.

   Листья супротивные, у большинства видов дланевидные (пальчатые), с
   нечётным количеством жилок на каждой лопасти (их количество варьирует от
   трёх до девяти), одна из которых проходит посередине. Лишь у немногих
   видов листья сложно-пальчатые, сложно-перистые, с перистым жилкованием или
   без лопастей.

   У нескольких видов, таких как Клён серый (Acer griseum), Клён
   трёхцветковый (Acer triflorum), Клён маньчжурский (Acer mandshuricum) и
   Клён Максимовича (Acer maximowiczianum), листья тройчатые (трилистники). У
   клёна ясенелистного (Acer negundo) листья сложно-перистые и могут состоять
   из трёх, пяти, семи, редко девяти листиков. У клёна граболистного (Acer
   carpinifolium) листья простые и с перистым жилкованием, напоминают
   грабовые.

   [IMG]Цветок клёна остролистного с нектарным кольцом

   Цветки с пятью симметрично расположенными лепестками, собраны в кисть,
   щиток или зонтик. Они имеют пять чашелистиков, пять лепестков от 1 до 6 мм
   длиной, двенадцать тычинок 6—10 мм и два пестика разных типов. Завязь
   расположена выше и имеет два плодолистика, чьи крылышки вытягиваются из
   цветка — по этому признаку легко определить, какой цветок является
   женским. Клёны цветут в конце зимы или ранней весной, у большинства видов
   сразу после появления листьев, а у некоторых и до. Цветки зелёные, жёлтые,
   оранжевые или красные, и хотя каждый из них очень мал, при цветении
   некоторых видов у человека при взгляде издалека возникает впечатление
   полностью цветущего дерева.

   Нектарник представляет собой плоское кольцо и расположен между лепестками
   и тычинками^[6]^:35, у клёна остролистного он простирается до завязи, и
   основания тычинок погружены в него^[7]^:358.

   Плод, называемый двукрылаткой, состоит из двух одинаковых частей и при
   падении вращается, унося семя на значительное расстояние. Плод созревает в
   промежутке от двух до шести недель после цветения.

Распространение[править | править код]

   Клёны широко распространены в Северном полушарии, от полярных областей
   Европы и Северной Америки до тропических районов Центральной Америки и
   Южной Азии. В основном распространены в умеренных широтах, в тропиках
   известны только несколько видов, а в Южном полушарии только один вид —
   Клён лавровый (Acer laurinum), который доходит до острова Тимор в
   Индонезии (10° южной широты). На территории Африки клёны присутствуют
   только на самом севере, вдоль побережья Средиземного моря, а в Южной
   Америке и Австралии отсутствуют вовсе.

   На территории Российской Федерации известны около двадцати видов клёнов,
   среди которых широко распространены Клён остролистный (Acer platanoides),
   Клён татарский (Acer tataricum), Клён полевой (Acer campestre) и Клён
   белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus). В основном они растут в
   европейской части России, а в Сибири очень распространён завезённый из
   Северной Америки Клён ясенелистный, или американский (Acer negundo), очень
   агрессивный инвазионный вид. В Красную книгу России занесён Клён японский
   (Acer japonicum).

   Клёны в южной части ареала в основном предпочитают горные районы,
   поднимаясь в высоту до 3000 м над уровнем моря в Гималаях. На равнинах
   растёт относительно небольшое количество видов. Растут эти деревья
   поодиночке либо небольшими группами, самостоятельные леса образуют крайне
   редко.

   В европейской части России растут четыре вида:

     * Клён татарский (Acer tataricum L.),
     * Клён белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus L.),
     * Клён полевой (Acer campestre L.) — занесён в Красную книгу
       Подмосковья, через которое проходит северная граница его ареала,
     * Клён остролистный (Acer platanoides L.),

   из которых только последний вид распространён обширно (на север — до 62°).

   На Дальнем Востоке России встречаются:

     * Клён мелколистный (Acer mono),
     * Клён приречный (Acer ginnala),
     * Клён ложнозибольдов (Acer pseudosieboldianum), в Приморском крае
       найден клён микрозибольдов^[8], вероятно, являющийся разновидностью
       клёна ложнозибольдова,
     * Клён-берёза, или Клён жёлтый (Acer ukurunduense) — в Приморье и
       Приамурье,
     * Клён зеленокорый (Acer tegmentosum) и
     * Клён маньчжурский (Acer mandshuricum) — в основном в Приморье,
     * Клён японский (Acer japonicum) — на Курилах (Кунашир),
     * Клён бородатый (Acer barbinerve Maxim.),
     * Клён Чоноски (Acer tschonoskii Maxim.) — юг Сахалинской области, в
       Приморье растёт его подвид (?) клён Комарова,

   В Крыму известны только:

     * Acer campestre L.,
     * Acer valum Lauth. (Acer opulifolium Vill.),
     * Acer platanoides L.,
     * Клён Стевена (Acer stevenii Pojark)^[9].

   Кавказ очень богат видами клёна — кроме перечисленных выше европейских
   видов, здесь также встречаются:

     * Клён Траутфеттера, или высокогорный (Acer trautvetteri Medw.)
     * Acer velutinum Boiss. — в России вид не отмечен,
     * Клён гирканский (Acer hyrcanum Fisch. et C.A.Mey.) — Азербайджан и
       Дагестан,
     * Клён монпелийский (Acer monspessulanum L.),
     * Клён колхидский (Acer cappadocicum Gled.),
     * Клён Сосновского (Acer sosnowskyi Doluch.) — включён в Красную книгу
       Краснодарского края.

   Близкий к ложноплатановому клёну вид, Acer ambiguum Heer, известен из
   олигоцена в Гренландии и Шпицбергене и из миоцена на Сахалине, а в
   плиоценовых отложениях он найден на Алтае. Здесь же найдены близкий к Acer
   lobelii Ten. или тождественный с ним Acer laetum C.A.Mey. и Acer
   nordenskioldi Nath., который И. Ф. Шмальгаузен соединяет с современным
   японским клёном дланевидным (Acer palmatum Thunb.).

   На территории Евразии сформировал обширный вторичный ареал также Клён
   ясенелистный (Acer negundo L.), родом из Северной Америки. Ранее широко
   использовался в России в озеленении парков, садов, скверов в городах
   центральных областей европейской части России, Сибири, Средней Азии и
   Дальнего Востока. Сейчас распространяется самосевом.

Болезни и вредители[править | править код]

   [IMG]Гриб Rhytisma acerinum на листьях клёна белого

   Листья клёнов поедают личинки многих видов чешуекрылых (см. Список видов
   чешуекрылых, питающихся клёнами). Тля также очень часто поселяется на этих
   деревьях. При разведении клёнов в культуре с насекомыми борются
   распылением диметоата.

   В США и Канаде все виды клёна поражаются азиатским усачом (Anoplophora
   glabripennis). Результатом заражения этим вредителем стала гибель тысяч
   клёнов и других видов деревьев в Иллинойсе, Массачусетсе, Нью-Джерси и
   штате Нью-Йорк.

   Клёны подвержены различным грибковым заболеваниям. Для многих характерно
   вертициллёзное увядание, вызванное различными видами грибков рода
   Verticillium  (англ.) (рус., которое может наносить большой ущерб
   популяции клёнов. Чёрная плесень коры, вызываемая видами Cryptostroma,
   может убить деревья, которые подвержены стрессу из-за сухости. Изредка
   клёны гибнут из-за корневой гнили, вызванной видами Phytophthora или
   Ganoderma (Ганодерма). Поздним летом и осенью листья клёнов обычно
   испещрены «смоляными пятнами», причиной которых являются виды Rhytisma, и
   мучнистой росой, вызываемой видами Uncinula, однако эти болезни обычно не
   наносят существенного и долговременного ущерба здоровью деревьев^[10].

Использование[править | править код]

   См. также: Клён (древесина)
   [IMG]Древесина клёна

   Клёны ценятся в декоративном садоводстве и паркостроении за красоту кроны,
   зимний цвет коры, ажурную листву, яркий осенний наряд. Почти все виды
   клёнов используются как декоративные деревья, часто в качестве солитера в
   ландшафтном дизайне.

   Некоторые виды клёна используются для получения кленового сиропа и сахара.
   В весеннем кленовом соке содержится сахар, содержание его — 3 %. Поскольку
   у клёна сахарного (Acer saccharum) сок ещё слаще — более чем 4 %, — именно
   он используется в промышленных масштабах для производства сахара (особенно
   широко в Канаде, вследствие чего клён стал туристической
   достопримечательностью этой страны). Сок собирают обычным методом надрезки
   ствола, затем уваривают до сиропа. У кленового сахара свой вкус, и многие
   предпочитают его свекловичному и иным видам сахара.

   В качестве древесины в Северной Америке используют клён сахарный, в Европе
   клён белый, или псевдоплатановый (Acer pseudoplatanus). Тяжёлая, твёрдая,
   плотная и прочная мелкопористая древесина клёна обладает красивым
   рисунком, формируемым узкими тёмными сердцевинными лучами, придающими ей
   особую декоративность. Древесина клёна использовалась в столярном деле для
   изготовления гнутой мебели, музыкальных инструментов (барабаны, гитары,
   скрипки, духовые инструменты), линеек, лыж, прялок, кулаков мельничных
   колёс, ружейных лож; клён шёл на сапожные гвозди, мясные колоды, ободья,
   топорища (лучшие — из клёна татарского). В старину из клёна мастерили
   кухонные приборы и вёсла. Из клёна сахарного изготавливают кегли для
   боулинга, бейсбольные биты (хотя и реже, чем из ясеня или гикори).

   Древесина отдельных видов обладает декоративной волнистой текстурой,
   которую можно определить только при распиле. Её используют для
   производства шпона, для декоративной отделки мебели.

   Клён — отличный медонос. Клёны являются важными источниками пыльцы и
   нектара для пчёл ранней весной. Поскольку клёны крайне важны для выживания
   пчёл, их часто высаживают возле пасек.

   Листьями клёна питаются личинки многих видов бабочек.

   Я́блоня (лат. Mālus) — род листопадных деревьев и кустарников семейства
   Розовые (Rosaceae) с шаровидными сладкими или кисло-сладкими плодами.
   Происходит из зон умеренного климата Северного полушария.

   Род относится к трибе Яблоневые (Maleae) подсемейства Сливовые
   (Prunoideae)^[1]. Насчитывает 62 вида (2013)^[2]. Наиболее распространены:
   яблоня домашняя, или культурная (Malus domestica), к которой относится
   большинство возделываемых в мире сортов (число которых превышает 10
   тысяч^[3]), яблоня сливолистная, китайская (Malus prunifolia) и яблоня
   низкая (Malus pumila).

   [IMG]Яблоневый сад [IMG]Яблоки

   Многие виды яблони выращивают в качестве декоративных растений в садах и
   парках, используют в полезащитном лесоразведении. Все виды — хорошие
   медоносы. Древесина у яблони плотная, крепкая, легко режется и хорошо
   полируется; пригодна для токарных и столярных изделий, мелких поделок^[4].

Название[править | править код]

   Русское слово яблоко возникло в результате прибавления протетического
   начального j- к праслав. *ablъko; последнее образовано с помощью суффикса
   -ъk- от позднепраиндоевропейской основы *āblu- "яблоко" (к той же основе
   восходят лит. obuolỹs, латыш. ābols, англ. apple, нем. Apfel, галльск.
   avallo, др.‑ирл. aball^[5]^[6]). Данная основа представляет собой
   регионализм северо-западных индоевропейских языков и восходит, в свою
   очередь, к общеиндоевропейской основе (реконструируемой как *(a)masl-^[7]
   или как *ŝamlu-^[6]). С суффиксом -onь- та же основа дала яблонь
   (позднейшее яблоня)^[8].

   [IMG]Яблоня домашняя. Ботаническая иллюстрация из книги О. В. Томе Flora
   von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, 1885

   Латинские слова mālum ‘яблоко’ и mālus ‘яблоня’ также восходят к пра-и.е.
   *(a)masl-/*ŝamlu-^[7].

Ботаническое описание[править | править код]

   Деревья с развесистой кроной высотой 2,5—15 м. Ветви — укороченные
   (плодущие), на которых закладываются цветочные почки, и удлинённые
   (ростовые). У дикорастущих видов на ветвях имеются колючки.

   Листья черешковые, голые или опушённые снизу, с опадающими или остающимися
   прилистниками.

   Цветки собраны в немногоцветковые полузонтиковидные или щитковидные
   соцветия. Окраска цветков может изменяться от совершенно белой до
   нежно-розовой и ярко-малиновой^[4]. Цветки яблони протогиничны: гинецей
   созревает раньше андроцея. Опыляются насекомыми^[3].

   Плод — яблоко, возникающее из нижней завязи. Гинецей заключён в нижнюю
   завязь^[4]. По мере формирования плода плодолистики становятся
   хрящеватыми, пергаментными, кожистыми. На разрезе плода чётко видна
   граница между тканями гипантия и тканями завязи, очерченная окружностью
   более плотно расположенных клеток и сосудистых пучков^[3].

   Формула цветка: [IMG] \ast Ca_{5}\;Co_{5}\;A_{{(5+5)}}\;G_{{(\overline
   5)}}^[9].

Распространение[править | править код]

   Всего на территории бывшего СССР известно свыше десяти видов. Из
   дикорастущих видов в лесах Европейской части и на Кавказе произрастает
   яблоня лесная (Malus sylvestris); в Малой Азии, Иране, Крыму и на
   Кавказе — яблоня восточная (Malus orientalis); в Китае, Монголии,
   Приморском крае, Восточной Сибири — яблоня ягодная (Malus baccata); в
   лесах Тянь-Шаня — яблоня Недзвецкого (Malus niedzwetzkyana), в
   окрестностях Алма-Аты — яблоня Сиверса (Malus sieversii), дикий предок
   многих культурных сортов яблок.

История разведения[править | править код]

   [IMG]Яблони в период цветения

   Дикорастущими яблоками предки современного человека питались всегда.
   Родиной одомашненной яблони является территория современного южного
   Казахстана и Киргизии (предгорья Алатау), где до сих пор встречается в
   диком виде яблоня Сиверса, от которой и произошла яблоня
   домашняя^[10]^[11]. Предположительно, оттуда во времена Александра
   Македонского либо во время иных миграций она попала в Европу. По другой
   версии, это фруктовое дерево первоначально произрастало в районе между
   Каспийским и Чёрным морями, а уже оттуда было завезено в другие районы
   мира^[12]^[неавторитетный источник]. Обугленные остатки яблони обнаружены
   при раскопках доисторических озёрных стоянок Швейцарии; по-видимому,
   жители Европы хорошо знали яблоню ещё во времена неолита, но одомашнивание
   её в данной части света произошло значительно позднее^[6].

   Колыбелью яблоневодства в Европе была Древняя Греция. Писатели Древнего
   Рима — Катон, Варрон, Колумелла, Плиний Старший — описывали 36 сортов
   яблони, выращиваемых в их время^[13]. В европейской культуре яблоня быстро
   заняла важное место. Общеевропейским можно считать мотив «золотых яблок»,
   якобы дарующих бессмертие и вечную молодость и потому часто
   похищаемых^[6]. Даже слово «рай» по-кельтски звучит как Авалон («страна
   яблок»)^[13].

   В русских землях культурная яблоня впервые появилась в XI веке в
   монастырских садах Киевской Руси; так, при Ярославе Мудром (в 1051 году)
   был заложен яблоневый сад, позже известный как сад Киево-Печерской
   лавры^[14]. В XVI веке яблоня появилась и в северных районах Руси. Для
   выведения культурных сортов яблони были использованы четыре её вида:
   яблоня низкая, яблоня лесная, яблоня ягодная и яблоня сливолистная, или
   китайская.

   [IMG]Яблоки

   Размер красных, зелёных или жёлтых шаровидных плодов в зависимости от вида
   может быть с горошину или достигать 15 см в диаметре.

   По времени созревания отличают летние, осенние и зимние сорта, более
   поздние сорта отличаются хорошей стойкостью.

   Плоды содержат яблочную, винную, лимонную и другие органические кислоты,
   сахара (глюкозу, сахарозу и другие), витамины С, А, В1, каротин, дубильные
   и пектиновые вещества, микроэлементы (железо, медь), макроэлементы (калий,
   кальций, магний и другие), эфирное масло, и другие вещества.

   Плоды употребляют в свежем виде и в виде сухофруктов; они пригодны также
   для различных видов переработки: получения соков, компотов, киселей и
   плодового вина, сидра, приготовления варенья, а благодаря содержанию
   пектина — джемов, повидла, желе и мусса. Яблоки запекают с сахаром в
   тесте, приготовляют начинки для пирогов, тортов и пирожных, очень
   популярны яблочные пироги.

   Сушёные яблоки являются хорошим источником легкоусваиваемых сахаров
   (содержат от 8 до 15 %), микроэлементов (до 0,5 % различных минеральных
   солей), а в семенах одного среднего плода содержится около суточной нормы
   йода

   Например, яблоки антоновского сорта в 100 граммах при калорийности в 48
   ккал содержат: 0,3 г белков, 11,5 г углеводов, 0,02 мг витамина B1, 4,9 мг
   витамина С, 16 мг кальция и 86 мг калия.

   Плоды дикорастущих видов в основном перерабатывают.

   Некоторые известные сорта:

     * Апорт
     * Бабушкино
     * Мекинтош
     * Слава переможцам

   Ещё более 200 видовых названий этого рода (в том числе, к примеру, Malus
   bhutanica J.B.Phipps) имеют в The Plant List (2013) статус unresolved
   name, то есть относительно этих названий нельзя однозначно сказать,
   следует ли их использовать как названия самостоятельных видов — либо их
   следует свести в синонимику других таксонов^[2].

   Раньше иногда также выделяли вид Яблоня гибридная (Malus hybridus).

Гибридные роды[править | править код]

   Гибридные роды с участием представителей рода Яблоня:

     * ×Malosorbus — Малосорбус (= Sorbus × Malus)
     * ×Marus — Марюс (= Pyrus × Malus). Яблоне-грушевые межродовые гибриды
     * ×Malonia — Малония (= Cydonia × Malus). Яблоне-айвовые межродовые
       гибриды

Культивирование[править | править код]

   724—743 гг.

   Яблони разводят в большинстве областей с умеренным климатом. Среди всех
   плодовых растений умеренных широт яблоне принадлежит первое место по
   площади посадок и по урожаям. Немало сортов яблонь дают урожай по тонне
   плодов с одного дерева и выше^[16].

   В современных садах практически все яблони состоят из двух компонентов:
   подвоя (корневая система и корневая шейка) и сращенного с ним посредством
   прививки или окулировки сортового привоя (штамб и крона). При закладке
   современных интенсивных садов с высотой деревьев 2-3 метра, используются
   карликовые и полукарликовые клоновые подвои яблони^[17].

   Коммерческие сады размещены в местах, где не бывает экстремальных
   температур, почвы плодородны и достаточно воды для полива. Главные мировые
   производители плодов — Германия, Италия, Франция, Испания, Китай, Япония,
   США, Канада, Аргентина, Чили, Австралия, Новая Зеландия и ЮАР. Примерно
   половина продаваемых яблок приходится на сорта «Delicious» и «Golden
   Delicious», которые наиболее распространены в США. Оба этих сорта могут
   расти в широком диапазоне условий.

   В садах средней полосы России выращивают: ранние «Китайка золотая»
   (мичуринский сорт), «Грушовка московская» (старинный вид), «Папировка» или
   «Белый налив» (отличается особенно сладким и крепким плодом); осенние
   «Коричное полосатое» (плод хорошо сохраняет форму в варенье), «Анисы»
   (старинные русские сорта), «Бельфлёр-китайка» (мичуринский десертный,
   лучший среди осенних сортов); а наиболее популярен зимний — «Антоновка»
   (старинный русский сорт хороший свежим, для любой переработки и хранения
   плодом).

   Джонсона Хеда (1819—1904)

   В садах южной полосы выделяются: устойчивыми к хранению плодами сорт —
   «Розмарин», ароматный десертный «Белый зимний кальвиль»; многочисленные
   ренеты: «Бумажный ренет», «Красный шафран», «Полосатый шафран»; синапы:
   «Кандиль-синап», «Сары-синап»; «Апорт» (особенно качественный
   алма-атинский).

История[править | править код]

   Пифагор, доказывая свою знаменитую теорему, построил фигуру, где на
   сторонах прямоугольного треугольника расположены квадраты. Впервые дерево
   Пифагора построил А. Е. Босман (1891—1961) во время Второй мировой войны,
   используя обычную чертёжную линейку.^[источник не указан 3781 день]

Особенности[править | править код]

   Одним из свойств дерева Пифагора является то, что если площадь первого
   квадрата равна единице, то на каждом уровне сумма площадей квадратов тоже
   будет равна единице.

   Если в классическом дереве Пифагора угол равен 45 градусам, то также можно
   построить и обобщённое дерево Пифагора при использовании других углов.
   Такое дерево часто называют обдуваемое ветром дерево Пифагора. Если
   изображать только отрезки, соединяющие каким-либо образом выбранные
   «центры» треугольников, то получается обнаженное дерево Пифагора.

                                Рубрика: Деревья

   Деревья входят одну из самых больших групп древесных растений. Являются
   крупными представителями флоры с многолетним стволом, который способен
   развиваться на протяжении долгого времени. Подразделяются на 2 базовые
   породы.

   Хвойные — это ели, лиственницы, сосны, пихты, кипарисы, секвойи, тсуги,
   туи, можжевельники, кедры. Лиственные — эвкалипты, ясени, буки, клены,
   тополи, платаны, абаши, березы, дубы и многие другие.

   Еще один критерий классификации — продолжительность жизни листьев, исходя
   из чего они бывают вечнозелеными или листопадными. Также имеется еще одно
   крупное разделение деревьев на несколько сортов: плодовые (их фрукты и
   ягоды предназначены для пищи), ценные (идут на
   промышленно-производственные цели), корабельные (используются для
   постройки судов), тропические (произрастают на экваторе и близ него),
   северные (распространены далеко от экваториальной зоны).

   При этом древесина лиственных пород намного тверже и располагает рядом
   преимуществ. Она почти не подвержена гниению, красивее по рисунку, но в то
   же время гораздо тяжелее. Подходит для интерьерных и мебельных работ.

   У хвойных рисунок менее экспрессивный, а сам ствол изобилует смоляными
   карманами. Однако это незаменимый строительный материал с массой
   декоративных и отделочных возможностей.

Какое дерево самое легкое в мире?

   Деревья удивительны. Одни поражают невероятным рисунком, другие —
   твердостью, третьи — малым весом. Например, самое легкое дерево человек
   может запросто унести самостоятельно — даже если…

   деревья

                              16 фактов о деревьях

   Зачем сажать деревья и в чём их польза для человека и окружающей среды?
   Сколько они производят кислорода и как образуют облака?

   Выделяют кислород

  1.

   Чем дерево крупнее и старше, тем больше кислорода. В среднем человек
   вдыхает около 550 л кислорода в день — такой объём производят два взрослых
   дуба

   Очищают воздух

  2.

   Деревья поглощают вредные химические вещества и задерживают частицы дыма,
   пыли и золы. Благодаря этому воздух становится чище, снижается риск
   респираторных заболеваний. Содержание пыли в воздухе на озеленённой улице
   в три раза меньше, чем на улице без деревьев

   Укрепляют иммунитет

  3.

   Леса — источник продуктов питания, в которых много полезных питательных
   веществ. Грибы, мёд, фрукты, орехи и семена в рационе повышают
   разнообразие микрофлоры кишечника, что важно для поддержания иммунитета

   Борются с вирусами и бактериями

  4.

   Деревья вырабатывают фитонциды — вещества, подавляющие вирусы и бактерии.
   Например, 1 га зарослей можжевельника выделяет в сутки до 30 кг
   фитонцидов — это примерно в шесть раз больше, чем другие хвойные породы,
   и в 15 раз больше, чем лиственные деревья

   Улучшают настроение

  5.

   Прогулки в парках и лесах дарят положительные эмоции, снижают уровень
   усталости и стресса. Они помогают восстановить силы и улучшают
   концентрацию внимания

   Защищают от ультрафио-
   лета

  6.

   Деревья уменьшают воздействие ультрафиолетовых лучей типа UVB примерно
   на 50%. Это особенно важно для мест, где взрослые и дети проводят много
   времени на открытом воздухе

   Снижают температуру воздуха

  7.

   Тень от деревьев на домах и дорогах улиц может уменьшить температуру
   воздуха на 4-5 ℃

   Снижают уровень шума

  8.

   Зелёные насаждения помогают решить проблему шумового загрязнения
   в городах. Одно зрелое дерево может снизить шум до 6 децибел. Кроны
   лиственных пород поглощают около 26% попадающей на них звуковой энергии,
   отражают и рассеивают около 74%

   Замедляют изменения климата

  9.

   В солнечные дни 1 га леса поглощает за сутки 220–280 кг углекислого газа —
   это объём выбросов, которые генерируют 18–23 легковых автомобилей за один
   день

   Служат домом для животных и растений

  10.

   В лесу соседствуют насекомые, млекопитающие, грибы, мхи и другие растения.
   На разных видах деревьев обитает более 280 видов насекомых, которыми
   питаются птицы и хищники

   Мешают паводкам

  11.

   Деревья поддерживают запасы подземных вод и снижают риск обильных
   паводков. Весной в лесу снег тает постепенно, глубоко проникая в почву.
   Поэтому паводки в лесной зоне не такие сильные, как на лугах и полях

   Собирают дождевую воду

  12.

   Во время дождя кроны помогают распределить поток воды. Она стекает
   по ветвям и стволу к корням и частично впитывается в почву. Так деревья
   помогают снизить масштабы затоплений или вовсе их избежать

   Сохраняют здоровье почвы

  13.

   Леса поддерживают плодородность почвы. Опавшая с деревьев листва
   разлагается и возвращает в почву органические вещества. В то же время
   развитые корни деревьев защищают верхние слои почвы от разрушения ветром
   и водой

   Создают облака

  14.

   Благодаря лесу образуются облака. Деревья выделяют водяной пар через
   листья. Он поднимается в атмосферу и превращается в дождевые облака

   Растут дольше, чем люди

  15.

   Саженец сосны растёт в среднем по 50–70 см в год. Чтобы вырасти до зрелого
   25-метрового дерева, ему потребуется не менее 30 лет. Ежегодно люди
   вырубают около 10 млн га лесов. Новые деревья не успевают вырастать,
   поэтому важно помогать лесу восстанавливать запасы

   Бонус

   Переработка макулатуры сохраняет ресурсы

  16.

   Тонна переработанной бумаги сохраняет 17 деревьев, около 32 тыс. л воды
   и 4000 кВт электроэнергии

   ДЕРЕВО, многолетнее растение с одревесневающим прямостоячим главным
   стеблем – стволом. Более детальное или четкое определение этой «жизненной
   форме» дать трудно из-за разнообразия размеров и внешнего вида растений,
   которые называют деревьями. Даже банан, например, часто считают деревом,
   хотя стебель у него травянистый. Иногда в определении дерева специально
   подчеркивают, что его ствол последовательно разделяется на все более
   тонкие ветви или что у дерева есть четкая облиственная крона. Однако
   стволы большинства пальм вообще не ветвятся, а у гигантских кактусов
   одревесневший ствол, если и несет боковые ветви, никакой кроной не
   увенчивается.

   Многие определения устанавливают минимальную высоту растения, которое
   можно назвать деревом, но у разных авторов этот показатель колеблется от 2
   до 6 м. Иногда эту жизненную форму приписывают всему виду, а в других
   случаях – только определенным экземплярам конкретного таксона. Так,
   стелющиеся растения в высокогорьях или Арктике можно называть деревьями,
   поскольку при более благоприятных условиях представители этого вида
   прямостоячие и довольно высокие. В других случаях растение не превышает в
   высоту нескольких дециметров, например в питомнике или в декоративной
   карликовой форме, созданной школой бонзай, однако по всем прочим признакам
   соответствует дереву. Все экземпляры, соответствующие в зрелом состоянии
   классическому дереву, начинают свое естественное развитие с семени или
   крошечного вегетативного проростка. В связи с этим встает вопрос: с какого
   момента их можно считать деревьями.

   Для некоторых целей могут потребоваться довольно жесткие определения,
   однако в целом термин «дерево» предполагает широкий диапазон
   интерпретаций.

Деревья и кустарники.

   СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ
   СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ

   Расплывчатость понятия «дерево», очевидно, порождает и нечеткость в
   разграничении между деревом и еще одной группой прямостоячих деревянистых
   растений – кустарниками. Считается, что у последних всегда несколько
   стволов, среди которых нельзя однозначно выделить главный. Высота
   кустарников редко превышает 3 м, хотя среди них встречаются и
   восьмиметровые. В целом, у видов, традиционно считающихся кустарниками,
   редко встречаются «древовидные» экземпляры, однако исключения известны в
   таких родах, как, например, сумах, ольха, ирга, церкокарпус, кизил, ива,
   бузина. В то же время очень многие виды, относимые к типичным деревьям,
   могут давать кустарниковые формы. Некоторые деревья, если их срубить или
   сжечь, образуют корневую или пневую поросль, которая в конечном итоге
   развивается в крупное растение с несколькими стволами, среди которых
   далеко не всегда можно указать главный. Тем не менее в этом случае
   логичнее было бы говорить не о кустарнике, а о многоствольном дереве.
   Кстати, если в лесу таких деревьев много, вполне вероятно, что он
   вырубался или горел.

Географическое распространение.

   Деревья растут на значительной части суши, а также на мелких участках
   пресных и соленых водоемов. Отсутствуют они в приполярных областях,
   высокогорьях и крайне засушливых местах. В Западном полушарии ареал этой
   жизненной формы простирается от залива Маккензи на западе Канады примерно
   на 14,5 тыс. км к югу до Огненной Земли. В Восточном полушарии деревья
   растут от полуострова Таймыр в России до новозеландского острова Южный,
   между которыми по меридиану ок. 13 тыс. км. См. также ФИТОГЕОГРАФИЯ.

   Деревья – самые крупные и самые долгоживущие из современных организмов.
   Рекордсмен по размерам – секвойядендрон (мамонтово дерево) «Генерал
   Шерман» из национального парка Секвойя в Калифорнии. В 1975 высота этого
   дерева составляла 84 м при диаметре основания ствола более 11 м. На высоте
   37 м ствол был толщиной 5 м, а самая нижняя ветвь, отходящая от ствола
   примерно на высоте 40 м, имела длину 46 м при диаметре 2,1 м. Одна эта
   ветвь превышает своими размерами многие деревья других видов. Объем
   древесины этого экземпляра составляет ок. 1400 куб. м – достаточно, чтобы
   покрыть паркетом толщиной 30 см целое футбольное поле.

   На втором месте стоит другой секвойядендрон – «Генерал Грант» из
   калифорнийского национального парка Кингс-Каньон. По данным последних
   измерений, его высота 81,5 м, диаметр основания 10,2 м, а объем древесины
   – 1219 куб. м. На западном склоне Сьерра-Невады (Калифорния) растут сотни
   секвойядендронов высотой 60–90 м.

   Шесть самых высоких в мире деревьев – секвойи, близкие родственники
   мамонтовых деревьев. Чемпион среди них растет в национальном парке Редвуд
   в Калифорнии. По данным последних измерений, его высота 111 м при диаметре
   основания 4,3 м. Прежний чемпион был в 1955 примерно на 0,3 м выше, но его
   вершину сломал ветер.

   По слухам, существуют еще более высокие – до 120 м – гиганты. Сегодня
   живые дугласии выше 100 м неизвестны, но в 1900 был якобы срублен
   экземпляр этого вида высотой 116 м. Путешественники сообщают о гигантских
   австралийских эвкалиптах, однако высота самого крупного измеренного
   представителя этого рода – эвкалипта Дальримпля, срубленного около Коласа
   в штате Виктория, оказалась «всего» 105 м, а у другого экземпляра, до сих
   пор растущего около Мельбурна, она не более 99 м.

   Самое толстое известное дерево – таксодиум, или болотный кипарис, растущий
   в городке Санта-Мария-дель-Туле около Оахаки в Мексике. Диаметр основания
   его ствола (вероятно, образованного несколькими сросшимися стволами)
   составляет 11 м. Чтобы обхватить это дерево, нужно поставить вокруг него
   20 человек с вытянутыми в стороны руками. У баобаба на одном из островов
   около Явы в Индийском океане диаметр ствола 9 м, у агатисов с Новой
   Зеландии, туй с западного побережья США и ряда других видов он достигает
   6–7,6 м. Еще один рекорд зафиксирован на западе Индии, где растет баньян
   (фикус бенгальский), у которого 350 крупных стволов и 300 более мелких.
   Вместе они занимают участок периметром 600 м, т.е. площадью ок. 2,8 га.

   Из разных регионов сообщалось о находках очень древних деревьев. Например,
   возраст некоторых макрозамий в Австралии оценивался в 12 000 лет, однако
   эти саговниковые не образуют годичных колец, так что проверить точность
   предлагаемой датировки невозможно. По имеющимся оценкам, калифорнийские
   секвойядендроны доживают до 5000 лет, но число действительно подсчитанных
   у них годичных колец пока не превышает 3200. Возможная продолжительность
   жизни африканских баобабов составляет, как полагают, ок. 4000 лет, а
   индийских баньянов – ок. 3000. Официально зафиксированный рекорд
   принадлежит сосне долговечной. Примерно 20 деревьев этого вида возрастом
   более 4000 лет растут на высоте ок. 3000 м над уровнем моря в горах
   Уайт-Маунтинс на востоке Калифорнии, причем одному из них примерно 4600
   лет. Другая группа очень древних сосен долговечных известна на горе
   Уилер-Пик в национальном парке Гумбольдт (шт. Невада).

Значение для человека.

   Деревья дают древесину для строительства домов и других сооружений,
   изготовления железнодорожных шпал и столбов электропередачи, а также для
   производства практически всей мебели и бумаги. Из древесины различными
   методами, например сухой перегонкой, экстрагированием водой или
   органическими растворителями, гидролизом и гидрированием, получают
   разнообразные химические соединения, в том числе метиловый (древесный)
   спирт, ацетон, уксусную кислоту, скипидар, сахара, дубильные вещества,
   канифоль, камфору, сассафрасовое и другие эфирные масла. К продуктам
   древесного происхождения относятся также пробка из коры средиземноморского
   дуба пробкового, латекс – млечный сок многих тропических деревьев,
   служащий сырьем для производства резины, жевательной резинки и гуттаперчи,
   капок – набивочный и теплоизоляционный материал из плодов хлопчатого
   дерева (сейбы), хинин из коры хинного дерева, растущего в южноамериканских
   Андах, и многие другие. Большие количества древесины до сих пор сжигаются
   как топливо.

   Плоды деревьев служат важным источником пищи не только для диких животных,
   но и для человека. Кофе делают из обжаренных семян кофейного дерева, какао
   и шоколад – из семян южноамериканского шоколадного дерева, пряность
   гвоздика – это сушеные бутоны тропического гвоздичного дерева, корица –
   размолотая кора коричного дерева, мускатный орех – семя мускатника родом с
   Молуккских островов на востоке Индонезии. Плоды многих деревьев мы едим в
   свежем виде.

   Потребляя в процессе фотосинтеза углекислый газ и выделяя кислород,
   деревья и их сообщества – леса, в первую очередь тропические, вносят
   огромный вклад в поддержание баланса этих газов в атмосфере Земли. К
   другим важным функциям леса относятся формирование и улучшение почвы, а
   также ее защита от эрозии. Действительно, значительная часть богатейших
   почв мира сформировалась в свое время под лесным пологом, а там, где леса
   сводятся и применяются нерациональные способы обработки почвы, плодородие
   ее быстро падает, начинается эрозия и появляются овраги. В зонах выпадения
   большого количества осадков лес – лучшая защита для почвы от
   разрушительной силы воды. Кроны деревьев смягчают ударный эффект дождевых
   капель, а лесная подстилка из опавших листьев, цветков, ветвей и другого
   мертвого растительного материала не дает воде размывать поверхность земли,
   способствует сохранению комковатой структуры грунта, впитыванию и
   удержанию им влаги, а тем самым формированию подземного водоносного
   горизонта, равномерно питающего протекающие в данном районе ручьи и реки.
   Проникновение в почву воды облегчают и многочисленные роющие животные
   лесов – дождевые черви, различные насекомые и мелкие млекопитающие.

   Леса и зеленые насаждения в целом смягчают местный климат, не давая
   солнечным лучам сильно нагревать и иссушать землю, препятствуя ее
   охлаждению, испаряя в воздух большое количество водяного пара и снижая
   скорость ветра. Тень и прохлада лесов, парков и скверов в сочетании с
   красотой их разнообразной растительности и животного мира создают
   атмосферу спокойствия и уединенности, высоко ценимую выбравшимися
   отдохнуть горожанами. Деревья, широко используемые для озеленения
   населенных пунктов, имеют не только эстетическое, климатическое и
   рекреационное значение, но и служат улавливающим пыль и вредные газы
   фильтром, а также обогащают воздух кислородом.

Основные группы деревьев.

   К деревьям принято относить и некоторые древовидные папоротники,
   гигантские кактусы и одревесневающие злаки, например бамбуки, однако
   подавляющее большинство растений, представленных этой жизненной формой, –
   хвойные и т.н. широколиственные древесные породы.

   Хвойные отличаются обычно жесткими, по большей части вечнозелеными,
   игловидными или чешуйчатыми листьями, никогда не цветут и образуют шишки
   или производные от них структуры типа можжевеловых ягод. К этой группе
   относятся, например, сосны, ели, пихты, лиственницы, кипарисы, секвойи,
   кедры, туи. Среди широколиственных деревьев достаточно упомянуть дубы,
   клены, буки, ясени, грецкие орехи, ивы, магнолии, яблони, березы, баобабы
   и эвкалипты. Все они цветут и образуют плоды. Многие виды листопадные,
   т.е. сбрасывают листву в холодное или сухое время года, но достаточно и
   вечнозеленых, особенно в тропиках и субтропиках. Термин «полулистопадный
   (полувечнозеленый) лес» означает, что часть деревьев в нем листопадные
   (обычно в верхнем ярусе), а остальные – вечнозеленые.

ОСНОВНЫЕ ЧАСТИ ДЕРЕВА

   Деревья, за исключением древовидных папоротников, – семенные растения,
   состоящие из корней, стебля, листьев и репродуктивных (половых) органов,
   т.е. шишек или цветков. Чтобы удобнее было описывать строение и функции
   каждой из этих структур, мы будем рассматривать их по отдельности, однако
   постоянно помня о неразрывной взаимосвязи и координации работы всех систем
   живого дерева.

Корневая система.

   Корни механически закрепляют ствол дерева в почве, обеспечивая его
   вертикальное положение и устойчивость на ветру. Их растущие концы,
   покрытые корневыми волосками, всасывают из почвы воду с растворенными в
   ней минеральными солями. По более старым участкам корней, а затем по
   стволу и ветвям эти вещества попадают в листья, где используются клетками
   в различных химических реакциях, включая и процесс фотосинтеза. При этом
   основную массу воды корням приходится просто «качать по кругу», так как
   огромные ее количества теряются растением при транспирации. Корни также
   накапливают питательные вещества, которые требуются дереву в период покоя
   и обеспечивают взрывообразное возобновление его роста весной (в умеренной
   и бореальной зонах) или с наступлением сезона дождей (в сухих тропиках и
   субтропиках). Важны корни и для вегетативного размножения ряда деревьев,
   например вишен, осин, берез и сассафраса. Они образуют корневые отпрыски,
   т.е. дочерние побеги, которые могут развиться в крупные деревья,
   генетически идентичные материнскому (клон).

   Существует два основных типа корневых систем. У большинства дубов,
   некоторых сосен (например, жесткой и болотной) и многих других деревьев
   эта система стержневая: основание ствола переходит в крупный вертикальный
   корень, который постепенно сужается и ветвится подобно надземной части
   дерева. Этот главный корень обычно дополняется придаточными, горизонтально
   расходящимися от основания ствола. В случае мочковатой корневой системы,
   характерной, например, для ильмов, буков и кленов, у дерева имеются только
   такие горизонтальные корни, а главный среди них не заметен. Внутри каждого
   из этих типов наблюдаются многочисленные варианты. Кроме того, деревья
   одного и того же вида могут образовывать стержневую корневую систему на
   мощных плодородных почвах и мочковатую – на сырых или каменистых местах.

Система стебля.

   Эта система у дерева включает главный стебель, или ствол, и ветви,
   образующие в типичном случае крону, т.е. обширное, более или менее густое
   сплетение ветвей различного порядка, несущих листья, а также цветки или
   шишки.

   Стебель состоит из различных тканей: центр его занимает т.н. сердцевина, а
   вокруг нее располагаются концентрическими слоями древесина, камбий и кора.
   Молодой стебель образуется из верхушечной (первичной) меристемы – массы
   делящихся клеток на конце побега, обеспечивающих его рост в длину. После
   деления нижние из дочерних клеток дифференцируются в различные ткани, а
   верхние продолжают делиться. Следовательно, удлинение стебля идет только
   путем его верхушечного роста.

   СТРОЕНИЕ СТЕБЛЯ. а – Поперечный срез трехлетней ветки тюльпанного дерева,
   имеющей типичное для древесного стебля строение. Сердцевина окружена тремя
   слоями (годичными кольцами) древесины, камбием и корой, состоящей из
   флоэмы, первичной коры и пробки.б – Фрагмент среза, приведенного на рис.
   а, при большем увеличении; показан участок между двумя сердцевинными
   лучами. Можно видеть последнее годичное кольцо и группу клеток флоэмы.в – 
   Радиальный продольный срез древесины и флоэмы фрагмента, показанного на
   рис. б. Можно видеть похожие на лестницу торцевые стенки члеников сосудов
   и мелкие эллиптические поры в их боковых стенках. У члеников ситовидных
   трубок поры на торцевых стенках образуют т.н. ситовидные пластинки.

Сердцевина.

   Этот пронизывающий весь стебель центральный «стержень» представляет собой
   относительно мягкую ткань из довольно крупных, тонкостенных, слабо
   специализированных клеток, служащих для временного накопления питательных
   веществ. Поперечный срез сердцевины может быть круглым (ильм, ясень),
   треугольным (ольха) или пятиугольным – звездчатым (тополь, дуб). Обычно
   сердцевина отличается по цвету от окружающей древесины. На продольном
   срезе она бывает сплошной (однородной), перегородчатой (с поперечными
   уплотнениями, относительно регулярно распределенными в более мягкой массе
   клеток) или пористой (разделенной поперечными перегородками на камеры).
   Сердцевина образуется из верхушечной меристемы и ко вторичному утолщению
   не способна. У большинства деревьев ее клетки через несколько лет
   отмирают, однако их стенки могут сохраняться без изменений десятилетиями.

Камбий.

   Между древесиной и корой находится слой боковой меристемы – камбия –
   толщиной в одну клетку. Его клетки длинные, параллельные оси побега и
   прямоугольные в поперечном сечении. Они продольно делятся, образуя новые
   стенки параллельно поверхности стебля. Из двух дочерних клеток одна
   остается меристематической (способной к дальнейшему делению), а вторая
   дифференцируется: если она лежит кнаружи от камбия, то превращается в
   элемент флоэмы (луба), если с противоположной стороны – в клетку ксилемы
   (древесины). Таким образом происходит утолщение стебля, т.е. увеличение
   его диаметра. Поскольку этот рост отстает от удлинения и обеспечивается не
   первичной (верхушечной) меристемой, а камбием, он называется вторичным.

   Большинство делений клеток камбия приводит к формированию новых элементов
   древесины. По мере увеличения ее объема меристематическое кольцо не
   разрывается, поскольку некоторые клеточные деления в нем происходят по
   радиальным плоскостям; однако кора растягивается и в конечном итоге
   трескается (характер этого растрескивания часто относится к видовым
   признакам дерева).

Кольца прироста.

   Поскольку утолщение древесины целиком зависит от активности камбия, этот
   прирост идет концентрическими кольцами, причем в районах с сезонными
   колебаниями погодных условий – только в определенные времена года. У
   большинства видов клетки, образующиеся в начале и конце вегетационного
   периода, различаются по форме и размерам, поэтому на поперечном срезе
   стебля можно видеть чередующиеся слои ранней и поздней древесины – кольца
   прироста. Чаще всего они бывают годичными, но это не всегда так. Например,
   в крайне суровых местообитаниях новая древесина в исключительно холодные
   или засушливые годы вообще не образуется. И наоборот – деревья, пережившие
   в течение вегетационного периода непродолжительный стресс (отмирание
   листьев из-за поздних заморозков, объедание листьев гусеницами, короткую
   засуху), дают в год два кольца прироста, а иногда и больше. Во влажных
   тропиках камбий функционирует более или менее равномерно, поэтому четких
   колец на срезе ствола не видно.

   В областях с умеренным климатом клетки ранней (весенней) древесины
   относительно тонкостенные с широким просветом, а поздней (летней) – с
   более узким просветом и толстыми стенками. Между этими двумя типами может
   быть резкая разница или плавный переход в зависимости главным образом от
   породы дерева, хотя определенную роль играют также условия вегетационного
   периода. У кленов, тюльпанного и амбрового деревьев и ряда других пород
   весенняя древесина мало отличается от летней, и годичные кольца выражены
   слабо. У дубов, ясеней, сосен ладанной и голой эта разница, наоборот,
   очень резкая и годичные кольца обычно нетрудно подсчитать. Летняя
   древесина таких видов плотнее и прочнее, чем весенняя, она медленнее гниет
   и поэтому на поверхности их старых пней часто образует выступающие
   концентрические гребни.

   ДАТИРОВКА ДРЕВЕСИНЫ. На рисунке показано, как годичные кольца используются
   для установления возраста древесины. Этот метод основан на детальном
   сопоставлении, или перекрестной датировке, последовательностей широких и
   узких колец. Дерево в спилено в 1968. Следовательно, его последнее
   годичное кольцо (образец вў) сформировалось тогда же. Считая от него
   внутрь, можно определить возраст любого кольца этой древесины. Затем ее
   сравнивают с образцом бў, полученным из ствола, спиленного раньше, и
   выявляют идентичный по характеру чередования узких и широких колец
   интервал, например соответствующий периоду 1925–1932 точно датированной
   древесины. Теперь, ведя подсчет в обе стороны от него, можно определить
   год образования прочих колец дерева б. Аналогичным образом, путем
   сравнения с образцом бў, датируют все кольца еще более старого ствола а.
   Пользуясь этим методом, ученые устанавливают возраст не только пней, но и
   брусьев, досок и других деревянных изделий, обнаруживаемых при
   археологических раскопках. Кроме того, поскольку ширина кольца прироста
   зависит от количества осадков и других климатических факторов
   соответствующего года, на этой основе можно реконструировать климатическую
   историю конкретной местности.

Ксилема.

   Клетки древесины, или ксилемы, делятся на несколько типов. Один из них –
   длинные (длина часто в сто и более раз превышает ширину), веретеновидные
   (заостренные на концах) клетки, т.н. трахеиды. У лиственных пород их длина
   составляет в среднем 6 мм, у хвойных – 2–8 мм, однако их размер сильно
   варьирует в пределах одного вида и даже одного экземпляра дерева. У зрелых
   трахеид протопласт (живое содержимое) отмирает, и от клетки остаются
   только твердые стенки и центральная полость (просвет). Эти мертвые
   элементы придают прочность стеблю, а более молодые слои проводят вверх по
   нему воду с растворенными в ней минеральными веществами. Из одной трахеиды
   в другую раствор поступает через круглые поры – места истончения клеточной
   оболочки. Другой тип клеток ксилемы – клетки волокон, сходные с
   трахеидами, но стенка их намного толще и без пор, а просвет уже. Они в
   основном придают стеблю прочность.

   Клетки, называемые члениками сосудов, присутствуют только в древесине
   покрытосеменных. Как и трахеиды, они в зрелом состоянии мертвые, но по
   диаметру больше, относительно тонкостенные и на концах перфорированные,
   т.е. открытые. Сотни таких члеников часто соединяются торцами, образуя
   непрерывные трубки – многометровые сосуды. Если просвет ранних (весенних)
   сосудов значительно больше, чем поздних (летних), то древесина называется
   кольцепоровой, а если эти просветы примерно равны – рассеяннопоровой.
   Первая наблюдается, например, у дуба белого, а вторая – у березы желтой.
   По сосудам вода с растворенными в ней веществами перемещается вверх
   быстрее, чем по трахеидам.

   Клетки паренхимы древесины в отличие от трахеид, члеников сосудов и
   волокон в зрелом состоянии живые, невытянутые, относительно тонкостенные,
   но, как правило, с порами. Они участвуют в транспорте и запасании
   питательных веществ. Из живых клеток состоят узкие тяжи – т.н.
   сердцевинные лучи, радиально пронизывающие ксилему. У хвойных пород эти
   лучи толщиной только в одну клетку, а у лиственных – в одну, две и более.
   По ним осуществляется радиальный транспорт. У всех лиственных и некоторых
   хвойных деревьев в древесине присутствуют и осевые паренхимные тяжи –
   осевая паренхима. У многих хвойных в ксилеме также проходят смоляные ходы
   – непрерывные трубки, возникающие при расхождении секреторных клеток,
   становящихся их стенками. Эти клетки выделяют смолу, которая быстро
   запечатывает раны на дереве, обездвиживает и убивает повреждающих
   древесину насекомых и, возможно, выполняет другие защитные функции.

   Живые клетки, участвующие в транспорте и накоплении питательных веществ,
   находятся только в самых молодых слоях древесины, расположенных ближе
   всего к камбию. В стволе и крупных ветвях эта ее часть называется
   заболонью. У каштана и белой акации заболонь состоит всего из нескольких
   годичных колец и достигает в толщину не более 13 мм, однако у кленов,
   ясеней, карий и некоторых сосен она бывает толщиной до 15 см.

   По мере старения древесины у большинства видов паренхимные клетки
   прорастают сквозь поры сосудов и трахеид, образуя в них пробки, или тиллы,
   которые препятствуют движению воды. С годами здесь также накапливаются
   камеди, смолы, минеральные соли, танины и другие вещества. У большинства
   видов они окрашивают внутреннюю – ядровую – древесину в темный цвет и
   повышают ее устойчивость к гниению. Такой устойчивостью славятся,
   например, болотный кипарис, можжевельник виргинский и белая акация, из
   которых получаются высококачественные сваи и столбы. Кроме того, ядровая
   древесина можжевельника содержит вещества, отпугивающие насекомых, и
   некоторые его виды широко используются для изготовления комодов и шкафов,
   в которых не заводится моль. У большинства елей, пихт, тсуг, тополей,
   конских каштанов и лип ядровая древесина почти не отличается по цвету от
   заболони.

Флоэма.

   Вторая образуемая камбием проводящая ткань – флоэма, или луб, которую
   называют также внутренней корой. Она состоит главным образом из ситовидных
   трубок, по которым растворенные питательные вещества движутся по стеблю
   вниз. Клетки (членики) ситовидных трубок удлиненные и тонкостенные. Их
   стенки выстилает слой живой протоплазмы, окружающий крупную центральную
   вакуоль. На концах стенки перфорированы или отсутствуют, и в этих местах
   протопласты члеников ситовидных трубок соединяются друг с другом. Сотни
   таких члеников, смыкаясь торцами, образуют непрерывные тяжи – ситовидные
   трубки, тянущиеся от концов корней до листьев. У лиственных пород к
   ситовидным трубкам примыкают клетки-спутники; протопласты двух этих
   элементов связаны друг с другом через поры в боковых стенках. Считается,
   что клетки-спутники каким-то образом способствуют транспорту веществ по
   флоэме. Кроме того, во флоэме находятся волокна, придающие ткани
   прочность, и паренхима, в которой накапливаются питательные вещества. Если
   окольцевать дерево, т.е. надрезать его кору по кругу до самой древесины,
   нисходящий флоэмный транспорт органических веществ прекратится, корни
   начнут голодать и растение вскоре погибнет.

Кора.

   Когда клетки флоэмы отмирают, они сплющиваются нарастающей в толщину
   древесиной и входят в состав защитной наружной коры. Однако последняя
   утолщается в основном за счет третьего типа меристемы – пробкового камбия,
   или феллогена. Он формируется внутри живой флоэмы либо сплошным
   цилиндрическим слоем, либо – у большинства деревьев – отдельными
   участками. В ходе делений феллогена снаружи от него откладываются слои
   мертвой водонепроницаемой пробки, а в противоположную сторону – живая
   ткань, называемая феллодермой. Неравномерное образование пробки в
   сочетании с особенностями растрескивания коры по мере ее растяжения
   приводит к сложному и разнообразному рельефу поверхности ствола и старых
   ветвей.

   Кора с возрастом дерева утолщается, а ее наружные слои непрерывно
   отслаиваются. В результате пробковый камбий рано или поздно оказывается
   вблизи поверхности и отмирает, а на смену ему во внутренней коре
   закладывается новый. Иногда на различной глубине в коре одновременно
   функционируют два или несколько его слоев. Поскольку наружная кора
   постоянно отслаивается, а нарастает с помощью пробкового камбия
   относительно медленно, по массе и объему она составляет лишь небольшую
   часть ствола дерева. В стволах большинства деревьев ее толщина редко
   превышает 5 см, хотя у основания секвой и секвойядендронов она может
   достигать и 60 см.

   Чечевички – это отверстия в коре, через которые происходит газообмен
   тканей стебля с атмосферой. Через них внутрь поступает необходимый для
   клеточного дыхания кислород, а наружу выделяется образующийся в ходе этого
   процесса углекислый газ. На молодых участках стебля чечевички выглядят
   округлыми или удлиненными бугорками и обычно развиваются там, где в
   эпидермисе находились устьица. У большинства видов они по мере старения и
   утолщения коры закупориваются и отваливаются вместе с ее наружными слоями,
   но у некоторых деревьев, например вишен, остаются заметными в течение
   многих лет.

   Рассмотренное выше концентрическое расположение тканей стебля характерно
   для хвойных пород и для двудольных покрытосеменных. У однодольных
   покрытосеменных, например у пальм, юкк и бамбуков, картина иная. Клетки
   древесины и флоэмы у них собраны в продольные тяжи – т.н. сосудистые
   пучки, разбросанные в толще стебля и окруженные основной паренхимой,
   сходной с той, что образует сердцевину двудольных. Утолщение стебля
   происходит за счет медленно функционирующей боковой меристемы,
   развивающейся у юкк и пальм из клеток основной паренхимы. Стволы
   однодольных деревьев утолщаются слабо и от основания к вершине почти не
   сужаются.

Листья.

   У листопадных пород каждый лист живет всего несколько месяцев, а у
   вечнозеленых – не более 14 лет. Главная его функция – фотосинтез, т.е.
   образование питательных веществ из диоксида углерода и воды. Этот процесс
   требует солнечного света, поэтому строение кроны дерева призвано
   обеспечить его эффективное улавливание. Например, у сахарного клена
   среднего размера на открытом месте проекция кроны на землю занимает
   примерно 0,004 га, а общая площадь поверхности листвы может достигать 0,12
   га, т.е. бывает в 30 раз больше. Обычно на каждый гектар леса приходится
   3–5 га освещаемой солнцем листовой поверхности. См. также ЛИСТ;
   ФОТОСИНТЕЗ.

Репродуктивные структуры.

   Все современные деревья, за исключением древовидных папоротников,
   размножаются семенами, которые образуются в цветках или шишках. Цветки
   сходны с шишками не только по функции, но и по основному строению. И те и
   другие формируются обычно из первичной меристемы стебля и образуют пыльцу
   и семяпочки, в которых развиваются соответственно спермии и яйцеклетки,
   т.е. мужские и женские половые клетки. После оплодотворения яйцеклетки
   спермием она дает начало семени с зародышем растения внутри. Основное
   различие между шишками и цветками заключается в том, что семена у первых
   «голые», т.е. не защищены снаружи дополнительными структурами, а у вторых
   созревают внутри завязи.

Шишки.

   Растения, образующие шишки, по указанной выше причине называются
   голосеменными. Их семяпочки находятся на поверхности специализированных
   листьев – мегаспорофиллов. У древних голосеменных, т.н. семенных
   папоротников, известных только по ископаемым остаткам, мегаспорофиллы
   практически не отличались от прочих листьев. У современных же
   представителей этой группы и они, и образующие пыльцу микроспорофиллы
   мелкие, видоизменены в чешуи и в большинстве случаев собраны плотными
   спиралями на укороченных побегах – шишках, или стробилах. Семяпочки
   развиваются на поверхности семенных чешуй в женских шишках, а пыльца – в
   особых мужских шишках, которые мельче женских и не столь сильно
   одревесневают. Самые крупные женские шишки – у сосны Ламберта, их длина
   достигает 58 см; самые мелкие – у некоторых можжевельников – диаметром ок.
   0,3 см. В большинстве случаев мужские и женские шишки растут на одном и
   том же дереве. См. также СИСТЕМАТИКА РАСТЕНИЙ.

Цветки.

   У цветковых, или покрытосеменных, растений мегаспорофиллы называются
   плодолистиками. Один или несколько сросшихся плодолистиков образуют
   замкнутую полую структуру, называемую пестиком, в нижней части которой –
   завязи – находятся семяпочки. Там же они созревают в семена. Пестики и
   образующие пыльцу тычинки могут находиться в одном цветке, как у
   тюльпанного дерева, кленов и вишен, в разных цветках на одном дереве, как
   у дубов, карий и берез (однодомные виды), или же могут вообще
   формироваться на разных – женских и мужских – деревьях, как у ив и тополей
   (двудомные виды).

   В состав цветка кроме тычинок и пестиков могут входить вспомогательные
   структуры, обычно чашелистики и лепестки. Различия формы и расположения
   частей цветка дают практически неисчерпаемое богатство вариантов строения
   и являются основными признаками, используемыми для классификации
   покрытосеменных растений. Разнообразия прибавляют и особенности
   образования цветков на дереве – поодиночке или плотными группами, т.е.
   соцветиями. Так, магнолии ценятся озеленителями за очень крупные одиночные
   цветки, часто с ярко окрашенными лепестками. У кельрейтерии метельчатой,
   белой акации и оксидендрума древовидного мелкие цветки собраны в
   живописные кисти. Цветкам шелковой акации придают особую красоту их
   длинные ярко окрашенные тычинки. В то же время цветки многих деревьев,
   особенно ветроопыляемых, настолько невзрачны, что большинство людей их
   вообще не замечает. К таким видам относятся, например, дубы, ясени,
   грецкие орехи, ильмы.

Плоды.

   У деревьев, принадлежащих к покрытосеменным, как и у прочих растений этой
   группы, плод представляет собой зрелую завязь с семенами, иногда
   срастающуюся с другими структурами. Называть плодами женские шишки
   голосеменных с точки зрения ботаники неверно.

   По форме, строению и размерам плоды весьма разнообразны. Самый крупный
   плод у сейшельской пальмы; он напоминает двулопастной кокосовый орех,
   весит до 18 кг и содержит, вероятно, самое большое в мире семя.

   У одних деревьев плоды сухие и твердые, у других – мягкие и сочные. У
   ильмов, ясеней и айланта плоды называются крылатками. Они сухие, одно- или
   двусемянные и снабжены крыловидным выростом. У кленов плоды примерно такие
   же, но обычно с двумя крылышками; они называются двукрылатками. У
   тюльпанного дерева 80–100 крылаток, перед тем как разлететься, сидят тесно
   прижатыми друг к другу на центральной оси, что в целом внешне весьма
   напоминает шишку.

   К другим сухим плодам относятся орехи, бобы и коробочки. У орехов стенка
   завязи, созревая, одревесневает и превращается в твердую скорлупу.
   Некоторые орехи на дереве частично или полностью окружены как бы чехлом из
   видоизмененных листьев или разросшихся тканей стебля – плюской (например,
   у лещины, дуба), которая бывает колючей, как у каштана или бука. Бобы при
   созревании вскрываются по шву. Этот тип плода свойствен, например, акации,
   иудиному дереву и рожковому дереву. У конских каштанов плоды, вопреки
   распространенному мнению, не орехи, а коробочки, внутри которых находятся
   похожие на орехи семена. Коробочка – также вскрывающийся плод. Среди
   известных деревьев он свойствен, например, тополям и ивам.

   К мясистым относятся такие типы плода, как яблоко (яблоня, груша, рябина и
   т.д.) и ягода (финиковая пальма, хурма и т.д.). Плоды цитрусовых –
   гесперидии, или померанцы, – представляют собой модифицированную ягоду с
   кожистой оболочкой, содержащей множество эфирномасличных желез, и сочными
   волосками внутри. Костянка, свойственная вишне, сливе, персику, оливе и
   т.д., – это обычно сочный плод, внутренняя часть которого превращена в
   деревянистую косточку, окружающую семя. Впрочем, костянки бывают и сухими,
   например у миндаля, грецкого ореха и кокосовой пальмы: их плоды перед
   продажей принято очищать от наружных покровов, оставляя только косточку,
   поэтому в просторечии они называются орехами, что с точки зрения ботаники
   неправильно. Кокосовое молоко – это не до конца созревший (достигший
   молочной спелости) эндосперм семени, в котором сосредоточены его
   питательные вещества.

   В некоторых случаях несколько завязей одного цветка, созревая, не
   разделяются, а образуют т.н. сборный плод, например у магнолий.
   Совокупность зрелых плодов одного соцветия называют соплодием. Соплодия
   характерны, например, для шелковиц (тутовников), маклюр и хлебного дерева.

Семена.

   Семена у деревьев, как и у прочих семенных растений, распространяются
   ветром, животными, водой. Распространение может облегчаться структурными
   приспособлениями самих семян или плодов. У кленов, ильмов, тюльпанного
   дерева, берез, ясеней, катальпы и многих хвойных летучесть семян
   увеличивают крыловидные выросты, а у ив и тополей – пучки волосков.
   Кокосовые «орехи» и плоды клекачек могут проплывать большие расстояния.

   Мясистые плоды с высокой питательной ценностью привлекают животных,
   которые растаскивают их во все стороны от материнских растений, а иногда и
   закапывают про запас. При этом неизбежные «потери при транспортировке и
   хранении» дают начало всходам. Семена многих съеденных плодов проходят
   через пищеварительный тракт животных неповрежденными и в результате
   попадают в почву вместе с порцией удобрений.

РАЗМНОЖЕНИЕ ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   Обычно деревья размножаются семенами, но в ряде случаев предпочтительным
   оказывается вегетативное размножение, например черенками, отводками и
   прививками. Этот способ позволяет воспроизводить бессемянные деревья (в
   частности, пупочные апельсины) и гибриды, не способные размножаться
   половым путем, а также получать большое количество экземпляров тех форм,
   которые образуют мало жизнеспособных семян. При вегетативном размножении
   взрослые плодоносящие деревья можно получать быстрее, чем из всходов.
   Прививка дает возможность сочетать неприхотливость корневых систем одних
   деревьев с ценными качествами плодов других сортов и даже видов, что
   позволяет получать урожай в более суровых условиях, а также бороться с
   преследующими данную культуру корневыми вредителями и паразитами.
   Например, слива, привитая на персик, хорошо плодоносит на песчаных почвах,
   где она сама по себе скорее всего погибла бы, а европейский виноград,
   привитый на американскую лозу, растет лучше, поскольку последняя устойчива
   к повреждающей корни европейской филлоксере.

Черенкование.

   Черенки – это отрезки побегов, нижний конец которых помещают во влажную
   почву или воду для укоренения. У ив, тополя пирамидального, белой акации,
   кизила, ликвидамбара, тюльпанного дерева, гинкго, кедра и многих других
   деревьев придаточные корни образуются очень легко и черенки быстро
   превращаются в растения, способные существовать самостоятельно. В других
   случаях корнеобразование стимулируют с помощью растительных гормонов
   (фитогормонов), в частности индолилуксусной, индолилпропионовой,
   индолилмасляной и нафтилуксусной кислот. Свежие черенки, еще не
   образовавшие корней, очень чувствительны к высыханию, поэтому для снижения
   потерь воды у них удаляют часть листьев и применяют защитные покрытия или
   опрыскивание водным аэрозолем.

Размножение отводками

   сходно с черенкованием, но дочерний стебель не отделяют от материнского до
   укоренения, а обычно сначала пригибают к земле, пришпиливают и окучивают.
   В узлах такого отводка развиваются придаточные корни и вертикальные
   побеги, способные к самостоятельному существованию. Таким способом
   размножают, например, магнолии и кизил, а естественное образование
   отводков наблюдается у елей, пихт, туй, тсуг, сосны обыкновенной и многих
   других хвойных.

Прививка (трансплантация).

   При этом способе свежесрезанный черенок (привой) прижимают местом среза к
   надрезу на укорененном растении (подвое) и прочно закрепляют в таком
   положении. Их ткани срастаются, и вся система начинает функционировать как
   единое целое. Привой обычно получают от таксона с ценными цветками,
   плодами или другими надземными органами, а подвоем служит близкий таксон,
   у которого они менее ценные, но корневая система устойчивее или мощнее.
   Как правило, прививки используют для рутинного размножения плодовых или
   декоративных деревьев, но иногда и специально для получения ботанических
   курьезов – экземпляров, на ветвях которых можно наблюдать более 100
   различных типов листвы, цветков и плодов.

   Чтобы обеспечить успех прививки, следует соблюдать ряд условий. Привой
   должен только начинать выходить из состояния покоя, т.е. лучшее время для
   этой операции – весна. Чтобы защитить место соединения привоя с подвоем от
   высыхания и болезнетворных организмов, его обмазывают садовым варом.
   Необходимо также привести в соприкосновение камбиальные слои привоя и
   подвоя. Эти слои непосредственно не срастаются. Сначала на двух стеблях
   образуется раневая ткань, или каллус, которая затем дифференцируется на
   клетки ксилемы, флоэмы и наружной коры, образующие мостик между
   соответствующими тканями привоя и подвоя.

   Наиболее распространенные способы прививки – в расщеп и почкой, или
   глазком (окулировка). В первом случае обычно два клинообразно заостренных
   тонких привоя вставляют в щель, вырезанную в пеньке толстого подвоя так,
   чтобы они соприкасались с его камбиальной зоной. При окулировке привой
   состоит из почки с окружающим ее кусочком коры. В коре подвоя делают
   T-образный надрез, в него вставляют привой, плотно приматывают и
   замазывают садовым варом. Прививку глазком лучше всего проводить в конце
   лета или начале осени – непосредственно перед тем, как кора подвоя
   отвердеет на зиму. Этот метод, наиболее распространенный при размножении
   вишен, персиков и слив, позволяет получить от одного стебля сразу много
   привоев.

   Еще один способ прививки – аблактировка, или прививка сближением. Побеги
   двух растущих рядом деревьев надрезают, соединяют местами срезов,
   обвязывают и обмазывают. Когда они срастутся, привой отделяют от его
   корня, а подвой обрезают выше места прививки. Кстати говоря, похожее
   срастание ветвей наблюдается у деревьев и в природе.

   ПРИВИВКА В РАСЩЕП. Обычно используются два привоя, диаметр которых
   значительно меньше, чем у подвоя. Один конец у них заостряют плоским
   клином и вставляют в щель, сделанную на пеньке подвоя, ближе к двум ее
   краям – там, где находится камбиальная зона. Затем открытые места срезов
   обмазывают садовым варом, чтобы защитить живые ткани от
   инфекции.ОКУЛИРОВКА. При окулировке, или прививке глазком, привой состоит
   из «щитка», т.е.почки («глазка») с узкой полоской окружающей ее наружной
   коры и живой флоэмы. Подвой – толстую ветку – надрезают T-образно, и в эту
   щель вставляют привой. Затем его прижимают снаружи корой подвоя,
   обматывают место прививки лентой или мягкой веревкой и замазывают садовым
   варом.

ВРЕДИТЕЛИ И БОЛЕЗНИ ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   Различными тканями дерева питаются многие членистоногие. Некоторые из них
   портят внешний вид дерева, не причиняя ему существенного вреда, другие же
   могут нанести ему серьезный ущерб и даже погубить. Можно выделить две
   основные группы таких организмов. Первичные вредители нападают на здоровые
   деревья, а вторичные – на ослабленные или погибающие. Можно также выделить
   два главных класса болезней деревьев – паразитарные, т.е. вызываемые
   живыми организмами, и непаразитарные, возникающие из-за неблагоприятных
   физико-химических (абиотических) факторов среды.

Первичные вредители.

   Многие виды жуков и бабочек поражают стволы здоровых деревьев. Обычно
   взрослая самка откладывает в трещины коры яйца, а из них вылупляются
   личинки, которые прогрызают в стволе дерева ходы и питаются сначала лубом
   и камбием, а позже могут проникать в заболонь и даже в ядровую древесину.
   Пример – дровосек белой акации. Взрослый жук – черный с зигзагообразными
   желтыми полосами – ест пыльцу золотарника и других трав, а его личинки
   прогрызают ходы в стволах деревьев.

   Листья дерева служат кормом взрослым жукам и их личинкам, гусеницам
   бабочек, личинкам пилильщиков, муравьям, тлям, отдельным видам почти всех
   прочих групп насекомых, а также клещам. Некоторые виды, например хрущик
   японский и гусеницы шелкопряда непарного, объедают листья снаружи; другие,
   в частности малый минирующий березовый пилильщик, прокладывают ходы в их
   мягких внутренних тканях. Тли, червецы, цикадки, хермесы и паутинные
   клещики сосут сок из листовых жилок.

   Среди наиболее интересных и наименее опасных насекомых, поражающих
   здоровые деревья, заслуживают упоминания галлообразователи. В основном это
   крошечные перепончатокрылые и двукрылые, хотя галлы, т.е. патологические
   разрастания растительных тканей, образуют также многие тли и некоторые
   клещи. Одни из самых крупных галлов – т.н. чернильные орешки на дубе.

   Некоторые насекомые служат переносчиками болезней деревьев. Например,
   заболонник струйчатый переносит споры гриба, вызывающего голландскую
   болезнь ильмовых, при которой нарушается водопроводящая функция ксилемы.
   Листья на зараженных ветвях вянут и отмирают, а в конечном итоге гибнет
   все дерево.

Вторичные вредители.

   Деревья, ослабленные механическим повреждением, пожаром, болезнью, плохим
   питанием, засухой и другими неблагоприятными факторами, особенно
   чувствительны к поражению насекомыми, поедающими их луб, камбий и
   древесину. Мелкие кучки или столбики белых пылевидных отходов («буровой
   муки»), выступающие из-под коры, – признак работы короедов. Эти жуки
   нападают только на умирающие деревья, поэтому бороться с ними обычно
   бессмысленно. Многие их виды проделывают в коре ходы диаметром с дробинку.
   Они питаются лубом и камбием. Часто результатом их деятельности
   оказывается целая сложная сеть ходов, которую можно видеть, сняв
   пораженный участок коры с дерева. Если эти ходы опояшут ствол кольцом,
   лишив его тем самым на этом отрезке луба и камбия, то флоэмное питание
   корня прекратится, а ксилема в этом месте перестанет обновляться. В
   результате дерево погибнет или почти сразу из-за того, что нарушится
   водоснабжение кроны, или медленнее из-за прекращения притока питательных
   веществ от листьев к корням.

Меры борьбы с вредителями.

   Лучшая мера защиты от вредителей – поддержание здорового состояния
   деревьев. Повреждений следует избегать или быстро устранять их, при
   подозрении на недостаток питательных веществ вносить в почву удобрения, в
   сухие периоды производить полив. Однако в некоторых случаях таких мер
   оказывается недостаточно.

   В последние десятилетия появилось множество химических инсектицидов,
   которые могут предупреждать нападение вредителей и убивать их. Однако эти
   вещества действуют и на полезных насекомых, а во многих случаях также на
   птиц, млекопитающих и самого человека, поэтому применять их надо с большой
   осторожностью, точно следуя инструкциям. Умирающие деревья, пораженные
   короедами, необходимо вырубать и сжигать или обрабатывать специальными
   препаратами, например ортодихлорбензолом в смеси 1:6 с мазутом. Если не
   уничтожить короедов, они могут настолько размножиться, что пострадают и
   растущие рядом здоровые деревья.

Непаразитарные болезни.

   Эти заболевания – неинфекционные, т.е. незаразные, хотя многие деревья
   страдают от одних и тех же абиотических факторов. Дефицит влаги,
   недостаток кислорода для корней, солнечные ожоги, промерзание и
   обморожения, избыток соли, несбалансированное питание и отравление
   загрязняющими веществами – все это неблагоприятно сказывается на состоянии
   деревьев и может привести к их гибели.

Паразитарные болезни.

   Основными болезнетворными агентами, или патогенами, поражающими деревья,
   являются грибы, хотя большой вред им наносят также вирусы и бактерии.
   Обитающие в почве крошечные черви нематоды, проникающие в корни деревьев,
   особенно опасны для плодовых культур. На деревьях поселяются и
   паразитические семенные растения, например омела, однако вред от них
   обычно невелик. Поскольку паразиты могут распространяться от больного
   дерева к здоровому, вызываемые ими болезни называют инфекционными, т.е.
   заразными.

Грибы.

   Грибы не способны к фотосинтезу, поэтому питаются органическими остатками
   (сапрофиты) или паразитируют на живых организмах. Хотя большинство грибов
   для деревьев безвредны, а многие даже полезны, тысячи видов становятся
   причиной болезней (микозов) разной тяжести, в том числе и таких, которые
   заканчиваются гибелью дерева. Эти патогены могут поражать практически
   любую часть дерева, вызывая, например, завядание кроны, пятнистость
   листьев, рак стебля, гниль древесины и гниль плодов, галлообразование и
   корневые гнили. Если поражаются листья или цветки, то дерево может просто
   ослабнуть или дать плохой урожай, но сильное поражение камбия, флоэмы,
   древесины или корней чревато гибелью всего растения.

Вирусы

   отличаются крайне высокой инфекционностью и передаются от одного растения
   к другому большей частью с помощью насекомых-переносчиков.

   Известно не так много вирусных болезней (вирозов) деревьев, однако не
   исключено, что именно вирусы – причина различных их аномалий, этиология
   которых еще не выяснена. Самое опасное вирусное заболевание деревьев в
   Северной Америке – некроз флоэмы ильмовых. Луб пораженных ильмов
   (американского и крылаточерешкового) становится желтовато-бурым, листья
   внезапно желтеют и вянут. Гибель дерева может наступить уже через
   несколько недель после появления первых симптомов болезни или же через
   год–два и более. Переносят эту болезнь мелкие цикадки.

Бактерии

   встречаются практически в любой среде. Многие из них – сапрофиты, полезные
   тем, что разлагают мертвые листья, ветви, плоды и другие органические
   остатки, но известны и некоторые бактериальные болезни (бактериозы)
   деревьев. В качестве примера можно привести бактериальный ожог плодовых
   деревьев, поражающий груши, яблони и близкие к ним культуры, а также
   бактериальный некроз древовидного кактуса карнегии гигантской (сагуаро).

ПОСАДКА ДЕРЕВЬЕВ

   При выборе деревьев для посадки нужно принимать во внимание особенности
   породы и места, где деревьям предстоит расти, т.е. климат, рельеф, почву и
   т.п. Желательно опираться на два источника информации – природную
   древесную флору (дендрофлору) данной области и, особенно в случае
   экзотических таксонов, карты зон адаптации растений, определяющие области,
   где температуры позволяют выращивать те или иные виды. Влажность и
   почвенные условия при этом не учитываются, т.к. их можно изменить
   искусственно – путем осушения, орошения, удобрения и т.п. Впрочем,
   региональные температурные ограничения также до определенной степени
   преодолимы, например путем посадки теплолюбивых видов на хорошо
   прогреваемых южных склонах или укрывания на зиму чувствительных к холоду
   экземпляров.

   Важно правильно выбрать время посадки. В любом случае желательно
   производить ее тогда, когда саженцы находятся в состоянии покоя. В
   северных областях это лучше делать весной, чтобы дерево успело окрепнуть
   до зимних холодов, в более теплых районах – весной или осенью.

   При пересадке от 20 до 80% корневой системы дерева теряется, в том числе

   основная масса молодых активных корней, поэтому способность растения
   всасывать из почвы воду с минеральными солями сильно снижается. Чтобы
   компенсировать эту потерю, широколиственные саженцы рекомендуется
   обрезать, пропорционально уменьшая поверхность испаряющих влагу стеблей и
   листьев. Надземные части хвойных пород лучше сохраняют влагу, поэтому в
   обрезке, как правило, не нуждаются.

   При посадке желательно, чтобы корни саженца не деформировались. Если грунт
   слишком плотный или, наоборот, чересчур рыхлый, следует выкопать лунку
   вдвое шире и глубже, чем корневая система, и заполнить ее более подходящим
   субстратом. Засыпая лунку вокруг дерева, надо уплотнять землю, пока до
   поверхности не останется 5–8 см, а после этого тщательно полить
   углубление, чтобы как следует увлажнить почву и обеспечить ее лучший
   контакт с корнями. Когда засыпка лунки окончена, земля вокруг ствола
   должна быть на 3–5 см выше исходного уровня: она будет постепенно оседать,
   заполняя оставшиеся между корнями пустоты.

   Высаженным в ветренных местах деревьям высотой более 2 м на первых порах
   нужна опора. Если диаметр их ствола меньше 5 см, достаточно одного
   колышка, поднимающегося на 60 см выше уровня самой нижней ветви. Если
   дерево толще, его привязывают к двум-трем кольям или укрепляют на
   трех-четырех проволочных растяжках.

ОЗЕЛЕНЕНИЕ ГОРОДОВ

   Деревья – один из важнейших элементов городского ландшафта. Зеленые
   насаждения выполняют эстетическую функцию, улучшают микроклимат,
   рассеивают слишком яркий свет, служат фильтром для пыли и других
   загрязнителей воздуха.

   К деревьям, используемым для озеленения городов, предъявляется ряд
   специфических требований. Они должны иметь не только эстетически
   выигрышную, но и достаточно прогнозируемую или легко контролируемую форму
   роста, расти быстрее, жить дольше, быть как можно более устойчивыми к
   болезням, вредителям, загрязнению и физическим повреждениям. Желательно,
   чтобы у листопадных деревьев цветки, плоды и осенняя окраска листьев были
   привлекательными. Весьма нежелательны плохой запах от каких-либо частей
   дерева, присутствие в них химических веществ, угнетающих рост других
   видов, а также корневая система, склонная взламывать снизу уличное
   покрытие и давать отпрыски вдалеке от материнского ствола. Следует также
   учитывать влияние искусственного освещения (особенно на т.н.
   короткодневные виды) и дополнительных источников тепла. Отмечено,
   например, что листья и цветки у деревьев в городе появляются раньше, чем у
   тех же видов в окружающей сельской местности.

   Выбор пород деревьев, высаживаемых в городах, естественно, зависит от
   конкретных географических условий. В пригородах и парках хорошо себя
   чувствуют многие виды местной дендрофлоры, в том числе вечнозеленые, но
   последние обычно плохо растут на оживленных улицах, поскольку их медленно
   обновляемая листва не приспособлена к высокому уровню атмосферного
   загрязнения. В то же время некоторые деревья особенно устойчивы к
   загрязнению, а также относительно мало страдают от болезней и вредителей,
   поэтому их охотнее всего используют для городского озеленения.

   Раньше широко практиковалось озеленение конкретной улицы единственной
   породой дерева, экземпляры которого располагались на более или менее
   одинаковых расстояниях друг от друга. С эстетической точки зрения это,
   может быть, и оправданно, однако такие одновидовые насаждения особенно
   чувствительны не только к вредителям и инфекционным болезням, но и к
   неблагоприятным погодным условиям, например засухе. Поэтому желательно
   использовать для озеленения даже небольших площадей несколько сочетающихся
   по форме и размеру древесных пород.

                                 Гимн деревьям

   22.04.2022

   Деревья защищают людей от непредсказуемых явлений природы, от мороза и
   зноя, от наводнений и засухи. Не будь деревьев, род людской не смог бы
   выжить: у нас не было бы инструментов, домов, заборов, мостов, книг и
   многого другого. В своей книге «Деревья» немецкий натуралист Андреас Хазе
   рассказывает о самых важных для человеческой истории и культуры видах
   деревьев, о применении древесины и других даров деревьев в хозяйственной
   деятельности человека, об этимологии некоторых названий, а также о
   верованиях, связанных с деревьями. Какие деревья могут прожить 1000 лет?
   Из какой древесины сделать флейту, чтобы она звучала мягко и нежно? Какие
   деревья помогали лекарям, птицеловам, рыбакам, художникам и даже самому
   Иоганну Гутенбергу? Читайте самые интересные факты из книги «Деревья» в
   нашем материале. 

Сосны могут жить 1000 лет и заселить Землю после пожара

   Сосна наряду с пихтой принадлежит к самым высоким деревьям Европы. Ствол
   диаметром более метра — в случае сосны не редкость. Иголки ее хвои длиной
   до 8 сантиметров синевато-зеленые, гибкие, но на удивление острые. Они
   остаются на ветке от 2 до 4 лет, регулярно обновляясь.

   Сосна развила глубокий и крепкий стержневой корень, с помощью которого
   может укрепиться в земле более прочно, чем другие деревья. Он проникает в
   глубину земли до 8 метров, а боковые корни могут простираться на
   расстояние до 16 метров. Ветровал редок, при условии, что сосны растут на
   подходящей почве и для них достаточно места. В Германии часто сажают
   сосны, не соблюдая этих условий, в местностях, где дерево никогда не стало
   бы расти само.

   По упомянутым причинам указываемый в специальной литературе максимальный
   возраст, который может достигать сосна в наших широтах, составляет
   преимущественно от 200 до 300 лет. В действительности же здоровая,
   выросшая в естественных условиях сосна способна доживать до 1000 лет.

   Именно сосновые леса сильнее всего подвержены угрозе пожаров: за счет
   высокого содержания смолы в дереве пламя с легкостью распространяется по
   кронам. От удара молнии или самовоспламенения в естественном лесу снова и
   снова случаются пожары, но, поскольку деревья в них растут на достаточно
   безопасном расстоянии друг от друга, такие возгорания не причиняют
   большого вреда лесонасаждению и даже жизненно необходимы для возобновления
   леса. Только в созданных человеком лесах хозяйственного назначения, где у
   плотно посаженных деревьев нет возможности спастись, свирепствуют
   действительно опустошающие лесные пожары.

   Удивительно, но семенные шишки некоторых видов сосны в США раскрываются
   только в огне, при температуре около 100 °C. Такие сосны смогут заселить
   землю после пожара.

Из бузины делали лекарства и красители

   Бузина — одно из самых полезных лекарственных растений, это объясняет,
   почему у германцев и кельтов с древних времен было к ней особое отношение.
   Каждая отдельная часть этого растения может использоваться в лечебных
   целях. Ни одно другое дерево или кустарник так эффективно не избавляли от
   боли. Считалось, например, что если бузинной щепкой уколоть десну до
   крови, то она вберет в себя всю зубную боль. Существовали методы лечения
   фурункулов и нарывов. В наши дни в натуропатии широко применяются отвары
   из цветков бузины и ванны с настоем из высушенных цветков.

   В немецком названии бузины — Holunder — прослеживается связь с именем
   древнегерманской богини брака и деторождения Гольды, которая
   покровительствовала земледелию и домоводству, прежде всего ткачеству.
   Издавна бузину использовали для окрашивания тканей, а также волос и кожи.
   Большим спросом пользуется красящая способность листьев. Добавление уксуса
   в отвар листьев, подвергшихся долгому кипячению, обеспечивает отбеливание
   текстиля. Кожица ягоды бузины, в свою очередь, содержит до 60 %
   натурального темно-фиолетового красителя — самбуцианина. Кора бузины также
   ценилась как красящее вещество — ее отвар с добавлением уксуса окрашивает
   текстиль в черный цвет. 

Рябина помогала птицеловам

   Рябина — растение неприметное, хотя и относится к деревьям, которые
   распускают листья довольно рано. Из-за перистых листьев ее легко
   перепутать с молодым ясенем. Только когда на рябине появляются характерные
   плоды, ее красота вспыхивает сама собой, показывая миру истинное лицо
   этого дерева. 

   Так как ягоды рябины — любимое лакомство птиц, птицеловы столетиями
   использовали их как приманку в хитроумных ловушках. Крестьянам охота на
   крупную дичь была запрещена, и птицы служили им важным дополнительным
   источником питания. Sorbus aucuparia, ботаническое название рябины
   обыкновенной, как раз указывает на это, поскольку эпитет aucuparia
   происходит от латинского aves capere, что означает не что иное, как
   «ловить птиц». 

Тополь — дерево художников и рыбаков

   Тополь черный входит в список деревьев, находящихся под угрозой. Гораздо
   чаще встречаются другие виды рода Populus (тополь серебристый, осина
   обыкновенная), а также различные гибриды. Все представители рода —
   светолюбивые и быстрорастущие деревья. Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни у
   них составляет около 100 лет, но известны также редкие экземпляры в
   возрасте приблизительно 300 лет. Диаметр ствола тополя черного может
   значительно превосходить 2 метра; в защищенных условиях дерево может
   вытянуться на 30-метровую высоту.

   Тополь невероятно полезное дерево. Раньше из его древесины делали обувь, а
   корни использовали для изготовления плетеных вещей, а из лыка плели
   рыболовные сети. Из древесины тополя делают спички, поскольку она медленно
   горит. В тополе содержится много целлюлозы, так что из него можно
   производить бумагу. Мягкая древесина тополя легко поддается обработке и
   была популярна у художников эпохи Ренессанса.

Для разных музыкальных инструментов нужны разные породы древесины

   Горные ели особенно ценятся в производстве скрипок. Страдивари и Гварнери
   часто неделями искали подходящие деревья, выстукивая и прослушивая тысячи
   стволов, прежде чем найти «правильную» ель. Создание одной скрипки могло
   стать делом всей жизни: древесину выбранного дерева нужно было сушить и
   выдерживать еще несколько десятков лет. Мастера добивались, чтобы
   древесина пришла в гармонию с колебаниями струн и была особенно устойчива
   к перепадам влажности.

   Древесина рябины глоговины также относится к самым востребованным и
   ценным, ведь она очень прочная. Сегодня ее используют в невероятно сложных
   процессах изготовления волынок и труб для органа. А вот для щипковых и
   струнных инструментов лучше всего подходит древесина клена и липы – у них
   замечательные резонансные свойства и вибрационные характеристики.

   Груша традиционно играет особую роль в изготовлении музыкальных
   инструментов: например, у блок-флейт из этого дерева особый мягкий и
   теплый тембр. Кроме того, духовые инструменты изготавливают из клена,
   бузины, самшита и сосны. А еще из сосновой смолы производят канифоль, без
   которой невозможно обойтись при игре на скрипке, альте, виолончели и
   контрабасе.

Конский каштан сажали для производства пива

   В отличие от многих других деревьев, конский каштан не находит широкого
   применения в хозяйстве или производстве по причине мягкости, непрочности
   и недолговечности. Его древесину использовали, пожалуй, только для
   изготовления кухонных принадлежностей и мебели, а также рукояток и
   округлых дверных ручек. 

   Зато конский каштан сыграл важную роль в истории пивоварения! Эти красивые
   растения сажали в садах многих пивных и пивоварен, особенно в Южной
   Германии. В тени таких деревьев охлаждали пивные бочки. Сегодня их также
   часто высаживают во двориках под открытым небом ради создания неповторимой
   атмосферы и уюта. Эти деревья дарят свою тень и любителям пива, защищая их
   от внезапно разразившегося затяжного дождя.

Бук помогает написать историю человечества

   Гладкая серебристая кора бука прямо-таки просит, чтобы на ней вырезали
   послания для будущих поколений, чтобы доверяли мощному дереву на хранение
   кусочек себя самого. Бесчисленные пары влюбленных под сенью зеленых сводов
   отдают друг другу свои сердца, а затем вырезают сердечки на стволе мощного
   бука. 

   Это не новое явление: языческие предки современных немцев тысячи лет назад
   тоже вырезали изображения в основном на буке, но оставляли не
   свидетельства романтических чувств, а пиктограммы, магические знаки и
   символы. Это были письменные знаки древних германцев — руны (от корня run
   — тайна). Древние жрецы использовали руны в защитных чарах, для магических
   исцелений и предсказаний. Они составили алфавит из 24 графем, который был
   похож на современный, но использовался исключительно для культовых целей.
   Люди срезали безупречные прямые веточки, на них вырезали руны и перед
   принятием важных решений задавали вопросы оракулу из таких буковых
   палочек. Даже немецкое слово Buchstabe — «буква» — происходит от
   Buchenstäbchen — «буковая палочка». Считается, что русское «буква» также
   восходит к слову «бук». Символично, что Иоганн Гутенберг изобрел
   книгопечатание с помощью вырезанной из бука буквы.

   Памятка по посадке плодовых деревьев

                      Памятка по посадке плодовых деревьев

   Памятка по посадке плодовых деревьев

   На легких суглинках с глубоким залеганием грунтовых вод (около 2-х метров)
   ямы под яблони и груши на сильнорослом подвое копают диаметром не менее
   1-го метра и глубиной 60 сантиметров. Для деревьев на полукарликовом
   подвое диаметр ямы - 1 метр и глубина 40 сантиметров. Для низкорослых
   карликовых диаметр 90 сантиметров, глубина - 40 сантиметров. Вишню, сливу,
   облепиху, черноплодную рябину, иргу сажают в ямы диаметром 50 сантиметров,
   глубиной - 30 сантиметров. Для посадки одного-двухлетнего саженца
   виногорада копают яму глубиной и шириной 50-60 сантиметов.

   На тяжелой глинистой почве ямы делают шире, но мельче, так как из-за
   плохой проницаемости глины, вода будет застаиваться и корни начнут
   подгнивать. На плотных, тяжелых почвах вилами или лопатой необходимо
   разрыхлить дно и боковые стенки ямы, иначе корни посаженных растений,
   достигая уплотненного слоя, будут закольцовываться и оставаться в
   ограниченном объёме посадочной ямы. Если почвы на участке тяжелые и
   уровень грунтовых вод на глубине менее 1,5 м., необходимо сооружение
   дренажа. Как вариант, в таких местах возможна посадка деревьем и крупных
   кустарников на грядах и искусственных возвышениях. 

   Яму заправляют плодородным субстратом, который готовится путём смешивания
   верхнего слоя с дерновой и листовой землей, торфом, перегноем и песком в
   разных пропорциях, в зависимости от высаживаемой культуры. На дно ямы
   добавляют органические и минеральные удобрения, но так, чтобы корни
   саженцев непосредственно с ними не контактировали. При посадке не следует
   злоупотреблять внесением минеральных удобрений; при разовом внесении
   больших доз минеральных удобрений, корни саженца оказываются не способными
   эффективно снабжать растение влагой. В центре ямы устанавливается кол, к
   которому потом будет привязано деревце. Дерево устанавливают с северной
   или северо-восточной стороны кола (он предохранит дерево от перегрева
   солнечными лучами). Подвязывать дерево нужно "восьмёркой", чтобы оно не
   повисло на колу после оседания почвы.

   Общее правило при посадке всех плодовых саженцев: контейнер с саженцем
   перед посадкой необходимо погрузить в емкость с водой на 1-2 часа, для
   того, чтоб земляной ком пропитался водой. Так же важна глубина посадки:
   корневая шейка саженца не должна быть заглублена,  этом случае деревья
   сильнее страдают от морозов, ожогов, рака и пятнистости листьев. Многие
   садоводы путают корневую шейку с местом прививки, чтобы правильно
   определить местонахождение корневой шейки, протрите сырой тряпочкойчасть
   ствола (штамб) и начало основных (скелетных) корней. Вы заметите, что в
   одном месте кора на дереве меняет цвет: из зеленоватой она становится
   светло-коричневой, это место и есть граница корневойшейки. При посадке
   корневую шейку располагают на 3-6 сантитметров выше уровня почвы, после
   усадки земли она окажется на уровне поверхности почвы. 

   При посадке почву вокруг саженцев уплотняют, а сверху по контуру
   посадочной ямы устраивают земляные валики высотой 10-15 сантиметров, и
   независимо от погоды обильно поливают (2-3 ведра воды на каждое растение).
   После полива лунку мульчируют слоем торфа, компоста или старой листвы. Это
   не позволит влаге быстро испариться и на поверхности почвы не образуется
   корка.

   После посадки (через 7-10 дней) поливают стимулятором корнеобразования и
   проводят внекорневые подкормки. Хорошие результаты даёт ЭПИН (7-10 капель
   на стакан воды) и ЦИРКОН (1 мл. на 10 литров воды).

                               Броуновское дерево

   Материал из Википедии — свободной энциклопедии
   Перейти к навигации Перейти к поиску
   [IMG]Пример броуновского дерева [IMG]Броуновское дерево, выращенное из
   медного купороса

   Бро́уновское де́рево является формой компьютерного искусства, которое было
   популярно в 1990-х, когда домашние компьютеры стали обладать достаточной
   производительностью для моделирования броуновского движения (отсюда и
   название). Броуновские деревья — математические модели древовидных
   структур, связанных с физическим процессом, известным как агрегация,
   ограниченная диффузией.

   Компьютерная модель агрегации, ограниченной диффузией^[en] представляет
   собой поле, заполненное частицами, совершающими хаотическое броуновское
   движение. На поле вносится центр агрегации, к которому «прилипает» всякая
   случайно прикоснувшаяся частица; начинается рост конгломерата частиц —
   фрактального кластера. Зачастую в моделировании используется только одна
   движущаяся частица.

   У получающегося дерева может быть много различных форм, преимущественно
   зависящих от трёх факторов:

     * положение центра агрегации;
     * начальное положение движущейся частицы;
     * алгоритм моделирования броуновского движения;

   При изменении цвета частицы между итерациями можно наблюдать интересные
   цветовые эффекты.

   В период популярности этого искусства средний персональный компьютер
   тратил часы и даже дни для создания маленького дерева. Современные
   персональные компьютеры могут создавать деревья из многих тысяч частиц за
   считанные секунды.

   Подобные деревья могут быть выращены в камере электролитического

   Гороскоп деревьев древнего календаря друидов
   Гороскоп деревьев древнего календаря друидов

Загадочные мудрецы друиды умели делать точные предсказания, предпочитали жить в
лесу и даже составили свой собственный гороскоп.

   Для того чтобы получить почетное звание друида, человек должен был
   провести двадцать лет в полном одиночестве в лесу.
   Лес они считали святым местом. С деревьями жрецы обходились как с живыми
   существами, наделяя их душой и даже характером. Они утверждали, что каждое
   дерево, как и человек, имеет свои определенные черты, достоинства и
   недостатки. Каждое требует определенных условий жизни.

    Согласно их науке, дата рождения каждого человека связана с определенным
    растением. Положение Солнца относительно Земли служит основой их гороскопа.
    В соответствии с ним, судьба человека, его будущее, характер и способности
    зависят от удаления Солнца от Земли в день его рождения. Поэтому каждый знак
    гороскопа друидов имеет два периода действия.

   Друиды верили: чтобы изменить свою судьбу к лучшему, нужно наладить связь
   со своим деревом: общаться с ним при помощи прикосновений. Считалось, что
   в сложное время человек должен пойти в лес или сад, найти дерево,
   соответствующее дате рождения, и поговорить с ним, прислониться к его
   стволу и физически представить себе, как энергия дерева перетекает в его
   тело. После чего полагалось поклониться дереву, поблагодарить его и
   напоследок украсить ленточкой.

   Вот так выглядит гороскоп друидов (в скобках указаны периоды, в которые
   владычествует данное дерево). Считалось, что наибольшую магическую силу и,
   как следствие, наибольшую помощь своему человеку дерево оказывает в
   периоды своего верховенства.

  Яблоня

   Яблоня радует взгляд — она очень привлекательна, очаровательна,
   сентиментальна и нежна. Часто она вступает в брак, не испытывая больших
   чувств к партнеру (яблоня — очень универсальное дерево, умеет хорошо
   подстраиваться), но это не означает, что она окончательно готова
   отказаться от этого прекрасного чувства. Если судьба пошлет ей партнера,
   полностью подходящего по духу, то их брак станет истинным наслаждением для
   обоих. Яблоня очень лояльна и терпима в отношениях, с ней легко.

   Гороскоп друидов говорит, что люди-яблони бескорыстные и доверчивые, их
   можно легко обмануть. Они добрые, если надо, снимут последнюю рубашку.

   Эти люди нередко живут, не думая о завтрашнем дне, именно сегодня, здесь и
   сейчас. Бывает, что берут в долг и забывают об этом. Любят жизнь,
   философствовать, фантазировать и не любят что-то кому-то доказывать.
   Однако, не стоит принимать яблоню как легкомысленное создание. Будучи
   умными и продуманными людьми, яблони склонны к обучению и наукам. Они
   читают все, что связано с областью, которая им интересна. Объем их знаний
   на удивление большой, но они никого не стремятся поразить этим.

   Однообразное «гладкое» счастье, без каких-либо недостатков, приносит
   яблоне скуку. Эти люди, время от времени, любят усложнять себе жизнь.

  Пихта

   Она красива своей «простой», а иногда даже холодной красотой. Любит
   антикварную бижутерию, легкие ароматы и полные загадочности праздники.

   Пихта капризна и с ней не всегда легко ладить. Имея сильное чувство
   самодостаточности, она отлично чувствует себя в одиночестве. Но

   всегда выслушает окружающих и может последовать чьему-то совету. Свою
   собственную позицию, между тем, высказывает редко. Не слишком болтливый,
   но веселый человек.

   Гордая, упрямая, способная достигать своих целей — пихта имеет успех в
   жизни. А вот в любовных делах ей бывает трудно угодить. Очень
   требовательна и бескомпромиссна. Хочет многого от жизни, а поскольку знает
   свои возможности, то обычно это получает. Может влюбляться, а затем
   полностью все разрушать. Но и ее любовь может не иметь границ.

   Гороскоп деревьев сообщает, что пихта мыслит научным способом, но не
   всегда это приводит ее к желаемому успеху. Случается так, что она выбирает
   то поле деятельности, которое не имеет ничего общего с ее способностями.

   Однако, она серьезный, скрупулезный и ответственный работник, и благодаря
   этому может достичь определенных успехов в карьере. Но имеет привычку
   выбирать самые трудные пути. Вообще, создание сложных ситуаций для себя и
   для других — это ее призвание.

   Эти люди благородны, что бы ни случилось — вы можете полностью полагаться
   на них. В любой ситуации они могут сохранить присутствие ума.

  Вяз

   Вяз не слишком заботится о себе, он просто одевается, часто не может
   выбросить старый свитер или потертые джинсы. Не требовательный и не любит
   усложнять свою жизнь. Самым большим недостатком людей-вязов является лень.

   Несмотря на их внешнюю силу и мощь, вязы имеют слабое здоровье.

   Это открытые и щедрые люди, что иногда даже обескураживает. Они верят в
   доброту других. Не боятся неудач, ведь знают, что могут быть намного
   сильнее, чем многие других в их ситуации.

   Для родных эти люди способны сделать все, что угодно, у них сильное
   чувство ответственности и долга.

   В любви вяз страстный, иногда даже очень. Если он находит настоящую
   любовь, то создает удивительно крепкую и образцовую семью (при поддержке
   партнера, естественно). Но любит править, его требования столь же высоки,
   как и его любовь. Относитесь к нему терпеливо, он этого заслуживает, вязы
   — очень верные люди. Острый ум и растущие из нужного места руки, станут
   отличным подспорьем в семье.

   Обычно жизнь этих людей проходит без каких-либо сильных потрясений. Они
   добиваются всего, чего хотят для себя.

  Кипарис

   Стройный, с резко очерченным силуэтом и простыми правильными чертами.
   Однако, он не без утонченности. В нем ничего от человека, испорченного
   благами цивилизации и современного мира.

   Кипарис может довольствоваться совсем немногим в этой жизни, к любой
   ситуации адаптируется достаточно легко. Жить способен в любых условиях, и
   это не помешает стать ему счастливым.

   Не придает большого значения успеху в жизни, деньги и слава для него
   далеко не самое главное. Его цель — быть счастливым, и в ее достижении его
   невозможно остановить.

   Кипарис любит легкие летние прогулки, животных и природу. Его не пугает
   одиночество, он наслаждается им. Но свою жизнь будет выстраивать таким
   образом, чтобы всегда находиться в окружении друзей и семьи.

   Не сентиментальный человек. Бывает довольно груб, но в нем есть внутренняя
   теплота. С ним приятно находиться рядом, его присутствие успокаивает.

   Обожает мечтать, часто его мысли улетают куда-то далеко. Острых тем в
   разговоре избегает, независимо от своей точки зрения. Но устроить дебаты
   не прочь, и к его мнению прислушиваются. Гибкий и верный в дружбе и любви.

   Чаще всего жизнь этих людей проходит легко и спокойно среди тех, кто ему
   дорог.

  Тополь

   С юности в нем есть некоторая декоративность, утонченная форма и красота.
   Однако, становясь старше, он доставляет неприятности самому себе: из-за
   своей сильной чувствительности ко времени и боязни старости, тополь
   выглядит старше, чем он есть на самом деле. Но поддержка и похвала близких
   могут помочь ему, поэтому эти люди тщательно выбирают людей, с которыми
   будут общаться.

   В друидском гороскопе по дате рождения сказано, что тополю нужно быть
   осторожным с выбором места жительства и работы. Окружающая обстановка
   очень важна для этих людей. Они очень нуждаются в друзьях, общении и
   комфорте, и бывает, что часто страдают от того, что выбрали неправильную
   окружающую среду.

   Тополь очень чувствителен к ограничениям свободы и может легко впасть в
   депрессию, если его пытаться «посадить на поводок».

   Любовь его хрупка, любая, даже самая мелкая, неприятность может вывести
   его из равновесия и все испортить. Поэтому в браке с ним бывает сложно,
   однако, он сам способен сглаживать те или иные острые углы, без истерик и
   с улыбкой.

   Возможно, вас заинтересует статья о том, как узнать свой тотем. В ней мы
   рассказали о том, как найти свое тотемное животное.

   Те, кто мало знаком с тополем, будут считать его веселым и спокойным
   человеком, но это не всегда так.

   Эти люди не материалисты, они настроены на альтруизм. У них острый ум, они
   проницательны, иногда кажутся высокомерными.

   Тополей много среди врачей.

  Кедр

   Мощный кедр имеет довольно-таки внушительный вид. Он способен подстроиться
   под любую ситуацию. Не против комфорта, но если придется может и на
   лавочке в парке поспать. Имеет превосходное здоровье и для него это важно.

   Не знает, что такое застенчивость и везде чувствует себя как дома. Уверен
   в себе, и это притягивает людей. Но в тоже время, кедр очень чувствителен
   к шуткам относительно него самого, он их вряд ли оценит.

   Ему нравится свобода, он обожает находиться в центре внимания, и будет к
   этому стремиться. Считает, что последнее слово всегда за ним.

   Иногда склонен к излишествам, причем во всех жизненных аспектах.

   Не знает страха, способен выйти «сухим из воды». Сложные ситуации не
   ломают его, кедр — неисправимый оптимист. Но при всей своей видимой мощи,
   он может попасть под чье-то влияние. Грамотный манипулятор способен «вить
   из него веревки». Но и на окружающих люди-кедры могут оказывать
   колоссальное влияние.

   Кедр очень преданный своему делу человек, возможно поэтому среди них много
   героев и мучеников. Это настойчивые люди, которые считают, что всегда
   правы.

   Однако, в любви он мягкий, нежный и сентиментальный. К объекту страсти
   прикипает навсегда, и при таком раскладе будет воспринимать эти чувства,
   как нечто высшее.

   Очень умный человек, скорость его мыслей и решений удивительна. Имеет
   творческие способности, в основном в музыке, возможно, это из-за
   врожденного чувства ритма.

   Рожденный для приключений, кедр обычно имеет довольно насыщенную жизнь.

  Сосна

   У нее изысканный силуэт, она изящная, это подчеркивает ее достоинства.
   Если верить гороскопу друидов, она всегда знает, чего хочет, и не
   позволяет течению просто нести ее по волнам, ей недостаточно того, что
   жизнь дает сама, всегда нужно большего. И эти люди умеют достигать своих
   целей.

   Будучи мужественной, сосна встречает любую проблему с высоко поднятой
   головой, и не позволяет, каким-то жизненным трудностям одолеть ее. В
   работе может иметь успех на любом поле деятельности.

   Сосна отличается упорством, с которым она идет по жизни. Очень быстрая и
   точная в действиях, она может выйти из любой сложной ситуации.

   Несмотря на приветливость и умение быть хорошим другом, эти люди не
   отличаются чрезмерной щедростью. Они немного эгоисты, собственные
   процветание и комфорт — прежде всего.

   Слабость проявляют только в одном — в любви. Они чувствительны и
   импульсивны — могут легко влюбиться, натворить опрометчивых поступков,
   думать о которых будет уже слишком поздно.

   При всем этом, у сосен проницательный ум и хорошие организаторские
   способности. Благодаря своему пробивному характеру они справляются с
   любыми проблемами, даже любовными.

   Особенно благоприятно покровительство сосны для женщин.

  Ива

   Ива привлекает своей меланхолической красотой, даже если не брать в расчет
   ее видимое очарование, в ней все равно есть что-то загадочное.

   Эти люди очень мягки, любят солнышко, и умеют ловить моменты радости.

   Но не верьте внешней нежности ивы. Она весьма решительная, хорошо знает,
   чего хочет. Никогда не будет что-то навязывать кому-то, все дело в
   огромном чувстве уважения к окружающим.

   Ее беспомощность — лишь уловка, иногда для развлечения, а иногда и ради
   личной выгоды, ива может притвориться слабой и беззащитной, но если
   потребуется, защитить себя тоже сможет превосходно.

   У ивы бывают моменты меланхоличности. Но не воспринимайте слишком серьезно
   ее осенние настроения и разговоры о быстротечности жизни. Ивы склонны к
   драматизму, в этом их сложность, не все способны это понять и принять.

   Людям-ивам сложно пройти быструю адаптацию, они не любят компромиссы.
   Здесь придется только смириться, потому как «переделать» их под себя не
   получится.

   В любви ива больше романтична, чем сентиментальна. Не любит обычных,
   тусклых чувств. К тому же, любовь без страданий не имеют слишком высокой
   ценности для нее, а потому, «для увеличения веса», ива привносит в них эту
   толику страданий.

   У нее есть хорошие творческие способности, интуиция и богатое воображение.
   Из таких людей получаются талантливые психологи.

  Липа

   Она потрясающе очаровательна и знает это. Мечтает о стабильной, комфортной
   жизни, но это для нее далеко не главное, и не всегда имеет какое-то
   весомое значение. Легко привыкает к любым жизненным условиям. Ей
   достаточно шалаша, чтобы создать атмосферу домашнего уюта и тепла.

   Липа выглядит слабой, тихой, загадочной, и со всем этим она безмятежна и
   даже немного пессимистична. Часто такие люди всю свою жизнь проживают с
   чувством скуки. Это их главный враг.

   Очень восприимчива к лести, не привыкла в чем-либо сомневаться и очень
   привлекательна. С такими людьми приятно и легко общаться, сразу появляется
   чувство психологического комфорта. Липа будет терпеливо слушать своего
   собеседника. Это, вообще, очень уважительные люди, которые с почтением
   относятся к своим родственникам, и не стремится манипулировать людьми. Их
   все любят.

   У липы практический ум и склонность к техническим наукам, она
   сообразительна и точна.

   Если в своей жизни она встречает вторую половинку — тогда супружеская
   любовь поможет избавиться от внутренних противоречий. Но с липой в
   отношениях сложно, не имея сильного чувства самоуважения, она часто
   ревнует, без причин.

   влияют на человека?

  Орешник

   Выглядит слабым и непривлекательным, но если с ним сблизиться, то вы,
   несомненно, уступите его очарованию. Очень умен и способен адаптироваться
   к различным жизненным условиям.

   В нем есть что-то магическое. Если орешник захочет, то сделает так, что
   окружающие начнут подстраиваться по него.

   Во всем гороскопе друидов нет более неоднозначного знака, чем орешник. Он
   может быть добрым, мудрым, терпеливым, но в тоже время и опасным, и злым.
   Все в нем — волшебство! И все зависит от его настроения или каприза. От
   этих людей можно ожидать чего угодно. С ними нужно быть очень осторожными
   — они довольно неуравновешенны.

   Несмотря на свою природную скромность, орешник очень оригинален, он
   относится к жизни по-разному. Способен угадывать самые тайные мысли и
   делать неожиданные предложения.

   В любви орешник может быть как самым милым, любящим и любимым, так и самым
   невыносимым партнером. Но если вы не боитесь рисковать, тогда проявите
   заботу о нем. И даже если совместная жизнь не принесет покоя, это все
   равно станет довольно увлекательным приключением.

   Эти люди очень эрудированы, быстро и легко учатся. Но, в общем и целом,
   все зависит только от их желания.

  Рябина (Пираканта)

   Ее нежный вид скрывает сильный характер. Она безумно очаровательная и
   почти всегда улыбается, но не из-за внутренней бодрости, а из-за
   самоконтроля. Рябина может подчеркнуть свои достоинства и любит хорошо
   одеваться. У нее от природы идеальный вкус. Моментально способна
   адаптироваться на месте, хорошо подстраивается под окружающих.

   Ей нравится радоваться людям и радовать их, даже в ущерб себе. Она не
   эгоцентрик, но эгоизм в ней, определенно, есть. Очень независима, но
   иногда позволяет другим думать, что это не так. Может страдать комплексом
   вины. Долго общаться с ней трудно, а отношения сложны.

   Рябина очень впечатлительна, особенно отличается своей любовью к
   совершенству и приветливостью. Вы всегда можете положиться на нее. Она
   мила, выглядит наивной и даже дурочкой, но не позволит другим
   эксплуатировать себя.

   В любви эти люди очень много отдают, но взамен требуют столько же. Им
   постоянно нужно испытывать чувства, и если вы не способны этого дать
   партнеру-рябине, то она вас разочарует. И помните, с рябиной нельзя шутить
   и обманывать ее, она не прощает подобных вещей.

   Рябина не предаст. Ее личная жизнь очень насыщенна и наполнена заботами и
   мечтами о завтрашнем дне. Такие люди осмотрительны, умны и практичны.
   Иногда случается так, что они не материализуют какие-то из своих планов,
   но это только из-за того, что слишком заняты повседневными делами.

  Клен

   Он эффектен, ухожен и чуточку кокетлив. Часто оказывается там, где
   происходят самые интересные вещи. Модник. Очень жизнерадостный и
   энергичный.

   Гороскоп деревьев говорит, что клен всегда на высоте. Индивидуалист,
   слегка сдержанный и не очень-то смелый. Рискованные решения принимать не
   любит, но может, и чаще всего они не касаются материальных вещей.

   Клен совсем не домосед, ему нужны новые люди, новые эмоции, новые
   впечатления! Он почти не бывает в той ситуации, когда вокруг нет друзей. У
   него они есть всегда, он притягивает людей, так как умеет дружить: никогда
   никого не не осудит и не выдаст чужие тайны.

   Обычно у этих людей много планов, часто весьма эксцентричных. Их
   захватывают новые идеи. Клены могут быть циниками, не любят и не боятся
   общественного мнения. И даже напротив, провоцируют людей говорить о них.

   В любви с кленом сложно, но свое счастье он всегда найдет, главное, как
   говорится, встретить своего человека.

   Клен не лишен воображения и интуиции, умен, в общем и целом, это очень
   универсальные и интересные люди.

  Грецкий орех

   Стильный, утонченный и привлекательный внешне, на деле он очень робкий.
   Грецкий орех соткан из противоречий:

   капризный,

   агрессивный,

   эгоистичный.

   Но очень приятный, вежливый и гостеприимный. Верный и надежный, он с
   легкостью может стать непостоянным. Никогда не знаешь, с какой стороны к
   нему подходить. Без каких-либо оснований грецкий орех может порадовать вас
   или обидеть.

   Иногда ему нравится пострадать, и он с удовольствием заставляет других
   страдать вместе с ним. С такими людьми нужно быть внимательными, иначе они
   полностью подчинят вас своей воле.

   В жизни грецкий орех отличный стратег. Он знает к чему приводят его
   намерения, нередко способен на совершение коварных поступков, и не сильно
   страдает от угрызения совести. Он часто доминирует над другими. Но бывают
   и очень скромные грецкие орехи.

   Такой человек стремится к тому, чтобы его жизнь была не обычной. Не боится
   никакого риска, не стремится угодить, не признает компромиссы, не идет по
   избитым дорогам. У грецкого ореха может быть много друзей, и так же много
   врагов. Он считает, что в жизни вы можете рассчитывать только на себя.
   Заботится только о своей независимости. Таких людей очень сложно
   игнорировать.

  Жасмин

   Живой и общительный, притягивает своим умением строить непринужденные
   беседы, и даже помимо своей воли, становится объектом всеобщего внимания.
   Для всех он кажется уравновешенным, смешным и не обремененным жизненными
   сложностями человеком. Но только самые близкие люди знают, насколько
   жасмин в действительности чувствителен. Его легко расстроить, возможно,
   именно поэтому много жасминов — пессимисты.

   Весьма скрытен и подозрителен. Но способен выстраивать гармоничные
   отношения и дипломатия ему не чужда. К сожалению, все это редко
   показывается в собственном доме. Здесь он не будет вести себя сдержано, не
   признает ограничений, а обязательства удручают его, несмотря на
   обостренное чувства долга.

   Ответственность не всегда приносит жасмину радость и удовлетворение, но
   она ему не чужда. Брак с ним очень тяжелый. Жасмин талантливо умеет
   разочаровывать партнеров. А вот детям с ним легко, ему с детьми, кстати,
   тоже. Малыши его обожают, а он способен дать им ответ на любой вопрос в
   простой и понятной форме. Дети — вот его радость в жизни.

   Эти люди не материалисты, но часто у них хороший заработок. Они не боятся
   труда, их ум и свежие идеи высоко ценятся руководством.

   описание и ссылки на подробные статьи.

  Каштан

   Каштан безумно красивый, возможно даже слегка декоративный, но своей
   привлекательностью он не стремиться покорить весь мир. Для жизни ему нужно
   пространство, он полон сил. В каштане есть врожденное чувство
   справедливости. Он готов бороться за свою правоту любыми способами,
   независимо от последствий.

   Ему не нравятся бережливость, любые тактические и дипломатические уловки,
   и это часто настраивает людей против него. Отсутствие согласия в общении с
   другими приводит к смене многих профессий и, конечно, к разочарованиям,
   которые он, из-за своей впечатлительности, помнит долго.

   Несмотря на свою настойчивость и самообладание, он не бывает упрямым,
   придает большое значение правилам морали. Во всем стремится к комфорту.

   Каштану очень трудно найти взаимопонимание с другими, поэтому иногда он
   имеет славу недобросовестного человека. Возможно, это связано с его
   страстью к шокированию других. Он требует большой любви, но сам может
   любить только однажды в жизни, поэтому ему трудно найти его счастье.
   Потребность в любви и одновременный страх перед беззащитной любовью делают
   его отношения очень трудными.

   Его комплексы ведут к провокационному поведению, которое часто непонятно
   для других.

  Ясень

   Несомненно, могучее дерево. Он элегантен и свободен в движениях.
   Самовлюблен и требователен. Хочет, чтобы о нем заботились, но сам он в это
   время будет делать только то, чего хочет. А если учесть то, свобода — для
   него главное, выдерживают такое общение далеко не все. Ужасный эгоист, но
   нисколько не скряга.

   К своим целям идет напролом, и не стоит находиться на его пути. Успеха
   ясень добьется в любом случае — это очень сильная натура.

   Однако, этот капризный человек совсем иначе ведет себя в любви —
   становится осмотрительным, постоянным, и очень разумным. Он почти не
   ошибается в выборе партнера и прилагает немало усилий, чтобы наладить свою
   семейную жизнь. Ясень, определенно, способен выстроить образцовый брак.

   Оригинален, отличается необыкновенной интуицией. Имеет дар
   проницательности, любит пророчествовать, и когда его предсказания
   действительно сбываются, тщеславие у ясеня начинает зашкаливать.

  Граб

   Очаровательный и милый внешне, граб совсем не такой внутри. На окружающий
   мир смотрит с некоторым снисхождением. Таких людей всегда интересует не
   сама конфета, а ее обертка. Очень послушный, а подчинение даже любит (в
   хорошем смысле слова), особенно ему нравится следовать установленным
   правилам, возможно, поэтому граб не инициативен.

   Очень боится ошибок, а потому терпеть не может принимать решения. Но за
   свои действия всегда готов нести ответственность. Очень консервативен, не
   любит новшеств.

   В любви эти люди очень честны. Они хорошие спутники жизни. Но если жизнь
   заставит его выбирать между любовью и долгом, он выберет последний.

  Инжир

   В нем нет какой-то особой красоты, но и не заметить его нельзя. Инжир
   немного впечатлительный и имеет свои комплексы, поэтому ему не везде
   бывает хорошо и комфортно. Трудности переживает очень плохо. Будучи
   впечатлительным, сильно подвержен грусти, которая его обязательно погубит.

   У него сильная связь с семьей. Очень эмоциональный, что отражается на его
   душевном спокойствии.

   Даже если инжиру что-то не нравится (а он об этом чаще всего промолчит),
   свои обязанности он все равно выполнит. Ленивый, но работает усердно. На
   этих людей всегда можно опереться.

   В браке с ним хорошо и легко. Но не ждите особой романтики, инжир ценит
   простые чувства без прикрас и лоска. Но, внимание: инжир очень легко
   обидеть!

  Дуб

   Он полон жизни, силы и красоты, в нем совершенно нет хрупкости. Он
   вызывает уважение и восторг, притягивает благодаря своему внушительному
   виду.

   Дуб имеет отличное здоровье, что для него крайне важно, так как болезни
   переносит очень плохо. Весьма храбрый, но его мужество продиктовано,
   скорее, феноменальной гордостью. Дуб не потерпит, чтобы окружающие сочли
   его трусом, а потому, на некоторые ситуации реагирует более жестко, чем
   следовало бы. Весьма последовательный, своих целей, как правило,
   достигает.

   Но есть и обратная сторона: подобная бескомпромиссность не позволяет дубу
   проявлять гибкость, что, конечно, вызывает проблемы. Он бы достигал
   больших успехов, если был бы более дипломатичным.

   Дуб не станет терпеть ограничений, и его действия часто граничат с
   произволом. Тем не менее он уважает мнение других.

   В любви ищет все время что-то новое, а потому часто становится жертвой
   неудачных отношений. Но в браке такой человек может остепениться.

   Дуб не любит перемен, он очень консервативен. Несмотря на свою,
   способность к бескорыстным действиям, о себе он тоже помнит, и всегда
   извлечет собственную выгоду. Жизнь других его мало интересует.

   Такие люди мыслят ясно, своим привычкам не изменяют. Обычно они
   обеспечивают полностью комфортное существования для своей семьи.

  Береза

   Она гибкая, простая и приятная в общении. Очень деликатная, не навязывает
   свое мнение, ни от кого ничего особого не ждет и редко сожалеет о
   чем-либо.

   Береза очень скромна, в ней от природы заложено чувство меры. Толерантна,
   но вот, что бесит березу, так это пошлость. Такие люди лишены всякой
   показухи, они не любят роскошь, в них нет снобизма. Несмотря на свою
   изящную внешность, береза не боится труда и любит работать.

   Предпочитает спокойную и тихую любовь. Однако, сильные яркие чувства ее не
   пугают. В своем доме легко создает уют и комфорт, причем не только для
   себя одной.

   Сила ее воображения и изобретательности просто не имеют границ! Очень
   часто береза выбирает себе творческую профессию. А способность мыслить
   логично и превращать в жизнь мечты, в сочетании с ее продуктивностью,
   открывает для березы все двери.

   Однако, и у таких людей бывают недостатки, и главный — необщительность. Но
   береза счастлива, ей это не мешает. Она так мало требует жизни, что ей
   достаточно, чтобы у нее был любящий человек рядом и хорошая библиотека под
   рукой.

  Олива

   Небольшая, иногда на грани красоты и уродства, но не лишенная своей
   прелести. Олива часто беспокоится о ревматизме, поэтому ей нравится солнце
   и она очень страдает от его отсутствия.

   Олива знает, что и у других может быть свое собственное мнение, а потому
   никогда не вмешивается в жизни людей. Деликатна до такой степени, что ее
   иногда обвиняют в равнодушии. Напротив, в случае необходимости к ней легко
   можно обратиться за помощью.

   В любой ситуации улыбается. Отчасти это связано с умением контролировать
   себя, но прежде всего из-за того, что нужно беречь нервную систему.

   Имеет врожденное чувство справедливости. Всегда может поставить себя на
   место других. Поэтому ее любят и ценят, хотя она ничего не делает, чтобы
   произвести впечатление на окружающих. Общается сдержанно.

   В любви олива пытается не ревновать, уважает независимость партнера, даже
   если это причиняет страдания. Но это не делает ее слабой. Просто, самое
   важное для нее — покой. Несмотря на то, что она не стремится к этому, она
   всегда привлекает внимание к себе и иногда может стать знаменитой.

   Это одни из тех людей, которые приносят отдых и счастье другим, оставляя
   после себя приятные воспоминания.

  Бук

   Он стройный и красивый, причем свою хорошую форму, величественный силуэт,
   ловкость и гибкость движений способен сохранить до старости. Всегда
   заботится о внешнем виде, и не лишен некоторого кокетства. Если попадает в
   хорошие условия — достигает успеха в любой области. Полон различных
   планов, которые может успешно реализовать. Не позволяет никому и ничему
   увести его с выбранного пути. Может хорошо устроить свою жизнь.

   Бук способен на щедрость, хотя обычно он бережливый и правильно
   организовывает свой бюджет. Не любит делиться своим имуществом. Бук —
   приличное создание, у него много хороших привычек, он всегда взвешивает
   все за и против, никогда не полагается на удачу.

   В любви ему не хватает фантазии, но супруг он идеальный. Стремится к тому,
   чтобы иметь детей, любит обустраивать свой дом.

   Умный, обладает определенными талантами и здравым смыслом. Материалист,
   сначала хочет стать богатым, а после этого, если возможно, счастливым.

   Как видите, галльский гороскоп — очень интересен. И весьма разнопланов,
   тут мы описали лишь его часть.

                           Высадить 60 тысяч деревьем

   Высадить 60 тысяч деревьем
   1 сентября 2023
   Министерство природных ресурсов и экологии Свердловской области определило
   первые участки в региональных лесничествах для проведения акции «Сохраним
   лес». Для проведения посадочных работ выделены 13 территорий общей
   площадью 24,2 гектара в Алапаевском, Верхнетуринском, Ивдельском,
   Ирбитском, Карпинском, Серовском, Таборинском и Талицком районах, где
   запланировано высадить около 60 тысяч деревьев.
   В 2023 году всероссийская акция «Сохраним лес» пройдет в пятый раз.
   Мероприятия, помогающие сохранять и восстанавливать леса проводятся в
   рамках национального проекта «Экология».
   «Свердловская область никогда не остается в стороне при проведении акции
   «Сохраним лес». Участие в ней принимают тысячи уральцев – сотрудники
   лесничеств, работники предприятий, члены общественных организаций,
   волонтёры. В этом году будут высажены саженцы ели, кедра, сосны, липы и
   дуба», – рассказал министр природных ресурсов и экологии Свердловской
   области Денис Мамонтов.
   Самый большое количество деревьев планируется высадить Верхнетуринском
   городском округе. Там для проведения акции «Сохраним лес» выделено три
   участка общей площадью 10,8 гектара, на которых появятся 27,1 тысячи
   саженцев ели.
   Отметим, в регионе используется собственный посадочный материал,
   выращенный в питомниках из заготовленных уральских семян. Всего в 2023
   году будет восстановлено более 30 тысяч гектаров свердловских лесов.
   Специалисты Уральской авиалесоохраны, лесничеств и арендаторы проведут
   лесовосстановительные работы на местах плановых вырубок и площадях,
   пострадавших от лесных пожаров.
   Почти семь тысяч гектаров займут сеянцы сосен и елей – их высадят в том
   числе и на местах, где ранее деревья полностью погибли. Лесовостановление
   на таких участках начинается минимум через год после пожаров – площади
   перед высадкой деревьев необходимо обследовать и подготовить.
   Напомним, акция «Сохраним лес» – это масштабный всероссийский
   лесовосстановительный проект, направленный на восстановление зелёных
   насаждений, погибших вследствие пожаров, вырубок или других негативных
   факторов. Впервые акцию «Сохраним лес» провели в 2019 году. С того момента
   к ней присоединилось шесть миллионов участников, которые высадили более
   222 миллионов деревьев. Экологическая инициатива стала по праву считаться
   одной из крупнейших в России.
   Принять участие в акции может любой желающий – достаточно зайти на сайт
   сохранимлес.рф, найти свой регион, зарегистрироваться на событие и быть на
   месте в назначенное время.

    Крым

   498 тысяч человек остались без света в Крыму из-за отключений линий
   электропередачи в результате шторма, который пришел на юг Украины
   и в приграничные российские регионы 26 ноября, сообщил советник главы
   аннексированного полуострова Олег Крючков. Самые пострадавшие районы
   полуострова — Черноморский, Сакский, Белогорский, Симферопольский,
   Октябрьский, Бахчисарайский, Ленинский. На территории некоторых
   муниципальных образований объявлен режим чрезвычайной ситуации.

   Жители Черноморского района остались без воды и теплоснабжения. В Саках
   произошла авария на газопроводе. Из-за падения опоры электропередач
   перекрыта дорога между селами Митяево и Трудовое Сакского района. Еще
   несколько участков дорог на полуострове подтопило. В Севастополе ветром
   повалило 189 деревьев и сорвало рекламные щиты. В городе повреждены кровли
   42 домов. От падения деревьев и конструктивных элементов зданий пострадало
   42 автомобиля. Затопило один из залов местного морского аквариума-музея,
   погибло более 500 морских животных. Директор аквариума накануне сообщал,
   что погибли 800 животных.

   По предварительным данным властей аннексированного Крыма, один человек
   погиб в районе Судака. Во время шторма он вышел смотреть на волны. В МЧС
   сообщили о пропавшем без вести и четверых пострадавших. Минздрав
   РФ сообщил о семи пострадавших в Евпатории. В Севастополе пострадали три
   человека. Точное число пострадавших на полуострове сейчас неизвестно.

     Обновление. Один человек погиб и 10 пострадали из-за непогоды в Крыму,
     уточнили в МЧС России. Более 350 человек эвакуированы. Еще два человека
     погибли во время шторма в Сочи, сообщили оперштаб Краснодарского края
     и управление МВД по региону.

   В Евпатории, где море вышло из берегов, спасатели эвакуировали 142
   человека из 40 подтопленных домов и приусадебных участков. Еще 100 человек
   эвакуированы из отеля «Рибера», который находится на побережье.
   В нескольких районах Крыма повреждена курортная инфраструктура. Сотрудники
   МЧС вывозят людей из подтопленных домов и в других частях полуострова.

   Накануне глава аннексированного Крыма Сергей Аксенов объявил понедельник
   выходным днем для жителей региона. В Севастополе 27 ноября не будут
   работать школы, детские сады и учреждения социальной сферы. Общественный
   транспорт на полуострове также будет работать в режиме выходного дня.
   Жителей Крыма попросили не выезжать на дороги на личном транспорте.
   В регионе действует штормовое предупреждение из-за ураганного ветра
   порывами до 40 метров в секунду.

    Краснодарский край

   Шторм сорвал с якоря сухогруз под флагом Белиза, находившийся под
   погрузкой ячменя для Египта в морском порту Тамань. Судно дрейфовало около
   двух часов, пока его не выбросило на мель в районе Анапы. На борту
   находился 21 член экипажа — граждане Сирии, Индии и Египта. О пострадавших
   не сообщается.

   В Сочи и Адлере ветром повалило деревья. Из-за сильного ветра и высоких
   волн в Сочи закрыты пляжи. 10 самолетов, следовавших в аэропорт Сочи, ушли
   на запасные аэродромы в Минеральные Воды. Позже они вернулись в аэропорт
   Сочи. 26 ноября на одну из контактных линий железнодорожных путей упало
   дерево. Еще одно дерево рухнуло на остановку, где в тот момент находились
   люди. В РЖД сообщили, что из-за непогоды в Краснодарском крае
   задерживаются порядка 50 поездов.

   В школах и детсадах Анапы отменили занятия.

   На Кубани действуют семь штормовых предупреждений. Сильное волнение моря
   наблюдается в Анапе, Геленджике, Новороссийске и Туапсинском районе.
   В 43 муниципалитетах возможны подъемы уровней рек и очень сильный ветер,
   сообщил оперативный штаб региона. В Сочи ожидается сильный снег.

    Самопровозглашенные ДНР и ЛНР, аннексированная Запорожская область

   22 населенных пункта в самопровозглашенной ЛНР остались без света из-за
   непогоды.

   В самопровозглашенной ДНР электричество отключено у 525 тысяч абонентов.
   В регионе ветер повалил деревья и оборвал линии электропередачи. Несколько
   населенных пунктов остались без воды. В Донецке обесточены 214 котельных
   и 20 подстанций, электричества также нет примерно у 190 тысяч абонентов.

   В захваченной РФ части Запорожской области электроснабжения нет у 37 тысяч
   абонентов. Пять районов Бердянска подтоплены. Средний уровень воды
   достигает 40 сантиметров.

    Одесская область

   В Одесской области, куда шторм пришел 26 ноября, спасатели продолжают
   ликвидировать последствия непогоды, задействовав в числе прочего
   бронетранспортеры. К утру 27 ноября полиция получила сообщения о 71 аварии
   на дорогах, занесенных снегом. В Одессе по состоянию на 7:00 (8:00 мск)
   зафиксировали 78 обрывов контактной сети городского электротранспорта:
   движение большей части трамваев и троллейбусов приостановлено. Вечером
   26 ноября в городе отключили районные котельные. Мэр Одессы Геннадий
   Труханов сообщил, что на территории одной из котельных упала 100-метровая
   труба.

   Все учебные заведения Одесской области перешли на дистанционное обучение.
   Детские сады и школы будут работать в режиме дежурных групп, сообщил
   губернатор региона Олег Кипер.

   Самая сложная ситуация на севере и юге Одесской области, где снежные
   заносы достигают полутора метров, сообщили в МВД Украины. В селе Удобное
   под Одессой пограничники эвакуировали из автобусов 42 человека, в том
   числе 10 детей. На трассе Измаил — Рени спасатели освободили шесть
   человек. Еще шесть человек обратились к врачам с признаками
   переохлаждения. Всего из-за непогоды были отбуксированы более 500 единиц
   автотранспорта, в том числе 14 автобусов и 12 автомобилей экстренной
   помощи.

   Из-за непогоды по всей Украине обесточены 2019 населенных пунктов в 16
   областях, перекрыто движение по 14 дорогам, отбуксировано 840 автомобилей.
   В МВД Украины призвали водителей избегать поездок по регионам, куда пришел
   шторм и ураганы.

     * По делу о спиленном «дереве Робин Гуда» задержали 16-летнего подростка —
     и отпустили. Затем задержали мужчину старше 60 лет — и тоже отпустили

   12:13, 2 октября 2023
   Источник: The Chronicle

   Второй подозреваемый по уголовному делу, которое возбудили после
   уничтожения легендарного «дерева Робин Гуда» — белого клена в графстве
   Нортумберленд — вышел под залог. Об этом сообщает газета The Chronicle.

   Подозреваемого в преднамеренном акте вандализма — мужчину «старше 60
   лет» — задержали в минувшую пятницу, 29 сентября. Его имя не раскрывалось.
   Полиция сообщила о его задержании в день, когда первый фигурант дела —
   16-летний подросток — вышел под залог.

   В сети появились предположения, что дерево спилил бывший дровосек,
   69-летний Уолтер Ренвик, который недавно лишился прав на недвижимость,
   но Ренвик заявил The Sun, что не причастен к случившемуся.

   Белый клен стоял в национальном парке Нортумберленд в лощине «Сикамор-гэп»
   рядом с валом Адриана. Клен прозвали «деревом Робин Гуда», поскольку рядом
   с ним снимали некоторые сцены фильма «Робин Гуд — принц воров» 1991 года
   с Кевином Костнером в главной роли. Дерево, считавшееся одной из самых
   известных достопримечательностей Англии, спилили в ночь на 28 сентября.

    На севере Англии спилили знаменитое «дерево Робин Гуда» — ему несколько

   10:06, 29 сентября 2023
   Источник: Meduza

   Британская полиция задержала 16-летнего подростка, подозреваемого в том,
   что он спилил белый клен в национальном парке графства Нортумберленд
   на севере Англии. Это дерево называют одной из самых известных
   достопримечательностей страны, сообщает «Би-би-си». Огромный клен
   несколько столетий рос в лощине «Сикамор-гэп» рядом с валом Адриана и был
   особенно почитаем местными жителями и туристами как важный и знаковый
   элемент ландшафта. Его также называли «деревом Робин Гуда» — рядом с этим
   кленом снимались некоторые сцены фильма «Робин Гуд — принц воров» 1991
   года с Кевином Костнером в главной роли. Полиция считает случившееся
   «преднамеренным актом вандализма». Задержанный подросток сотрудничает
   со следствием, однако его мотивы пока не ясны.

   [IMG]Древо жизни, лев, единорог и символическая стража сундука. Рисунок на
   сундуке. Северная Двина. 1688 год

   Дерево жизни (древо жизни, ивр. עֵץ הַחַיִים‎: эц hа-хаим, церк.-слав.
   древо животное, райское древо) — мифологический образ во многих культурах.
   В славянской народной традиции вариант мирового древа. В фольклоре —
   мотив, отражающий представления о библейском древе жизни посреди рая
   (Быт. 2:9). Концепция Древа Жизни использовалась в религии, философии и
   мифологии^[1]. Обозначает взаимосвязь всей жизни на планете и служит
   метафорой для общего происхождения в эволюционном смысле^[2].

   Термин древо жизни может также быть использован в качестве синонима
   священного древа^[3].

   Древо знания, связывающее небеса и подземный мир, а также древо жизни,
   связывающее все формы жизни, оба являются формами мирового древа или
   космического древа^[4], и изображаются в разных религиях и философиях как
   одно и то же дерево^[5].

Мифология и религия[править | править код]

   В фольклоре, мифах и художественной литературе упоминаются различные
   деревья жизни, часто связанные с бессмертием и плодородием.

  Шумеро-аккадская мифология[править | править код]

   В шумеро-аккадской мифологии Дерево жизни представлено серией узлов и
   перекрещивающихся линий^[6]^[7]. По всей видимости, важный религиозный
   символ, часто связанный с орлоголовыми богами и жрецами или царём.
   Ассириологи не смогли прийти к соглашению о значении этого символа.
   Название «Дерево Жизни» было отнесено к этому символу современными
   учёными; оно не использовалось ассирийскими источниками. По сути, нет
   никаких текстовых свидетельств, относящихся к этому символу. Изначально
   Дерево Жизни упомянуто в работе Симо Парполы «The Assyrian Tree of Life:
   Tracing the Origins of Jewish Monotheism and Greek Philosophy», однако
   позже были опубликованы статьи, как критикующие его мнение^[8], так и
   развивающие тему^[9]^[10]^[11].

  Древнеегипетская мифология[править | править код]

   В египетской мифологии и в эннеаде Гелиополиса первой парой являются Исида
   и Осирис (помимо Шу и Тефнут, а также Геб и Нут). Считалось, что они
   произошли от акациевого дерева Иусат, которое египтяне считали деревом
   жизни, называя «деревом, в котором жизнь и смерть объединены». В мифе
   говорится, что впоследствии Сет убил Осириса, положил его в гроб и сбросил
   в Нил, а гроб стал единым целым с корнями дерева тамариск^[12].

   Египетское священное дерево, сикомор, «стоит на пороге жизни и смерти,
   связывая два мира»^[13]^[14].

  Персидская мифология[править | править код]

   В персидской мифологии (до ислама) древо жизни описывается как огромное
   священное дерево, носящее на себе все семена. Дьявол (Ариман) создал
   лягушку, которая должна была взобраться на дерево и уничтожить его,
   надеясь помешать вырасти всем прочим деревьям на земле. В ответ Бог (Ахура
   Мазда) создал двух рыб наблюдать за лягушкой и охранять древо. Поскольку
   Ариман является ответственным за всё зло, включая смерть, а Ахура Мазда —
   за всё добро, концепция мирового древа в персидской мифологии очень близка
   к концепции Дерева Жизни.

  Китайская мифология[править | править код]

   В китайской мифологии изображение Дерева жизни включает в себя феникса и
   дракона; дракон часто представляет бессмертие^[15]. В даосских повестях на
   дереве жизни раз в три тысячи лет созревает персик. Тот, кто его съест,
   получает бессмертие^[16].

   В 1990 году в Саньсиндуе, в Сычуани (Китай), было сделано археологическое
   открытие — жертвенная яма, датированная XIII столетием до нашей эры. Она
   содержит три бронзовых дерева, одно из них 4 метра в высоту^[17]. В
   основании были дракон и фрукт, свисающий с нижней ветви. А сверху было
   помещено птицеподобное существо (феникс) с когтями. Также в Сычуани было
   найдено ещё одно дерево жизни, датированное поздней династией Хань.
   Керамическое основание охраняется рогатым зверем с крыльями. Вместо
   листьев у этого дерева монеты и люди. На вершине находится птица с
   монетами и солнцем.

  Армянская мифология[править | править код]

   В армянской мифологии Древо Жизни (Կենաց Ծառ) является религиозным
   символом, оно помещалось на стенах крепостей и броне воинов. Ветви дерева
   были равномерно распределены справа и слева от главного ствола; на каждой
   ветви рос один лист, и один лист на самой вершине дерева. По обе стороны
   от дерева изображались слуги, каждый протягивал одну руку к дереву, как
   будто они заботятся о нём^[18].

  Тюркская мифология[править | править код]

   Древо жизни — один из наиболее часто встречающихся мотивов в искусстве
   тюркских народов. Древо жизни является важным объектом тюркской культуры,
   упоминается и в тюркской мифологии.^[19]

   Среди многочисленных орнаментов, встречающихся на азербайджанских коврах,
   заметное место принадлежит сюжету «древа», который широко распространён в
   изобразительном искусстве Азербайджана. Вариацией «древа жизни» является
   символическое изображение «якоря», который по форме напоминает стрелу, а в
   гянджинских и карабахских коврах часто изображается фантастическое дерево
   Ваг-ваг. Изображение фантастического дерева Ваг-ваг часто встречается на
   тебризских и карабахских коврах. Плоды этого дерева, согласно мифологии,
   похожи на переговаривающиеся головы людей и животных, а листья утром
   раскрываются и вечером опадают. Со временем изображение дерева Ваг-ваг
   становится просто элементом орнамента, на ковре «Лям-па» оно помещено на
   концах «губпа», напоминающих птичьи головы^[20].

   Казахи называли древо жизни Байтерек. Корни этого дерева находятся в
   подземном мире, само дерево, его ствол — в земном, а крона — в небесном.

   Алтайские тюрки считают, что нижняя зона (корни древа) — мир душ предков,
   которых оберегает бог Эрлик вместе с подругой Тенгри-Умай. Эрлику
   подчиняется нижняя зона мира — духи предков, Эрлик является опорой Древа
   Жизни, придает ему импульс вечности. Благодаря ему происходит круговорот
   жизни в мире. 

   В языке крымских татар древо жизни имеет название «омюр агъач» (тур. Омюр
   — мир, вселенная, агъач — дерево) и дословно переводится как «мировое
   дерево». Для крымских татар символ древа также связан с жизнью рода и
   благополучия. Мотив древа жизни получил наибольшее распространение как
   элемент декора в вышивке одежды, а также предметов домашнего обихода.

   У малоазийских турок священными были сосна и можжевельник. Они считали,
   что люди связаны с деревьями, а дерево напрямую ассоциировалось с
   матерью-Богиней.

   Дерево в народной культуре и мифологии чувашей — объект поклонения. Аналог
   Древа жизни в традиционной чувашской народной культуре носит название
   киреме́т.

  Скандинавская мифология[править | править код]

   В скандинавской мифологии известен Иггдрасиль, Мировое Древо, массивное
   дерево (иногда — ясень или тис), с ним связано множество мифов.

  Славянская мифология[править | править код]

   Дерево жизни (ст.‑слав. и др.-рус. древо животьное) — в славянской
   народной традиции вариант мирового древа, в фольклоре — мотив, отражающий
   представления о библейском древе жизни, посаженном Богом среди рая.
   Фольклорный мотив отражает представление о мировом дереве, моделирующем
   мир («трёхугодливое дерево» славянских песен, где в кроне обитает соловей,
   в стволе — пчёлы, у корней — горностай)^[21].

  Иудаизм[править | править код]

   Подробнее см. Дерево жизни (Библия)

   В книге «Берешит» (Книга Бытия) древо жизни (ивр. עץ חיים‎ эц хаим) —
   дерево посреди райского сада, плоды которого дают вечную жизнь. Во время
   изгнания из рая после грехопадения Адам и Ева теряют доступ к этому
   дереву.

     И сказал Господь Бог: вот, Адам стал как один из Нас, зная добро и зло;
     и теперь как бы не простер он руки своей, и не взял также от дерева
     жизни, и не вкусил, и не стал жить вечно.(Быт. 3:22)

   В Книге притчей Соломоновых древом жизни названы Тора и мудрость: «Она —
   древо жизни для тех, которые приобретают её, — и блаженны, которые
   сохраняют её!» (Прит. 3:18), а также: «Кроткий язык — древо жизни, но
   необузданный — сокрушение духа» (Прит. 15:4).

   В «Книге Еноха» сказано, что во время великого суда всем, чьё имя есть в
   Книге Жизни, Бог даст плод с Дерева жизни.

   Эц Хаим часто используется как имя для иешив, синагог, для произведений
   раввинстической литературы, а также как название деревянных шестов, на
   которых намотан Свиток Торы.

  Каббала[править | править код]

   Подробнее см. Древо Жизни (каббала)

   В каббале Дерево жизни изображается десятью связанными элементами,
   представляя центральный символ каббалы. Это дерево представляет собой 10
   сфирот силы божественной реальности. Пантеистический и антропоморфный
   акцент этой эманационной теологии интерпретирует Тору, еврейские обряды и
   цели существования как символическую эзотерическую драму единения в
   сфирот, восстанавливая гармонию Творения. Со времён Ренессанса еврейская
   каббала является важной традицией в не-еврейской западной культуре,
   сначала через принятие христианской каббалой, а затем появившись в
   оккультной герметической Каббале. Эти адаптации иудейского дерева жизни
   синкретичны за счёт ассоциирования с другими религиозными традициями,
   эзотерическими теологиями и магическими практиками.

  Христианство[править | править код]

   См. также: Дерево жизни (Библия) и Дерево познания Добра и Зла

   В дополнение к Еврейской Библии дерево жизни символически описано в Книге
   Откровения как обладающее следующими свойствами: «И показал мне чистую
   реку воды жизни, светлую, как кристалл, исходящую от престола Бога и
   Агнца. Среди улицы его, и по ту и по другую сторону реки, древо жизни,
   двенадцать раз приносящее плоды, дающее на каждый месяц плод свой; и
   листья дерева — для исцеления народов» (Откр. 22:1–2).

   В католическом христианстве Дерево Жизни представляет собой безупречное
   состояние человечества, свободного от разложения и первородного греха, до
   грехопадения. Папа Бенедикт XVI сказал, что «крест является истинным
   древом жизни»^[22]. Святой Бонавентура учил, что лечебный плод с Дерева
   Жизни представляет Иисуса Христа^[23]. В свою очередь святой Альберт
   Великий учил, что евхаристия, тело и плоть Христова, является плодом с
   дерева жизни^[24].

   В восточном христианстве дерево жизни представляет собой любовь Бога. Св.
   Исаак Сирин говорил, что «Рай есть любовь Божия, в которой наслаждение
   всеми блаженствами», и что «древо жизни есть любовь Божия»^[25].

Наука[править | править код]

   См. также: Филогенетическое дерево

   Дерево жизни также является метафорой, описывающей отношение друг к другу
   всей жизни на Земле в контексте эволюции^[26]. Чарльз Дарвин говорил о
   видении эволюции, как «извилистого берега», в «Происхождении видов».
   Однако единственная иллюстрация представляет собой ветвящуюся диаграмму,
   похожую на дерево.

     От первого роста дерева отделяется множество ветвей, которые потом
     разрушаются и опадают; и эти опавшие ветви представляют собой целые
     порядки, семьи и поколения, которые теперь не живут, и о которых
     известно лишь по ископаемым и окаменелостям. Когда мы там, мы видим
     тонкую, упорно растущую веточку, растущую из разветвления дерева внизу,
     которая всё ещё жива. Иногда мы видим животных, вроде Орниторинкус
     (Утконос), или Лепидосирен (Американский чешуйчатник), которые в малой
     степени связаны со своими более крупными ветвями жизни, и которые, по
     всей видимости, избежали смертельной конкуренции за счёт населения
     защищённой станции. По мере того, как почки растут, и, если пригодны,
     вырастают в ветви и перекрывают более слабые ветви, и так за поколением
     поколение; я верю, что это великое Древо Жизни, которое наполняет
     мёртвые и сломанные ветви корой земли, и покрывает поверхность своим всё
     время растущими и красивым ветвлением.

     — Чарльз Дарвин, «Происхождение видов»^[27]

В культуре[править | править код]

   В мире существуют скульптурные композиции, посвящённые Древу жизни. Одна
   из них находится в России.

   [IMG]Памятник «Дерево жизни», Ростов-на-Дону, Россия [IMG]Кельтское дерево
   жизни Джен Делис.

   В «Dictionaire Mytho-Hermetique», книге известного алхимика Антуана-Жозефа
   Пернети Дерево Жизни ассоциируется с эликсиром жизни и философским камнем.

   Современная валлийская художница Джен Делис создала кельтский символ
   Дерева Жизни, основанный на культе почитания деревьев древних кельтов и
   традиционных изображениях кельтов^[28]^[29].

   В книге «Eden in the East» (1998) Стивен Оппенгеймер предполагает, что
   традиция поклонения деревьям происходит из Индонезии и распространилась в
   ходе событий около 8000 года до нашей эры, получивших название «Younger
   Dryas», когда поднялся уровень моря. Эта традиция достигла Китая
   (провинция Сычуань), затем Индии и Ближнего Востока. Наконец,
   финно-угорская ветвь этой религии распространилась через Россию в
   Финляндию, где дала начало скандинавскому мифу об Иггдрасиле.

   По последним данным, восемь человек погибли и 29 человек пострадали из-за
   урагана на озере Яльчик в Республике Марий Эл, сообщает РИА Новости
   со ссылкой на МЧС России. Из-за урагана госпитализированы 16 человек. Мэр
   Йошкар-Олы Евгений Маслов заявил, что двое пострадавших находятся
   в тяжелом состоянии.

   На озере Яльчик деревья упали на палаточный лагерь, который стоял на диком
   пляже, заявил глава Марий Эл Юрий Зайцев. По его словам, среди погибших —
   трое детей. Туристическая группа не была зарегистрирована в спасательных
   службах, заявили в МЧС.

   В туристическом лагере на берегу озера Яльчик, как пишет «Подъем»
   со ссылкой на спасателей, в момент происшествия находилось до 500
   автомобилей. После начала урагана многие люди попытались выехать из леса,
   но упавшие деревья перегородили дорогу. По словам очевидцев, женщин
   и детей из палаток отводили ближе к берегу озера, чтобы они не попали под
   падающие деревья.

   Следственный комитет РФ уточнил, что озера Малый Яльчик и Большой Яльчик,
   где упали деревья, расположены на территории национального парка «Марий
   Чодра». Управление СК по Марий Эл возбудило уголовное дело «по факту
   оказания руководством ФГБУ «Национальный парк «Марий Чодра» услуг,
   не отвечающих требованиям безопасности», что привело к гибели людей (часть
   3 статьи 238 УК). 

   Вечером 29 июля ураган прошел в восьми регионах Приволжского федерального
   округа, в том числе в Марий Эл. Порывы ветра достигали 27 метров
   в секунду. В 520 населенных пунктах с населением почти 100 тысяч человек
   упало более 550 деревьев, повреждены крыши 41 жилого дома и семи
   социальных объектов, сообщили в МЧС. По данным ведомства на 7:32 утра,

   истории

На Берлинале в этом году как никогда много анимации Новый Макото Синкай (главный
  преемник Миядзаки), мультфильм о войне в Иране и история о будущем, где люди
                         обязаны превращаться в деревья

   Berlinale

   В 2023 году Берлинский фестиваль уделил непривычно много внимания
   анимации. В основной конкурс включены сразу два полнометражных
   мультфильма, оба из Азии — «Судзумэ закрывает двери» японца Макото Синкая
   и «Студенческий городок» китайца Лю Цзяня. В конкурс Encounters включена
   венгерская научная фантастика «Белое пластиковое небо», в «Панораму» —
   антивоенная иранская «Сирена». Все эти картины роднит исследование
   прошлого, отзывающегося в настоящем, и попытки предсказать отнюдь
   не светлое будущее. 

  «Сирена»

   The Siren. Режиссер — Сепиде Фарси. Франция

   Берлинале принципиально отказался в этом году приглашать фильмы из Ирана,
   снятые при государственном участии (например, именно таким был один
   из лауреатов «Золотого медведя» за последние годы — «Развод Надера
   и Симин» Асгара Фархади). Зато анимационной «Сирене», сделанной
   эмигранткой из Ирана Сепиде Фарси во Франции, доверили открытие программы
   «Панорама».

  Почему Берлинале игнорирует Иран

     * «Мы хотим забрать нашу страну у этих странных и тупых людей» Репортаж
       «Медузы» из Ирана. Сотни тысяч людей несколько месяцев протестовали
       против авторитарного режима, но так и не смогли победить — по крайней
       мере пока

   Сюжет связан с ирано-иракской войной, темой болезненной, табуированной
   и жестко контролируемой цензурой — в частности, в Иране невозможно
   распространение каких-либо ее съемок, если они не санкционированы
   государством. Многие именитые режиссеры, в том числе Джафар Панахи,
   пытались снять игровые фильмы об этой войне, но не смогли получить
   разрешения. 

   Фарси была девочкой, когда в 1980-м, всего через год после революции,
   начались военные действия. Отец режиссера умер в 2022-м, фильм посвящен
   его памяти. В детстве, после окончания войны, он возил ее в город Абадан —
   южный порт, фактически уничтоженный тогда иракской авиацией и артиллерией.
   Теперь постановщица «Сирены» в своем фильме одновременно отдает дань
   прошлому и выражает протест против официозной лжи. Анимация, к которой
   Фарси — автор игровых и документальных картин — прибегает впервые в жизни,
   помогает ей обойти нехватку материала: если его невозможно добыть,
   придется нарисовать. Схожим образом поступала со своими воспоминаниями
   Маржан Сатрапи, когда делала знаменитый «Персеполис».

   Berlinale — Berlin International Film Festival

   Невозможно игнорировать и еще один аспект, пусть не запланированный
   авторами. Картина о подростках, играющих в футбол на пустыре, которых
   внезапно прерывает бомбардировка жилых кварталов, отзывается свежими
   впечатлениями о событиях в Украине. Стойкость и находчивость 14-летнего
   Омида, главного героя «Сирены», напоминает о десятках подлинных историй,
   случившихся вовсе не 40 с лишним лет назад, а в последние месяцы. Фильм
   Фарси говорит с сегодняшним днем, используя прошлое лишь в качестве
   инструмента.

   Поэтичная ткань «Сирены» сложена из многослойных визуальных образов
   (художник и соавтор — Завен Наджар) и сновидческих джазовых мелодий
   французского трубача Эрика Трюффаза, что не мешает картине быть еще
   и увлекательным триллером.

   Подросток после бегства матери с младшими детьми остался в Абадане
   с дедушкой и ждет с фронта старшего брата. Развозя на своем мотоцикле
   горячие обеды буквально под пулями, Омид мечтает заработать на петушиных
   боях, для чего тренирует своего петуха Шир Хана. Знакомство с несколькими
   необычными людьми — знаменитой дивой, которой после революции запрещены
   публичные выступления, старым инженером, живущим в окружении котов,
   запершимся в своем ателье фотографом, священниками из армянской церкви —
   убеждает мальчика, что отдавать «патриотический долг», погибая
   на бессмысленной войне, вовсе не обязательно. Ему в голову приходит
   невероятная идея: отремонтировать старый корабль пропавшего когда-то
   в море отца (это судно и называется «Сирена»), чтобы вывезти
   из обреченного города всех, кто ему дорог, людей и животных. Его личный
   Ноев ковчег. 

   Антивоенный и наполненный стоическим оптимизмом мультфильм Фарси — еще
   и тонкий роман воспитания о первой любви и умении совершить выбор
   в невыносимо тяжелых обстоятельствах. 

  «Белое пластиковое небо»

   White Plastic Sky. Режиссер — Тибор Баноцки и Шаролта Сабо. Венгрия

   «Сирена» погружает в прошлое, «Белое пластиковое небо» — в далекое
   будущее, на сто лет вперед. Соавторы и партнеры, лауреаты множества
   фестивалей короткометражной анимации, Тибор Баноцки и Шаролта Сабо для
   своего полнометражного дебюта взяли за основу худший из возможных
   сценариев для человечества. В их Будапеште 2123 года не осталось
   ни животных, ни растений, почва отравлена, а немногочисленные люди
   вынуждены жить под гигантским куполом — то самое «белое пластиковое небо»
   из названия.

   Кормиться давно нечем, поэтому введен новый закон: дожив до 50 лет, каждый
   человек отдает свое тело обществу. Ученые вживляют в человека особенный
   имплант — выращивают из него дерево, которое используется для питания
   остальными. Все эти детали зрителю сообщают постепенно и ненавязчиво,
   поскольку основной стержень интриги — не социально-политический,
   а романтический. 

   Психолог Штефан всю жизнь убеждает своих пациентов в необходимости
   самопожертвования на благо остальных. Однако, когда его жена Нора, которая
   не в состоянии пережить боль от потери их сына, решает досрочно
   превратиться в дерево, Штефан совершает невозможное. Добыв фальшивые
   документы и проникнув на плантацию, где выращивается питание для выживших,
   он похищает погруженную в сон Нору и отправляется с ней в путешествие —
   на поиск спрятанной в далеких горах лаборатории. Говорят, живущий в ней
   профессор, когда-то и разработавший спасительную схему, способен провести
   сложную операцию и извлечь из обреченного убийственный имплант. 

   IFrame
   Berlinale — Berlin International Film Festival

   Баноцки и Сабо используют различные техники, пытаясь найти в каждой
   из своих экзистенциальных, порой близких к абстракции притч адекватный
   сюжету визуальный язык. В «Белом пластиковом небе» это ротоскопирование —
   Штефан и Нора сыграны живыми актерами, потом обведены и анимированы
   режиссерами (они же продюсеры, сценаристы, художники картины). Возникает
   жутковатый эффект сочетания реалистических героев с кошмарно-безжизненными
   пейзажами придуманного будущего, обладающими грозной красотой забывшей
   о человеке природы. Эстетика мультфильма временами напоминает анимационную
   фантастику восьмидесятых — «Властелинов времени» Рене Лалу или «Навсикаю
   из Долины ветров» Хаяо Миядзаки. Но содержательно и эмоционально «Белое
   пластиковое небо» отражает страхи именно сегодняшние. 

     Внимание! В следующем абзаце — спойлер к финалу «Белого пластикового
     неба».

   Финал может показаться светлым лишь радикальным «зеленым». Штефан и Нора,
   будто новые Адам и Ева, соединяются с древом познания добра и зла, чтобы
   раздеться донага и раствориться в окружающей среде без остатка. Инверсия
   мифа об Эдеме не оставляет ни одной надежды. 

  «Судзумэ закрывает двери»

   Suzume no tojimari. Режиссер — Макото Синкай. Япония

   Феномен японского проката — больше 10 миллионов зрителей только на родине,
   а ведь показы в других странах еще даже не начались. Это новое
   подростковое фэнтези Макото Синкая знаменует окончательное наступление
   творческой зрелости, ощутимое уже в «Твоем имени» и в «Дитя погоды».
   «Судзумэ закрывает двери» — с большим отрывом самый коммерческий фильм
   конкурса Берлинале, но отнюдь не самый поверхностный и ничуть
   не банальный. 

   Синкай по-прежнему виртуозно сочетает тинейджерские сказочные сюжеты
   с экологически-катастрофической повесткой, столь волнующей японских
   зрителей, а фотореализм узнаваемых городских пейзажей подкрашивает
   сюрреалистическими цветами. Его новая героиня Судзумэ — 17-летняя сирота,
   обретающая таинственный (как выясняется впоследствии, предопределенный
   ее сиротством) дар: она способна видеть прорехи в ткани бытия, через
   которые на Землю рвутся стихийные бедствия — черви-разрушители, — и,
   находя таинственные двери и закрывая их, предотвращать землетрясения
   и иные катаклизмы.

   Эсхатологический размах никак не препятствует ни трогательной истории
   первой любви, ни взявшемуся ниоткуда милому говорящему котику (конечно же,
   в нем живет синтоистский дух, сдерживающий гнев природы и защищающий
   людей), ни закадровой нежной музыке. Лучшая сюрреалистическая деталь
   мультфильма — трехногий детский стульчик, ходячий и говорящий: это
   сообщник, друг и чуть ли не возлюбленный Судзумэ, сопровождающий
   ее во всех приключениях. 

   IFrame

   «Судзумэ закрывает двери» вновь заставит многих сравнивать Синкая
   со старшим товарищем и духовным наставником — великим Хаяо Миядзаки, чей
   новый мультфильм тоже должен выйти в 2023 году. Синкай без стеснения
   цитирует мастера, начиная действие в префектуре Миядзаки и заставляя свою
   героиню зависнуть в воздухе, как Ситу из «Небесного замка Лапута». Однако
   у Синкая собственный язык, стиль и узнаваемая индивидуальная манера.
   Одновременно очень японская и совершенно универсальная — особенно в мире,
   который постоянно трясет и где каждый ощущает себя на краю пропасти. Это
   ощущение анимация Макото Синкая передает чрезвычайно точно, что делает его
   эффектный мультфильм еще и крайне актуальным. 

  «Студенческий городок»

   Da xue cheng. Режиссер — Лю Цзянь. Китай

   Лю Цзянь — единственный режиссер, снимающий в Китае независимое
   анимационное кино, обращенное исключительно ко взрослому зрителю.
   Неформальный лидер китайского авторского кино Цзя Чжанкэ — кстати,
   озвучивший здесь важную роль художника-эмигранта, вернувшегося
   на родину, — небезосновательно считает коллегу гением.

   «Студенческий городок» — третий полный метр Лю, и он радикально отличается
   от двух предыдущих, отмеченных влиянием американского криминального кино
   и саркастического постмодернизма. Это поэтичная, нежная, парадоксальная
   и очевидно автобиографическая мемуаристика о годах юности режиссера,
   проведенных в художественном вузе в девяностых. Недаром картине предпослан
   эпиграф из «Портрета художника в юности» Джеймса Джойса. 

   Среди других имен и персон, обсуждаемых героями фильма — первым поколением
   китайских студентов, получивших доступ к капиталистической цивилизации
   Запада и страстно увлеченных ею, — Дюшан и Кобейн, Сартр и Дебюсси, Ротко
   и Ван Гог, Бетховен и Коппола. Будни молодых людей, пока застенчивых
   и неотесанных, но уже полных амбиций, состоят из предсказуемой рутины: они
   пьют пиво, прогуливают лекции, плюют в потолок, влюбляются,
   разочаровываются, строят невероятные планы на будущее. Одна девочка
   мечтает петь в опере, но пока устраивается в местный бар — ведь там
   неплохо платят. Другая собирается начать карьеру пианистки, но сперва
   выйти замуж за студента из престижного института — ведь он вскоре
   переезжает в Париж. Парень с художественного факультета пытается
   преодолеть в себе традиционалиста и найти новую форму для китайской
   классической живописи — туши на бумаге. А другой, специализирующийся
   на живописи маслом, увлечен недоступной девушкой со своего курса.

   Фрагментарное мозаичное повествование складывается в масштабную,
   но в то же время камерную и интимную фреску о девяностых — эпохе транзита
   из прошлого в будущее, отказа от обветшавших иллюзий во имя неоправданных
   надежд. Точно такой же фильм можно было бы снять о поколении молодежи
   девяностых в постсоветской России, только никто этого пока не сделал.

   С любовью и вниманием к деталям, суховатым юмором и внезапными проблесками
   сновидческой фантазии Лю Цзянь по-прустовски пристально вглядывается
   в ушедшее время. Как можно его восстановить? Выясняется, что на это
   способна именно анимация. Достичь такого уровня правдоподобия
   и одновременно абстракции в игровом кино вряд ли возможно. 

   IFrame
   China Underground

   Как замечает один из персонажей, живопись превосходит фотографию — ведь
   лишь она способна ухватить и передать скрытую суть вещей. Именно таков
   мультфильм Лю, в котором даже безлюдные пейзажи с обшарпанными стенами
   домов, палой листвой или ползущими по траве насекомыми будто бы наполнены
   глубокой эмоцией и специфически восточной созерцательностью. 

   Из вороха житейских неурядиц и проходных эпизодов вырастают вопросы, над
   которыми ломают головы герои: как достигнуть подлинной свободы, кто имеет
   право назвать себя художником, кому судить о таланте, какое все это имеет
   отношение к успеху и деньгам? И главное, что такое искусство?
   Исчерпывающий ответ на этот вопрос Лю Цзянь дает своим выдающимся фильмом.
   И это — лучший аргумент в пользу участия анимации в международных
   фестивалях, по-прежнему достаточно редкого.

   МОСКВА, 31 октября/ Радио Sputnik. Более четырех тысяч деревьев украсят 12
   столичных магистралей, сообщил мэр Москвы Сергей Собянин.Больше половины
   из них – липы. Деревья красивые и неприхотливые, устойчивые к морозам и
   другим особенностям климата Москвы, отметил градоначальник в личном
   блоге."Хорошо зарекомендовали себя и вязы. Этих благородных деревьев
   планируем высадить порядка 850 штук. А декоративные яблони прекрасны в
   любое время года. Их тоже будет довольно много – почти 450", – цитирует
   Собянина телеканал "Москва 24".Радио Sputnik также сообщало, что в Беговом
   районе Москвы появится новый современный квартал.Такого Telegram-канала,
   как у нас, нет ни у кого. Он для тех, кто хочет делать выводы сам.

   МОСКВА, 31 октября/ Радио Sputnik. Более четырех тысяч деревьев украсят 12
   столичных магистралей, сообщил мэр Москвы Сергей Собянин.
   Больше половины из них – липы. Деревья красивые и неприхотливые,
   устойчивые к морозам и другим особенностям климата Москвы, отметил
   градоначальник в личном блоге.
   «
   "Хорошо зарекомендовали себя и вязы. Этих благородных деревьев планируем
   высадить порядка 850 штук. А декоративные яблони прекрасны в любое время
   года. Их тоже будет довольно много – почти 450", – цитирует Собянина
   телеканал "Москва 24".
   Радио Sputnik также сообщало, что в Беговом районе Москвы появится новый
   современный квартал.

   Это была реальная душераздирающая история о человеке, потерявшем сына в
   результате нападения ХАМАС. Но старый маразматик умудрился даже трагедией
   вызвать у публики усмешки. В общем, размялся перед встречей с коллегой по
   цеху разговорного жанра.
