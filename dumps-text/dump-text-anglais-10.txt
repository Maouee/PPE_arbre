   Tree Equity Score
   Ensuring tree cover in cities is equitably distributed

   Using Data Tools to Create Tree Equity

   The story is the same in nearly every city across the United States. With
   few exceptions, trees are sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged and
   neighborhoods of color and more prominent in wealthier, whiter
   neighborhoods. Redlining policies, dating back to the 1930s, helped
   lay the groundwork for this inequity.

   American Forests is focused on addressing this inequity by focusing
   resources in neighborhoods of highest need. It’s our moral imperative to
   do so, given how many life-saving and quality of life benefits trees
   provide people. That is why we are working to create Tree Equity, which is
   about ensuring that all people experience the benefits of trees. One of
   the ways we are doing this is with our Tree Equity Score tool. It provides
   a social-equity-focused narrative, goals and a guide path for building
   understanding, commitment and action around Tree Equity. It is also free
   and easy to access.

Where is Tree Equity Score Available?

   Tree Equity Score covers all urban areas in United States, including
   Hawai’i and Alaska. 80% of the population lives in urban areas, which
   means over 260 million people can find a score for their neighborhood.

   See Your City's Tree Equity Score
   What Do the Scores Mean?
   Each score indicates whether there are enough trees in a neighborhood for
   everyone to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that
   trees provide. Scores are based on tree canopy, surface temperature,
   income, employment, race, age, language and health factors. A
   0-to-100-point system makes it easy to understand how a community fares.

Who Can Use Tree Equity Score?

   Tree Equity Score can be used by neighborhood organizations,
   U.S. congressional leaders and everybody in between. And it can be used by
   a variety of sectors, such as urban forestry and public health, given the
   role trees play in slowing climate change and improving health and
   wellbeing. Some of the uses are:

   Advocacy
   Make the case for federal, state and local policies, programs and funding
   related to protecting existing trees and planting new trees. The Tucson
   City Council used the methodology from Tree Equity Score to create a
   mapping tool for making decisions about how to invest in green
   infrastructure, such as tree planting and green stormwater basin
   installations.
   City Planning
   Urban land-use planners and others can use the scores to decide where and
   how to invest in forestry and infrastructure. The Tucson City Council and
   Mayor Regina Romero agreed in April 2021 to adopt the Tucson Tree Equity
   Score as the primary tool to prioritize investments for the city’s urban
   forestry initiative and infrastructure projects.
   Forestry Programs
   Use the scores to take a fresh look at an existing urban forestry program.
   Does the program prioritize planting trees in low-scoring neighborhoods?
   Scores can help track progress related to urban forestry programs and
   initiatives.
