            Tree Trimming, Removal Project To Slow Traffic On US 97A

   Motorists in the Chelan area will encounter the unusual sight of orange on
   the roadway in the wintertime next week.

   The Washington State Department of Transportation (DOT) is partnering with
   the Chelan County PUD for a tree thinning and removal project on U.S.
   Highway 97A just west of the Dan Gordon Bridge.

   "We will be providing traffic control for the PUD's arborist team," says
   DOT spokesperson, Lauren Loebsack. "Drivers can expect some traffic delays
   and some intermittent closures of the Riverwalk Trail through that area
   while the work is going on."

   Loebsack adds that while projects involving the DOT are rare during the
   winter months, the one in Chelan is happening at an ideal time of the
   year.

   "Trimming trees in the winter is probably the preferred time when they are
   dormant, and the removal of trees of trees is also better because there
   won't be as much material to clean up since there aren't as many leaves on
   the trees. This work will also be weather dependent, so if it does end up
   raining or snowing that day we're going to need to bump that work down the
   road a bit."

   The project is scheduled to happen on Tuesday, Jan. 9 from 8:30 a.m. to
   3:30 p.m.
