                                What is a Tree?

   by Michael Kuhns, Extension Forestry Specialist

   What is a tree? How are trees different from grasses, sunflowers,
   dandelions, and other types of plants? And what do trees have in common
   with shrubs and woody vines? The answers to these questions seem obvious
   at first. But unless you are a botanist you may find that the answers
   don't come easily. Let's look a little closer to find some common
   characteristics of trees, shrubs, and woody vines.

   Trees, shrubs, and vines belong to many different plant families. Some are
   closely related, like ponderosa pine and limber pine. Others are not
   closely related at all, like eastern red cedar and silver maple. However,
   trees, shrubs, and vines all have one thing that separates them from the
   rest of the plant world: a woody stem that is perennial or that lives for
   many years. Grasses and certain other plants may be perennial, but their
   tops are regrown year after year from rhizomes, bulbs, or other organs
   found at or just under the soil surface.

   Let's look at each of the parts of a woody plant's stem and see how they
   are put together and how they grow larger year after year. If you could
   tunnel into a woody plant's stem, whether the trunk of a tree or a twig on
   a shrub, you would first encounter bark, then cambium, and finally wood or
   xylem. Bark is the outer covering on the trunk, twigs, and woody roots.
   The outer bark we are familiar with is a layer of dead corky cells
   protecting the rest of the stem. The inner bark, or phloem, is a live
   spongy layer just inside the outer bark that moves sugars and other
   substances from the leaves to the stem, roots, and other places where they
   are needed. Inner bark eventually grows out to form part of the outer
   bark.

   New bark is constantly being made on the inside and pushed out. This is
   why older trunks usually have rough outer bark that peels or flakes away.
   Bark is highly variable, though. Young trees of most species have fairly
   smooth bark. To see what a tree's bark looked like when it was young, look
   at the young bark on upper branches and twigs.

   White Oak Cross section

   Cross section of white oak tree trunk:

   (A) outer bark (dry dead tissue)
   (B) inner bark (living tissue)
   (C) cambium
   (D) sapwood
   (E) heartwood
   (F) pith
   (G) wood rays.

   Just inside the bark, but outside the wood, is a single layer of cells
   called the cambium. This layer repeatedly divides, first in then out, to
   form all of the new wood and bark. Wood, or xylem, makes up everything
   inside the cambium on tree trunks, branches, twigs, and woody roots. Wood
   is made up of fibers for strength and hollow tubes of different sizes.
   These tubes are like straws that conduct water from the roots to the
   leaves. These tubes and fibers, as well as other types of cells, are
   packed tightly together to make the wood inside a woody plant.

   As woody plants grow in diameter a new layer of wood is produced each year
   by the cambium. This layer is called an annual ring or growth ring. The
   rings in the center of a trunk or twig are the oldest and those near the
   outside are younger. Wide rings usually indicate good growth conditions
   for that year and narrow rings indicate poor growing conditions.

   As a stem ages and grows, eventually some of the wood in the center is not
   needed for water movement. This wood dies one ring at a time and becomes
   heartwood. Heartwood often is filled with dark colored substances that
   help it resist decay, as in red cedar's red to purple heartwood. The
   active living wood on the outside of the stem, one to many rings wide, is
   called the sapwood. It is usually lighter in color than heartwood. Sapwood
   is responsible for all water and mineral movement through the stem.

   Ponderosa PineMost people would agree that this ponderosa pine is a tree,
   but...

   Canyon Maple tree...the canyon maple and Utah junipers in this picture
   might be considered shrubs. Given enough time to grow, all of them should
   meet the definition of a tree.

   So trees, shrubs, and woody vines all have woody, perennial stems. What
   makes them different from one another? The distinction between trees and
   shrubs is not always clear. We all know that a large cottonwood is a tree
   and a creeping juniper is a shrub, but there are many shrub-like trees and
   tree-like shrubs. Though no scientific definition exists to separate trees
   and shrubs, a useful definition for a tree is a woody plant having one
   erect perennial stem (trunk) at least three inches in diameter at a point
   4-1/2 feet above the ground, a definitely formed crown of foliage, and a
   mature height of at least 13 feet. This definition works fine, though some
   trees may have more than one stem and young trees obviously don't meet the
   size criteria. A shrub can then be defined as a woody plant with several
   perennial stems that may be erect or may lay close to the ground. It will
   usually have a height less than 13 feet and stems no more than about three
   inches in diameter.

   Woody vines are plants that have perennial stems that cannot support
   themselves. Vines use other plants or objects to rise above the ground or
   they lie along the ground. Vines attach themselves to other objects with
   tendrils or by twining. Though woody vines have perennial stems, these
   stems rarely get very large in diameter.

   Trees, shrubs, and woody vines can be classified as deciduous or
   evergreen. If a plant's leaves stay green and alive through the winter it
   is called an evergreen. Examples found in Utah are pines, spruces, and
   junipers. Plants whose leaves die in autumn and fall off, such as elms,
   maples, and ashes, are called deciduous. In Utah nearly all evergreen
   woody plants have needle-like or scaly leaves and most deciduous woody
   plants have broad leaves. All vines commonly found in Utah have broad
   leaves and are deciduous.
