                              Tree Data Structure                             
                                                                              
   We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and   
   queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The   
   different data structures are used for different kinds of data.            
                                                                              
   Some factors are considered for choosing the data structure:               
                                                                              
     * What type of data needs to be stored?: It might be a possibility that  
       a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data.    
     * Cost of operations: If we want to minimize the cost for the operations 
       for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a   
       simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we 
       can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to    
       perform the binary search. The binary search works very fast for the   
       simple list as it divides the search space into half.                  
     * Memory usage: Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less   
       memory.                                                                
                                                                              
   A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical      
   data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the     
   hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:               
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above tree shows the organization hierarchy of some company. In the    
   above structure, john is the CEO of the company, and John has two direct   
   reports named as Steve and Rohan. Steve has three direct reports named     
   Lee, Bob, Ella where Steve is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named  
   Sal and Emma. Emma has two direct reports named Tom and Raj. Tom has one   
   direct report named Bill. This particular logical structure is known as a  
   Tree. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a Tree. In 
   this structure, the root is at the top, and its branches are moving in a   
   downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is  
   an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.                
                                                                              
   Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.               
                                                                              
     * A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or         
       entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or       
       simulate hierarchy.                                                    
     * A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does   
       not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as    
       elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.                    
     * In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node.  
       Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the      
       above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so   
       the type of data would be a string.                                    
     * Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes  
       that can be called children.                                           
                                                                              
   Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.                              
                                                                              
   Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:                   
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   In the above structure, each node is labeled with some number. Each arrow  
   shown in the above figure is known as a link between the two nodes.        
                                                                              
     * Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In      
       other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In 
       the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If  
       a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a     
       parent-child relationship.                                             
     * Child node: If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is  
       known as a child node.                                                 
     * Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to   
       be the parent of that sub-node.                                        
     * Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.    
     * Leaf Node:- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node,   
       is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the      
       tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. 
       Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.                          
     * Internal nodes: A node has atleast one child node known as an internal 
     * Ancestor node:- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a     
       path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any        
       ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are 
       the ancestors of node 10.                                              
     * Descendant: The immediate successor of the given node is known as a    
       descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of     
       node 5.                                                                
                                                                              
     Properties of Tree data structure                                        
                                                                              
     * Recursive data structure: The tree is also known as a recursive data   
       structure. A tree can be defined as recursively because the            
       distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a root node.   
       The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its      
       subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below   
       figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left      
       subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different    
       colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner.   
       So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented  
       in various applications.                                               
       Tree                                                                   
     * Number of edges: If there are n nodes, then there would n-1 edges.     
       Each arrow in the structure represents the link or path. Each node,    
       except the root node, will have atleast one incoming link known as an  
       edge. There would be one link for the parent-child relationship.       
     * Depth of node x: The depth of node x can be defined as the length of   
       the path from the root to the node x. One edge contributes one-unit    
       length in the path. So, the depth of node x can also be defined as the 
       number of edges between the root node and the node x. The root node    
       has 0 depth.                                                           
     * Height of node x: The height of node x can be defined as the longest   
       path from the node x to the leaf node.                                 
                                                                              
   Based on the properties of the Tree data structure, trees are classified   
   into various categories.                                                   
                                                                              
     Implementation of Tree                                                   
                                                                              
   The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically   
   with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented   
   as shown below:                                                            
                                                                              
   Tree                                                                       
                                                                              
   The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in    
   the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The    
   second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the    
   left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.     
                                                                              
   In programming, the structure of a node can be defined as:                 
                                                                              
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
   _________________________________________                                  
                                                                              
   The above structure can only be defined for the binary trees because the   
   binary tree can have utmost two children, and generic trees can have more  
   than two children. The structure of the node for generic trees would be    
   different as compared to the binary tree.                                  
                                                                              
     Applications of trees                                                    
                                                                              
   The following are the applications of trees:                               
                                                                              
     * Storing naturally hierarchical data: Trees are used to store the data  
       in the hierarchical structure. For example, the file system. The file  
       system stored on the disc drive, the file and folder are in the form   
       of the naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees.    
     * Organize data: It is used to organize data for efficient insertion,    
       deletion and searching. For example, a binary tree has a logN time for 
       searching an element.                                                  
     * Trie: It is a special kind of tree that is used to store the           
       dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking. 
     * Heap: It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is 
       used to implement priority queues.                                     
     * B-Tree and B+Tree: B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used 
       to implement indexing in databases.                                    
     * Routing table: The tree data structure is also used to store the data  
       in routing tables in the routers.                                      
                                                                              
     Types of Tree data structure                                             
                                                                              
   The following are the types of a tree data structure:                      
                                                                              
     * General tree: The general tree is one of the types of tree data        
       structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n  
       number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the  
       node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node   
       in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent  
       node are known as subtrees.                                            
       Tree                                                                   
       There can be n number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general    
       tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be 
       ordered.                                                               
       Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are          
       connected to the nodes known as child nodes. The root node is labeled  
       with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as         
       siblings.                                                              
     * Binary tree: Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0    
       and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child 
       nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2    
       nodes.                                                                 
       Tree

     * Binary Search tree: Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure  
       in which one node is connected to n number of nodes. It is a           
       node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary       
       search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and        
       right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in  
       a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child    
       and right child pointer).                                              
       Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the      
       value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right        
       subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.                
                                                                              
   A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as   
   struct, as shown below:

   The above is the node structure with three fields: data field, the second  
   field is the left pointer of the node type, and the third field is the     
   right pointer of the node type.

     * AVL tree                                                               
                                                                              
   It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a      
   variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the  
   binary tree as well as of the binary search tree. It is a self-balancing   
   binary search tree that was invented by Adelson Velsky Lindas. Here,       
   self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right  
   subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the balancing factor.      
                                                                              
   We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search  
   tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as 
   the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of    
   the right subtree. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or   
   1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the       
   balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.

   https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree                                        
                                                                              
     * Red-Black Tree                                                         
                                                                              
   The red-Black tree is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the      
   Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a   
   binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the  
   value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater   
   than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary 
   search in the average case is log_2n, the best case is O(1), and the worst 
   case is O(n).                                                              
                                                                              
   When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be        
   balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion,   
   etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time          
   complexity of log_2n.                                                      
                                                                              
   The red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is     
   also a height balancing binary search tree then why do we require a        
   Red-Black tree. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would   
   be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 
   rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that 
   represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing 
   of the tree.                                                               
                                                                              
     * Splay tree                                                             
                                                                              
   The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently 
   accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some 
   rotation operations. Here, splaying means the recently accessed node. It   
   is a self-balancing binary search tree having no explicit balance          
   condition like AVL tree.                                                   
                                                                              
   It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced,   
   i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the           
   operations in splay tree takes order of logN time where n is the number of 
   nodes.                                                                     
                                                                              
   Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height      
   balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which    
   leads to a balanced tree.                                                  
                                                                              
     * Treap                                                                  
                                                                              
   Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it    
   comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary  
   search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the  
   value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or 
   greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both      
   right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we   
   can say that the root node contains the lowest value.                      
                                                                              
   In treap data structure, each node has both key and priority where key is  
   derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap  
   data structure.                                                            
                                                                              
   The Treap data structure follows two properties which are given below:     
                                                                              
     * Right child of a node>=current node and left child of a node <=current 
       node (binary tree)                                                     
     * Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap)           
     * B-tree                                                                 
                                                                              
   B-tree is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree.     
   Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have  
   more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the       
   sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at      
   different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same    
   level.                                                                     
                                                                              
   If order is m then node has the following properties:                      
                                                                              
     * Each node in a b-tree can have maximum m children                      
     * For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has        
       minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2        
       children. For example, the value of m is 5 which means that a node can 
       have 5 children and internal nodes can contain maximum 3 children.     
     * Each node has maximum (m-1) keys.                                      
                                                                              
   The root node must contain minimum 1 key and all other nodes must contain  
   atleast ceiling of m/2 minus 1 keys.
