   SAUK CENTRE (WJON News) -- Two people were taken to the hospital when the
   pickup they were in collided with a tree.

   The Minnesota State Patrol says the incident happened at about 1:00 a.m.
   Friday near Sauk Centre.

   Twenty-four-year-old Joshua Pena of Brownsville, Texas was driving north
   on Highway 71 when the pickup went into the ditch and hit the tree.

   Pena and his passenger, 24-year-old Ruiz Sebastian of Brownsville, Texas,
   were both taken to Sauk Centre Hospital with non-life-threatening
   injuries.
