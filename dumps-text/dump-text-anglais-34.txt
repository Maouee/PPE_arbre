   In mathematics, Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees
   over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under
   homeomorphic embedding.

History[edit]

   The theorem was conjectured by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved by Joseph
   Kruskal (1960); a short proof was given by Crispin Nash-Williams (1963).
   It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a
   statement that cannot be proved in ATR_0 (a second-order arithmetic theory
   with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion).

   In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the
   Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in
   reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function
   which dwarfs TREE(3). A finitary application of the theorem gives the
   existence of the fast-growing TREE function.

Statement[edit]

   The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's
   formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

   Given a tree T with a root, and given vertices v, w, call w a successor of
   v if the unique path from the root to w contains v, and call w an
   immediate successor of v if additionally the path from v to w contains no
   other vertex.

   Take X to be a partially ordered set. If T_1, T_2 are rooted trees with
   vertices labeled in X, we say that T_1 is inf-embeddable in T_2 and write
   T_1 ≤ T_2 if there is an injective map F from the vertices of T_1 to the
   vertices of T_2 such that

     * For all vertices v of T_1, the label of v precedes the label of F(v),
     * If w is any successor of v in T_1, then F(w) is a successor of F(v),
       and
     * If w_1, w_2 are any two distinct immediate successors of v, then the
       path from F(w_1) to F(w_2) in T_2 contains F(v).

   Kruskal's tree theorem then states:

     If X is well-quasi-ordered, then the set of rooted trees with labels in
     X is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above.
     (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T_1, T_2, … of rooted trees
     labeled in X, there is some i < j so that T_i ≤ T_j.)

Friedman's work[edit]

   For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and
   proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or
   the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the
   theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much
   weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first
   observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the
   then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees
   above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has size
   one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR_0,^[1] thus
   giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably
   impredicative proof.^[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0, but by adding a "gap condition"^[3] to the definition of the
   order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem
   unprovable in this system.^[4]^[5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour
   theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0.

   Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the
   proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal
   (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).^[citation needed]

Weak tree function[edit]

   Suppose that P(n) is the statement:

           There is some m such that if T_1, ..., T_m is a finite sequence of
           unlabeled rooted trees where T_i has i + n vertices, then
           T_i ≤ T_j for some i < j.

   All the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and
   Kőnig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true,
   but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement "P(n) is true for all
   n".^[6] Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano
   arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n, far faster than any
   primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for
   example.^[citation needed] The least m for which P(n) holds similarly
   grows extremely quickly with n.

   Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have
   the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of unlabeled rooted trees, where
           each T_i has at most i + n vertices, such that T_i ≤ T_j does not
           hold for any i < j ≤ m.

   It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960,
   tree(4) > Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument
   specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than {\displaystyle
   \mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree}
   ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{8}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7).}

   To differentiate the two functions, "TREE" with all letters capitalized is
   the big TREE function and "tree" with all letters in lowercase is the weak
   tree function.

TREE function[edit]

   Sequence of trees where each node is colored either green, red, blueA
   sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue < red <
   green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no
   tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is
   defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

   By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing
   function.^[7] For a positive integer n, take TREE(n)^[a] to be the largest
   m so that we have the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of rooted trees labelled from a
           set of n labels, where each T_i has at most i vertices, such that
           T_i ≤ T_j does not hold for any i < j ≤ m.

   The TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3)
   explodes to a value that is so big that many other "large" combinatorial
   constants, such as Friedman's n(4), n^n(5)(5), and Graham's number,^[b]
   are extremely small by comparison. A lower bound for n(4), and hence an
   extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is A^A(187196)(1).^[c]^[8]
   Graham's number, for example, is much smaller than the lower bound
   A^A(187196)(1). It is approximately {\displaystyle g_{3\uparrow
   ^{187196}3}}, where g_x is Graham's function.
