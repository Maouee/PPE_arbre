   Twenty-four-year-old Joshua Pena of Brownsville, Texas was driving north
   on Highway 71 when the pickup went into the ditch and hit the tree.

   Pena and his passenger, 24-year-old Ruiz Sebastian of Brownsville, Texas,
   were both taken to Sauk Centre Hospital with non-life-threatening
   injuries.
