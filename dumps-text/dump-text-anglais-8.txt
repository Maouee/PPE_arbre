                       What is a Tree? How Does it Work?

   Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, the usually wider
   and thinner-walled layer, called springwood, grows. In the summer, a
   thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
   typical in temperate forest trees.

Tree Physiology

     * A tree is a tall plant with woody tissue. Trees gather light for
       photosynthesis through their leaves; this process creates “food” for
       the tree.
     * Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and serves only to support the
       weight of the tree crown. The outside layers of the tree trunk are the
       only living portion. The cambium produces new wood and new bark.
     * The band of tissue outside of the cambium is the phloem. Phloem
       transports new materials (the sugars created from photosynthesis) from
       the crown to the roots. Dead phloem tissue becomes the bark of a tree.
     * The band of tissue just inside of the cambium is the xylem, which
       transports water from the roots to the crown. Dead xylem tissue forms
       the heartwood, or the wood we use for many different purposes.
     * Every year, trees grow two annual rings. In the spring, usually a
       wider and thinner-walled layer called springwood forms. In the summer,
       a thicker-walled layer, called summerwood, develops. Annual rings are
       typical in temperate forest trees.

Parts of a Tree

     * Leaves – broadleaf or needles; primary location for photosynthesis and
       production of hormones and other chemicals.
     * Twigs and Branches – support structures for leaves, flowers and
       fruits.
     * Crown – the upper part of the tree composed of leaves, twigs,
       branches, flowers and fruit.
     * Flowers – the site of reproduction. Trees can be male, female or both.
       Conifers, however, do not have petals and typical flower structures.
     * Fruits and Seeds – all trees have seeds, most are inside of the fruit.
     * Trunk – generally a single “stem,” but can be multiple-stemmed. Main
       functions are materials transport and support.
     * Bark – main function is to protect the living tissue called cambium
       from damage.
     * Roots – two main functions: (1) collect nutrients and water and (2)
       anchor the tree.

Trees Grow:

     * At the twig tips (apical meristem)
     * At the root tips (root apical meristem)
     * At the cambium (old xylem cells become heartwood, old phloem cells
       become bark)

Why do Leaves Change Color in the Fall?

   Chlorophyll production goes down as night length increases (fall and
   winter). The green colors are no longer reflected and other chemicals in
   the leaf become dominant, revealing red and yellow pigments.

   Weather during the period of declining chlorophyll production influences
   intensity of colors.

     * Warm fall weather generally reduces color quality.
     * Moist soils following a good growing season contribute to greater
       color intensity.
     * A few warm, sunny days and cool nights increase brilliance.
     * Drought usually results in poorer displays.

   Leaves fall in autumn as part of a tree’s preparation for winter dormancy.
   Because it is too cold for water to remain in the plant tissues (freezing
   water would rupture cells in the tree), and because the water in the soil
   is frozen and cannot be absorbed, trees shut down major processes in the
   cold months. Deciduous trees drop their leaves; conifers have strategies
   to maintain their needles during the winter.
