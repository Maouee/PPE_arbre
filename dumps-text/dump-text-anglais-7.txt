   tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most
   plants classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing
   woody tissues, and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs,
   called branches.

   To many, the word tree evokes images of such ancient, powerful, and
   majestic structures as oaks and sequoias, the latter being among the most
   massive and longest-living organisms in the world. Although the majority
   of Earth’s terrestrial biomass is represented by trees, the fundamental
   importance of these seemingly ubiquitous plants for the very existence and
   diversity of life on Earth is perhaps not fully appreciated. The biosphere
   is dependent on the metabolism, death, and recycling of plants, especially
   trees. Their vast trunks and root systems store carbon dioxide, move
   water, and produce oxygen that is released into the atmosphere. The
   organic matter of the soil develops primarily from decayed leaves, twigs,
   branches, roots, and fallen trees, all of which recycle nitrogen, carbon,
   oxygen, and other important nutrients. There are few organisms as
   important as trees for maintaining Earth’s ecology.

   This article discusses the historical, popular, and botanical
   classifications of trees, their evolution, their importance to humans, and
   their general structure and patterns of growth. For more information on
   the three botanical groups that include trees, see fern (e.g., the tree
   ferns), gymnosperm (including conifers), and angiosperm (the flowering
   plants). For general information on plants, see plant.

Classification of trees

   The ancient Greeks developed a classification about 300 bce in which
   plants were grouped according to their general form—that is, as trees,
   shrubs, undershrubs, and vines. This classification was used for almost
   1,000 years. Modern classifications of plants attempt to assign a plant to
   a particular taxon and establish relationships with other plants based on
   genetics, cytology, ecology, behaviour, and probable evolutionary
   lineages, in addition to gross morphology. Popular classifications,
   however, remain useful tools for studying the common stresses that the
   environment exerts on all plants and the general patterns of adaptation
   that are shown no matter how distantly plants are related.

Phylogenetic classifications

   Trees are represented in each of the major groups of the vascular plants:
   pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants that include the tree ferns),
   gymnosperms (cycads, ginkgoes, and conifers), and angiosperms (flowering
   plants).

   Although tree ferns account for only a small percentage of ferns, many are
   conspicuous members of a forest, attaining heights of 7 to 10 metres (23
   to 33 feet); some are 15, 18, or occasionally 24 metres tall (49, 59, or
   79 feet). These graceful trees, which are natives of humid montane forests
   in the tropics and subtropics and of warm temperate regions of the
   Southern Hemisphere, have huge lacy leaves; they are the remnants of a
   vastly more numerous flora that populated much of Earth during the
   Carboniferous Period (about 358.9 to 298.9 million years ago).

   Cycads compose the Cycadophyta, a division of gymnospermous plants
   consisting of 4 families and approximately 140 species. Natives of warm
   regions of the Eastern and Western hemispheres, they also are remnants of
   a much larger number of species that in past geologic ages dominated
   Earth’s flora.

   The ginkgo is the only living representative of the gymnosperm division
   Ginkgophyta. It is a relic that has been preserved in cultivation around
   ancient Buddhist temples in China and planted elsewhere as an ornamental
   since the mid-18th century; the tree probably no longer exists in a wild
   state.

   Conifers (division Pinophyta) are the largest group of gymnosperms and
   include trees and shrubs in 7 extant families and 545 species. Familiar
   representatives are araucarias, cedars, cypresses, Douglas firs, firs,
   hemlocks, junipers, larches, pines, podocarps, redwoods, spruces, and
   yews.

   Dominating Earth’s present flora are the angiosperms, with about 300,000
   species, among which are the majority of the world’s trees. Angiosperms
   are sometimes divided on the basis of a group of characteristics into two
   major groups: the monocotyledons and the eudicotyledons. The most numerous
   of the monocotyledonous trees are palms; others include agaves, aloes,
   dracaenas, screw pines, and yuccas. By far the greatest number of tree
   species are eudicotyledons; they are represented by such familiar groups
   as birches, elms, hollies, maples, oaks, poplars, ashes, and willows.

Ecological and evolutionary classification

   The tree is not an immutable biological category but rather a human
   concept based on visual criteria. Perhaps a general definition would
   describe a tree as a perennial woody plant that develops along a single
   main trunk to a height of at least 4.5 metres (15 feet) at maturity. This
   may be contrasted with a shrub, which might be loosely defined as a woody
   plant with multiple stems that is, in most cases, less than 3 metres
   (about 10 feet) tall. However, a species fitting the description of either
   in one area of the world might not necessarily do so in other regions,
   since a variety of stresses shape the habit of the mature plant. Thus, a
   given woody species may be a tree in one set of habitats within its range
   and a shrub elsewhere. For example, the spruce and fir may thrive in the
   tree form at the base of a mountain but assume a shrub form near the
   mountaintop, the variation due principally to stresses exerted by such
   environmental conditions as altitude, temperature, and oxygen tension.

   As seen in the section above, trees are found among many plant families
   that also include shrubs and herbs, so that the concept of tree is not a
   phylogenetic one. Further, there is no clear consensus as to whether the
   tree form is the advanced or primitive condition. Some paleobotanists
   suggest that trees are the most primitive members within these plant
   families. However, tree forms are found in all the vascular plants, from
   the club mosses and ferns to the gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is
   furthermore true that, among the flowering plants, trees are found not
   only among the most primitive members (order Magnoliales) but also among
   the more specialized, or advanced, members, such as the roses (order
   Rosales).

   Consequently, from both a taxonomic and a phylogenetic perspective, the
   tree is an artificial category. On an ecological basis, however, the tree
   can be recognized as a natural construct, as it represents an adaptive
   strategy by many different taxa to exploit and dominate the habitat above
   the ground.

   In the early stages of the development of terrestrial life, land plants
   were rootless and leafless. Since they had their origins in aqueous
   environments, they did not require the specialized conducting and
   supporting tissues afforded by roots and stems, nor did they require
   localized regions of carbohydrate synthesis, since each cell was involved
   in metabolism, water and nutrient absorption, and respiration. Habitats
   farther from the water as well as aerial habitats represented available
   uninhabited environments.

   One key to exploiting terrestrial habitats is increasing complexity of the
   plant’s form to allow specialization of function. This requires
   physiological and morphological complexity as well as biological
   optimization. If all the tissues of massive tree trunks were alive, for
   example, the physiological cost of maintaining these structures in the
   living state would be enormous and probably unattainable. An elegant
   solution came in the form of tremendous structural adaptations: new
   tissues and organs permitted localization of the functions of the plant
   body.

   The evolution of discrete plant body parts with separate functions allowed
   plants to move onto the land and undergo an incredible adaptive radiation.
   Leaves evolved as specialized photosynthetic organs. Stems provided
   mechanical strength as well as a conductive capacity to transport water
   and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Roots provided anchorage and
   absorption of sufficient water and nutrients to support the remainder of
   the plant.
