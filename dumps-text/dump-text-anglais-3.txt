   [IMG]A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
   [IMG]It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
   men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
   emanates from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
   spirit. ~ Robert Louis Stevenson [IMG]The earth brought forth vegetation,
   plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit
   in which is their seed, according to its kind. And God saw that it was
   good. ~ Genesis 1:12.

   Trees are plants with elongated stems, or trunks, supporting leaves or
   branches. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always
   been revered and they play a role in much of the world's mythology,
   metaphor and symbolism.

   [IMG]A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
   leaves; the tree species, in fact,it needs and evolves to fight the moose,
   to keep the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
   twigs. - Robert T. Bakker
     * He who saves an ancient tree does better even than he who plants a new
       one.
          * Alfred Austin, In Veronica's Garden (London: Macmillan and Co.,
            1895), p. 70.
     * A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
       leaves; the tree species, in fact, evolves to fight the moose, to keep
       the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
       twigs. In the final analysis, the merciless hand of natural selection
       will favor the birch genes that make the tree less and less palatable
       to the moose in generation after generation. No plant species could
       survive for long by offering itself as unprotected fodder.

     * A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
          * William Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790–1793).
     * The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others
       only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see Nature all
       ridicule and deformity, and some scarce see Nature at all. But to the
       eyes of the man of imagination, Nature is Imagination itself.
          * William Blake, The Letters (1799).
     * Lo que soñó la tierra/es visible en el árbol.
          * What the earth dreamt/is written in the tree.

     * No tree in all the grove but has its charms,
       Though each its hue peculiar.

     * Some boundless contiguity of shade.

     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves —
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       *****
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view —
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Pull of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.
          * Dinah Craik, The Mulberry-Tree, reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia
            Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 634.
     * He that planteth a tree is the servant of God,
       He provideth a kindness for many generations,
       And faces that he hath not seen shall bless him.
          * Henry van Dyke, The Friendly Trees.
     * All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All
       these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it
       from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual
       towards freedom.
          * Albert Einstein, in "Moral Decay" (1937); later published in Out
            of My Later Years (1950).
     * Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they
       had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which
       do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three
       years till the new comes.
          * The Book of Enoch ch.3 [1]
     * When iron was found, the trees began to tremble, but the iron
       reassured them: 'Let no handle made from you enter into anything made

            Samuel Rapaport, (1907), p. 61
     * If you love me, be patient. Look at the trees. Are they in a hurry to
       ripen their fruit?
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Last Temptation of Christ (1951)
     * The entire Earth, with her trees and her waters, with her animals,
       with her men and her gods, calls from within your breast.
       Earth rises up in your brains and sees her entire body for the first
       time.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "Fourth Step :
            The Earth"
     * Every man has his own circle composed of trees, animals, men, ideas,
       and he is in duty bound to save this circle. He, and no one else. If
       he does not save it, he cannot be saved.
       These are the labors each man is given and is in duty bound to
       complete before he dies. He may not otherwise be saved. For his own
       soul is scattered and enslaved in these things about him, in trees, in
       animals, in men, in ideas, and it is his own soul he saves by
       completing these labors.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in The Saviors of God (1923), "The Action :
            The Relationship between Man and Nature"
     * From the acorn, quickly sprouting,
       Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy, Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,
       Pressed compactly all the grasses, From the ground enriched by ashes,
       That the maidens had been raking, Newly raked by water-maidens;
       When a fire within them kindles, Spread the oak-tree's many branches,
       And the flames shot up to heaven, Rounds itself a broad corona,
       Till the windrows burned to ashes, Raises it above the storm-clouds;
       Only ashes now remaining
       Far it stretches out its branches,
       Of the grasses raked together. Stops the white-clouds in their
       courses,
       In the ashes of the windrows, With its branches hides the sunlight,
       Tender leaves the giant places, With its many leaves, the moonbeams,
       In the leaves he plants an acorn, And the starlight dies in heaven.
          * Kalevala, Rune II. translated by John Martin Crawford (1888). [2]
     * Trees — especially old trees — have a strong and definite
       individuality, well worthy the name of a soul. This soul, though
       temporary, in the sense that it is not yet a reincarnating entity, is
       nevertheless possessed of considerable power and intelligence along
       its own lines. It has decided likes and dislikes, and to clairvoyant
       sight it shows quite clearly by a vivid rosy flush an emphatic
       enjoyment of the sunlight and the rain, and distinct pleasure also in
       the presence of those whom it has learnt to like, or with whom it has
       sympathetic vibrations. Emerson appears to have realised this, for he
       is quoted in Hutton’s Reminiscences as saying of his trees:

           "I am sure they miss me ; they seem to droop when I go away, and I
           know they brighten and bloom when I go back to them and shake
           hands with their lower branches.”

     *    * C.W. Leadbeater, The Hidden Side of things (1913)
     * Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,
       A sylvan scene, and as the ranks ascend
       Shade above shade, a woody theatre
       Of stateliest view.
          * John Milton, Paradise Lost (1667; 1674), Book IV, line 139.
     * And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
       High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit
       Of vegetable gold.
          * John Milton, Paradise Lost (1667; 1674), Book IV, line 218.
     * A pillar'd shade
       High over-arch'd, and echoing walks between.
          * John Milton, Paradise Lost (1667; 1674), Book IX, line 1,106.
     * It's interesting, isn't it? There are many stories about trees giving
       curses (Tatari) in the Western part of Japan. Such folklore, or
       something that goes back to our distant memories, remains strongly in
       Japanese culture. People on Yakushima Island didn't cut the trees.
       They thought that cutting trees would bring about a curse. Trees are
       beings that make us feel that way. I learned it when I went to
       Yakushima. When they decided to cut and sell trees because they were
       too poor to eat, there was a monk who recommended cutting the trees.
       It was not the case that they started cutting tress because a certain
       person happened to be on the island and said so, but rather to do with
       the changes in the society itself.

              * Hayao Miyazaki Miyazaki on Mononoke-hime Nausica.net (July
                1997)

     * I think that I shall never see
       A billboard lovely as a tree.
       Perhaps, unless the billboards fall,
       I'll never see a tree at all.
          * Ogden Nash, Song of the Open Road (1933).
     * Perhaps you see big trees and little trees and think that big trees
       are older than little trees. You also might notice that there are more
       little trees than big trees, and so not every little tree grows up to
       be a big tree – most die young. But the little trees must come from
       somewhere, namely seeds produced and shed by the bigger trees. These
       are the core ideas of population ecology.

     * The woods are hush'd, their music is no more;
       The leaf is dead, the yearning past away;
       New leaf, new life—the days of frost are o'er;
       New life, new love, to suit the newer day:

       unity.
          * Robin Wall Kimmerer Braiding Sweetgrass (2013)
     * Trees perspire profusely, condense largely, and check evaporation so
       much, that woods are always moist: no wonder therefore that they
       contribute much to pools and streams.
       That trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well
       known fact in North-America; for, since the woods and forests have
       been grubbed and cleared, all bodies of water have much diminished; so
       that some streams, that were very considerable a century ago, will not
       now drive a common mill.

      Planting[edit]

     * The best time to plant a tree was thirty years ago; the second best
       time is today
          * Variants include: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years
            ago. The second best time is now."
               * From the Congressional Record of 1969: "It has been said
                 that the best time to plant a tree was thirty years ago, the
                 second best time is today."
               * A possible precursor from the 1950s: "Pruning of nature
                 apple trees can be done safely at any time and, if you
                 haven't already started, now is the second-best time to do
                 it." (Tennessee horticulture (1956)

     * The place is all Awave with trees,
       Limes, myrtles, purple-beaded,

       No school of long experience, that the world
       Is full of guilt and misery, and hast seen

       To tire thee of it, enter this wild wood
       And view the haunts of Nature. The calm shade

       The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,

     * A great acacia, with its slender trunk
       And overpoise of multitudinous leaves,
       (In which a hundred fields might spill their dew

       Stood reconciling all the place with green.
          * Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Aurora Leigh (1856), Book VI.

    Almond (Prunus dulcis)[edit]

   [IMG]I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God"
   and the almond tree blossomed. ~ Nikos Kazantzakis [IMG]Here was an almond
   tree in bloom before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. ~
   Nikos Kazantzakis
     * I said to the almond tree: "Speak to me of God."

     * I heard the bells from the future churches, the children playing and
       laughing in the schoolyards … and here was an almond tree in bloom
       before me: I must reach out and cut a flowering branch. For, by
       believing passionately in something which still does not exist, we
       create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently
       desired, whatever we have not irrigated with our blood to such a
       degree that it becomes strong enough to stride across the somber
       threshold of nonexistence.
          * Nikos Kazantzakis, in Report to Greco (1965)

    Ash (Fraxinus)[edit]

     * The ash her purple drops forgivingly
       And sadly, breaking not the general hush;
       The maple swamps glow like a sunset sea,
       Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
       All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze,
       Of bushes low, as when, on cloudy days,
       Ere the rain falls, the cautious farmer burns his brush.
          * James Russell Lowell, An Indian-Summer Reverie, Stanza 11,

    Aspen (Populus Tremuloides)[edit]

     * THE quiet of the evening hour
       Was laid on every summer leaf;
       That purple shade was on each flower,
       At once so beautiful, so brief,
       Only the aspen knew not rest,
       But still, with an unquiet song,
       Kept murmuring to the gentle west,
       And cast a changeful shade along.

            August, 1830, 'The Aspen Tree', also published in The Vow of the

     * What whispers so strange at the hour of midnight,
       From the aspen leaves trembling so wildly?
       Why in the lone wood sings it sad, when the bright
       Full moon beams upon it so mildly?
          * B. S. Ingemann, The Aspen.
     * At that awful hour of the Passion, when the Saviour of the world felt
       deserted in His agony, when—
       "The sympathizing sun his light withdrew,
       And wonder'd how the stars their dying Lord could view"—
       when earth, shaking with horror, rung the passing bell for Deity, and
       universal nature groaned, then from the loftiest tree to the lowliest
       flower all felt a sudden thrill, and trembling, bowed their heads, all
       save the proud and obdurate aspen, which said, "Why should we weep and
       tremble? we trees, and plants, and flowers are pure and never sinned!"
       Ere it ceased to speak, an involuntary trembling seized its very leaf,
       and the word went forth that it should never rest, but tremble on
       until the day of judgment.
          * Legend, from Notes and Queries, first series, Volume VI, No. 161.
     * Beneath a shivering canopy reclined,
       Of aspen leaves that wave without a wind,
       I love to lie, when lulling breezes stir
       The spiry cones that tremble on the fir.
          * John Leyden, Noontide.
     * And the wind, full of wantonness, wooes like a lover
       The young aspen-trees till they tremble all over.
          * Thomas Moore, Lalla Rookh (1817), Light of the Harem.

    Birch (Betula)[edit]

     * Rippling through thy branches goes the sunshine,
       Among thy leaves that palpitate forever,
       And in thee, a pining nymph had prisoned
       The soul, once of some tremulous inland river,
       Quivering to tell her woe, but ah! dumb, dumb forever.

     * That was a day of delight and wonder.
       While lying the shade of the maple trees under—
       He felt the soft breeze at its frolicksome play;
       He smelled the sweet odor of newly mown hay.
          * Thomas Dunn English, Under the Trees.
     * I mark me how today the maples wear
       A look of inward burgeoning, and I feel
       Colours I see not in the naked air,
       Lance-keen, and with the little blue of steel.
          * Edward O'Brien, In Late Spring.

    Mulberry Tree (Morus)[edit]

     * Retracing our steps to the garden we see two trees which are redolent
       of the past - a medlar and a mulberry. This last is not a beautiful
       tree. It covers itself with such dense masses of heavy foliage; its
       form has neither grace nor dignity - and yet we love it.
          * C. Trollope, Suite: In Chill October, The Gentleman's Magazine
            (April, 1899).
     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!
       Bare long after the rest are green;
       But as time steals onwards, while none perceives
       Slowly she clothes herself with leaves—
       Hides her fruit under them, hard to find.
       * * * * *
       But by and by, when the flowers grow few
       And the fruits are dwindling and small to view—
       Out she comes in her matron grace
       With the purple myriads of her race;
       Full of plenty from root to crown,
       Showering plenty her feet adown.
       While far over head hang gorgeously
       Large luscious berries of sanguine dye,
       For the best grows highest, always highest,
       Upon the mulberry-tree.
          * Dinah Craik, The Mulberry-Tree, reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia
            Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 534.

           (1922), p. 563.

     * A song to the oak, the brave old oak,
       Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;
       Here's health and renown to his broad green crown,
       And his fifty arms so strong.
       There's fear in his frown when the Sun goes down,
       And the fire in the West fades out;
       And he showeth his might on a wild midnight,
       When the storms through his branches shout.
          * H. F. Chorley, The Brave Old Oak.
     * The oak, when living, monarch of the wood;
       The English oak, which, dead, commands the flood.
          * Charles Churchill, Gotham, I, 303.
     * Old noted oak! I saw thee in a mood
       Of vague indifference; and yet with me
       Thy memory, like thy fate, hath lingering stood
       For years, thou hermit, in the lonely sea
       Of grass that waves around thee!
          * John Clare, The Rural Muse, Burthorp Oak.
   [IMG]The monarch oak, the patriarch of the trees,
   Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees.
   Three centuries he grows, and three he stays
   Supreme in state; and in three more decays.
   John Dryden
     * The monarch oak, the patriarch of the trees,
       Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees.
       Three centuries he grows, and three he stays

     * Tall oaks from little acorns grow.
          * David Everett, Lines for a School Declamation.
     * The oaks with solemnity shook their heads;
       The twigs of the birch-trees, in token
       Of warning, nodded,—and I exclaim'd:
       "Dear Monarch, forgive what I've spoken!"
          * Heinrich Heine, Songs, Germany, Caput XVII.
     * Those green-robed senators of mighty woods,
       Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
       Dream, and so dream all night without a stir.
          * John Keats, Hyperion (1818-19), Book I, line 73.
     * The tall Oak, towering to the skies,
       The fury of the wind defies,
       From age to age, in virtue strong.
       Inured to stand, and suffer wrong.
          * James Montgomery, The Oak.
     * There grewe an aged tree on the greene;
       A goodly Oake sometime had it bene,
       With armes full strong and largely displayed,
       But of their leaves they were disarayde
       The bodie bigge, and mightely pight,
       Thoroughly rooted, and of wond'rous hight;
       Whilome had bene the king of the field,
       And mochell mast to the husband did yielde,
       And with his nuts larded many swine:
       But now the gray mosse marred his rine;
       His bared boughes were beaten with stormes,
       His toppe was bald, and wasted with wormes,
       His honour decayed, his braunches sere.
          * Edmund Spenser, Shepheard's Callender, "Februarie".

      Peabody Museum of Salem[edit]

     * Our Mountains are cover'd with Imperial Oak
       Whose Roots, like our liberties, ages have nourished
       But long e're our Nation submits to the Yoke
       Not a Tree shall be left on the Field where it Flourished
       Should Invasion impend, every Tree would defend
       From the Hill tops they shaded, our Shores to defend
       For ne'er shall the Sons of Columbia be Slaves
       While the Earth bears a Plant, or the Sea rolls its Waves.

           Quotes reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations
           (1922), p. 577.

     * As the palm-tree standeth so straight and so tall,
       The more the hail beats, and the more the rains fall.
          * Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Annie of Tharaw; translation from the
            German of Simon Dach, line 11.
     * First the high palme-trees, with braunches faire,
       Out of the lowly vallies did arise,
       And high shoote up their heads into the skyes.
          * Edmund Spenser, Virgil's Gnat, line 191.
     * Next to thee, O fair gazelle,
       O Beddowee girl, beloved so well;

       Next to the fearless Nedjidee,
       Whose fleetness shall bear me again to thee;

       Next to ye both I love the Palm,
       With his leaves of beauty, his fruit of balm;

       Next to ye both I love the Tree
       Whose fluttering shadow wraps us three
       With love, and silence, and mystery!
          * Bayard Taylor, The Arab to the Palm.
     * Of threads of palm was the carpet spun
       Whereon he kneels when the day is done,
       And the foreheads of Islam are bowed as one!

       To him the palm is a gift divine,
       Wherein all uses of man combine,—
       House and raiment and food and wine!

       And, in the hour of his great release,
       His need of the palms shall only cease
       With the shroud wherein he lieth in peace.

       "Allah il Allah!" he sings his psalm,
       On the Indian Sea, by the isles of balm;
       "Thanks to Allah, who gives the palm!"
          * John Greenleaf Whittier, The Palm-Tree.
     * What does the good ship bear so well?
       The cocoa-nut with its stony shell,
       And the milky sap of its inner cell.

     * Shaggy shade
       Of desert-loving pine, whose emerald scalp
       Nods to the storm.
          * Lord Byron, The Prophecy of Dante, Canto II, line 63.
     * Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines.
          * Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Hymn Before Sunrise in the Vale of
            Chamouni.
     * 'Twas on the inner bark, stripped from the pine,
       Our father pencilled this epistle rare;
       Two blazing pine knots did his torches shine,
       Two braided pallets formed his desk and chair.
          * Durfee, What-Cheer, Canto II.
     * As sunbeams stream through liberal space
       And nothing jostle or displace,
       So waved the pine-tree through my thought
       And fanned the dreams it never brought.
          * Ralph Waldo Emerson, Woodnotes, II.
     * Like two cathedral towers these stately pines
       Uplift their fretted summits tipped with cones;
       The arch beneath them is not built with stones,
       Not Art but Nature traced these lovely lines,
       And carved this graceful arabasque of vines;
       No organ but the wind here sighs and moans,
       No sepulchre conceals a martyr's bones,
       No marble bishop on his tomb reclines.
       Enter! the pavement, carpeted with leaves,
       Gives back a softened echo to thy tread!
       Listen! the choir is singing; all the birds,
       In leafy galleries beneath the eaves,
       Are singing! listen, ere the sound be fled,
       And learn there may be worship without words.
          * Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Sonnets, My Cathedral.
     * Under the yaller pines I house,
       When sunshine makes 'em all sweet-scented,
       An' hear among their furry boughs
       The baskin' west-wind purr contented.
          * James Russell Lowell, The Biglow Papers, Second Series, No. 10.
     * The pine is the mother of legends.
          * James Russell Lowell, The Growth of a Legend.
     * To archèd walks of twilight groves,
       And shadows brown that Sylvan loves,
       Of pine.
          * John Milton, Il Penseroso (1631), line 133.
     * Here also grew the rougher rinded pine,
       The great Argoan ship's brave ornament.
          * Edmund Spenser, Virgil's Gnat, line 209.
     * Ancient Pines,
       Ye bear no record of the years of man.
       Spring is your sole historian.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.
     * Stately Pines,
       But few more years around the promontory
       Your chant will meet the thunders of the sea.
          * Bayard Taylor, The Pine Forest of Monterey.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Poplar (Populus Fastigiata)[edit]

     * We knew it would rain, for the poplars showed
       The white of their leaves, the amber grain
       Shrunk in the wind,—and the lightning now
       Is tangled in tremulous skeins of rain.
          * Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Before the Rain, reported in Hoyt's New
            Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 655.
     * Trees that, like the poplar, hit upward all their boughs, give no
       shade and no shelter, whatever their height. Trees the most lovingly
       shelter and shade us, when, like the willow, the higher soar their
       summits, the lowlier droop their boughs.
          * Edward Bulwer-Lytton, What Will He Do With It? (1858), Book XI,
            Chapter X, introductory lines.

    Tulip-Tree (Liriodendron Tulipifera)[edit]

          * William Cullen Bryant, A Strange Lady, Stanza 6; reported in
            Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.
     * The tulip-tree, high up,
       Opened, in airs of June, her multitude
       Of golden chalices to humming birds
       And silken-winged insects of the sky.
          * William Cullen Bryant, The Fountain, Stanza 3; reported in Hoyt's
            New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 823.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Umbellularia[edit]

     * The Spice-Tree lives in the garden green,
       Beside it the fountain flows;
       And a fair Bird sits the boughs between,
       And sings his melodious woes.
       * * * * * *
       That out-bound stem has branches three;
       On each a thousand blossoms grow;
       And old as aught of time can be,
       The root stands fast in the rocks below.
          * John Sterling, The Spice-Tree, Stanzas 1 and 3.

     * I'll hang my harp on a willow tree.
          * John, Lord Elphinstone; also credited to Thomas Haynes Bayly.
     * Willow, in thy breezy moan,

     * Near the lake where drooped the willow,
       Long time ago.

       Whose grey leaves quiver,
       Whispering gloomily
       To yon pale river?

       Lady, at even-tide

       They say its branches hide
       A sad, lost spirit!

           (1922), p. 921.

     * Careless, unsocial plant! that loves to dwell
       'Midst skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms:
       Where light-heel'd ghosts and visionary shades,
       Beneath the wan, cold Moon (as Fame reports)
       Embodied, thick, perform their mystic rounds.
       No other merriment, dull tree! is thine.
          * Robert Blair, The Grave, line 22.
     * For there no yew nor cypress spread their gloom
       But roses blossom'd by each rustic tomb.
          * Thomas Campbell, Theodric, line 22.
     * Slips of yew
       Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse.
          * William Shakespeare, Macbeth (1605), Act IV, scene 1, line 27.
     * Of vast circumference and gloom profound,
       This solitary Tree! A living thing
       Produced too slowly ever to decay;
       Of form and aspect too magnificent
       To be destroyed.
          * William Wordsworth, Yew-Trees.
