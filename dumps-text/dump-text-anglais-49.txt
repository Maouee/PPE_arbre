   Trees

   A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or
   as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data
   structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections
   between elements, giving a tree graph.

   Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of
   trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices.

   A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends
   containing no closed loops (cycles). In other words, it is a simple,
   undirected, connected, acyclic graph (or, equivalently, a connected
   forest). A tree with n nodes has n-1 graph edges. Conversely, a connected
   graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. All trees are bipartite graphs
   (Skiena 1990, p. 213). Trees with no particular node singled out are
   sometimes called free trees (or unrooted tree), by way of distinguishing
   them from rooted trees (Skiena 1990, Knuth 1997).

   The points of connection are known as forks and the segments as branches.
   Final segments and the nodes at their ends are called tree leaves. A tree
   with two branches at each fork and with one or two tree leaves at the end
   of each branch is called a binary tree.

   A graph can be tested in the Wolfram Language to see if it is a tree using
   TreeGraphQ[g].

   Hydrocarbons

   Trees find applications in many diverse fields, including computer
   science, the enumeration of saturated hydrocarbons, the study of
   electrical circuits, etc. (Harary 1994, p. 4). The graphs graphs
   corresponding to linear hydrocarbons illustrated above are known as
   (n-)alkane graphs (or sometimes caterpillar graphs).

   Trees are block graphs.

   A tree T has either one node that is a graph center, in which case it is
   called a centered tree, or two adjacent nodes that are graph centers, in
   which case it is called a bicentered tree (Harary 1994, p. 35).

   When a special node is designated to turn a tree into a rooted tree, it is
   called the root (or sometimes "Eve"). In such a tree, each of the nodes
   that is one graph edge further away from a given node is called a child,
   and nodes connected to the same node that are the same distance from the
   root vertex are called siblings.

   Note that two branches placed end-to-end are equivalent to a single
   branch, which means for example, that there is only one tree of order 3.
   The number t(n) of nonisomorphic trees of order n=1, 2, ... (where trees
   of orders 1, 2, ..., 6 are illustrated above), are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11,
   23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ... (OEIS A000055).

   The generating functions for the number of rooted trees

                  T(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)T_nx^n                         (1) 
                       =  xexp[sum_(r=1)^(infty)1/rT(x^r)]                (2) 

   is related to the generating function for the number of unrooted trees
   t(x) by

                      t(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)t_nx^n                     (3) 
                           =  T(x)-1/2[T^2(x)-T(x^2)].                    (4) 

   Otter showed that

   lim_(n->infty)(t_nn^(5/2))/(alpha^n)=beta,                             (5) 

   (Otter 1948, Harary and Palmer 1973, Knuth 1997), where alpha and beta are
   two constants. alpha is given by

                   alpha =  lim_(n->infty)(T_n)/(T_(n-1))                 (6) 
                         =  2.955765...                                   (7) 

   (OEIS A051491; Odlyzko 1995; Knuth 1997, p. 396, where Knuth writes
   1/alpha=2.9557... instead of alpha=2.9557...) and also as the unique
   positive root of

   T(1/x)=1.                                                              (8) 

   The constant beta is given by

beta = 1/(sqrt(2pi))[1+sum_(k=2)^(infty)T^'(1/(alpha^k))1/(alpha^k)]^(3/2)  (9) 
     = 0.5349485...                                                        (10) 

   (OEIS A086308; Knuth 1997, p. 396).

   If t_n is the number of nonisomorphic trees on n nodes, then an asymptotic
   series for t_n is given by

t_n∼alpha^nn^(-5/2)(0.5349496061...+(0.0441699018...)/n+(0.4853877311...)/(n^2)+(2.379745574...)/(n^3)+...), (11) 

   where the constants can be computed in terms of partial derivatives of the
   function

   F(x,y)=xexp[y+sum_(k=2)^infty(T(x^k))/k]-y                            (12) 

   (Plotkin and Rosenthal 1994; Finch 2003).
