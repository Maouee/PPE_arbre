   There are a multitude of “heat islands” across Oahu that harm humans and
   increase economic costs.

   Al Gore once said, “The best available technology for pulling carbon
   dioxide from the air is something called a tree.”

   True, Mr. Gore. Trees provide cooling at a global scale by sequestering
   carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming.
   Trees are also the smartest available technology at the local level for
   cooling our homes, schools, and parks through evaporation and shading.

   Yet Honolulu is losing trees. Why? It’s a loss of a tree here, a tree
   there. In short, lots of little things that collectively add up to a big
   problem. 

   This is what the youth, in a Trees for Honolulu’s Future initiative called
   “Heat Island Investigators,” discovered over the past year. Heat islands
   are locales often associated with urban development that experience higher
   temperatures than surrounding areas.

   Honolulu has many such locations where buildings and roads absorb and
   reemit the sun’s heat. Urban areas, where human-built infrastructure like
   this is concentrated and greenery is limited, become “islands” of higher
   temperatures relative to outlying areas.

   Why are trees so good at mitigating heat islands?

     * Trees act like pumps as roots gather water from the soil and release
       it to the atmosphere where it evaporates, cooling the air in a process
       called transpiration.
     * Trees act like umbrellas as leaves in the canopy intercept and reflect
       solar radiation keeping surfaces below cooler because they are
       shielded from direct sun.

   Groups of trees are most impactful. Isolated trees provide some, but
   limited cooling as wind passes warmer air from adjacent areas beneath the
   canopy in a process called advection. Quite simply, more trees equals more
   cooling.

   The Heat Island Investigators initiative included two sites, both of which
   are underserved areas that are heat islands: Aiea Intermediate School and
   Makalapa Neighborhood Park (via Parents and Children Together program at
   Puuwai Momi public housing).

Taking The Temperature

   At each site student scientists developed maps of current conditions,
   including measuring and plotting trees and temperatures, and identified
   solutions by applying experiential place-based learning using an array of
   sophisticated equipment and a rigorous testing regime.

   Temperature, light, and canopy conditions were measured under and adjacent
   to a number of trees at several local parks. Measurements in the shade and
   sun were taken simultaneously at cardinal directions to account for
   differences in canopy density as well as time of day and year.

   Measurements of temperature and light from canopy shade and in the
   adjacent sunlight show the difference that shade can make. A partial gap
   in the canopy shows intermediate temperature and brightness. Sunlight
   explains 99% difference in temperature. (Courtesy Daniel Dinell)

   Now here’s where findings got interesting. Measurements of surface
   temperature and light associated with sun and shade under and around a
   Monkeypod tree illustrate the relationship of sun exposure to surface
   temperature. Sensors in the sun were about 12 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
   and it was about 20 times brighter whereas under a partial gap in the
   canopy light and temperature were intermediate.

   It’s no big surprise that shaded surface temperatures were cooler, yet the
   ambient air temperature, measured in a solar radiation shield, showed only
   a 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit difference between sun and shade.

   The conclusion? Air isn’t necessarily cooler in the shade, but surfaces
   that are in the shade stay cooler.

   Even without trees, in areas getting the same amount of solar radiation,
   such as a grassy field versus on an outdoor basketball court, it will feel
   cooler on the grass. There are other factors such as wind and humidity as
   well — the takeaway here is air temperature isn’t the only factor in how
   hot, or cool, one feels.

   It’s not just the youth who have figured this out. The City and County of
   Honolulu Climate Change Commission has identified heat impact as both a
   stress through urban heat islands and as a shock through heat waves.

   Honolulu has a multitude of heat islands that cause serious human impacts
   such as heat-related mortality and morbidity, as well as economic costs
   such as increased peak electricity demand. Trees aren’t the only answer to
   this situation, but they sure are a smart, cost-effective, response.

   Fortunately, change at Makalapa Neighborhood Park, featured in a May 2023
   Civil Beat story, is underway. In September 2023, after Noah Kindaro, a
   10-year-old youth, testified at the Honolulu City Council Committee on
   Parks, the park’s lights were turned on the next evening.

   A Friends of Makalapa Park community group is in the process of being
   established. And the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation is
   exploring planting shade trees. Read on to discover why trees are an
   excellent way to help this, and other areas of Honolulu, reduce how hot it
   feels.

How To Help

   How can you make a difference in reducing the urban heat island effect?

   Plant a tree in your own yard. Myriad resources for advice abound,
   including at TreesForHonolululu.org, local nurseries, and certified
   arborists to help you select the right tree in the right place and provide
   the right care.

   Volunteer! Numerous organizations actively plant and maintain trees. Where
   to start? The Events listing at TreesForHonolululu.org is a good place.

   Request a street tree. Call the City’s Division of Urban Forestry at (808)
   971-7151 or email DUF@honolulu.gov. Keep in mind that not all requests
   will be approved as the location must meet various standards, however,
   staff will review and consider your request. If approved, the city will
   plant and prune the tree, but you will need to commit to watering the
   trees to help get it established.

   Advocate for urban trees as if your life depends on it, because it does.
   This initiative received financial support from the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency under an Assistance Agreement. For more,

   See Haleiwa_Dad below...Lollipopped trees seem to be a spreading cancer.
   It takes work to maintain landscaped parks and parking lots, etc. "Too
   much humbug" to rake leaves and seedpods from all over.Root of problem
   (pun intended) is landscape designers seem clueless about what to plant
   where. That is tied to the fact that nurseries seem not to be able to
   invest in longterm housing of appropriate trees to get them up to size.
   Then, when a contract is had to plant parking medians, designers scramble
   and end up with Enny Kine Stuffs. Lots of beautiful quick-growing kou with
   their abundant deadly spherical seed pods, kamani that grow way too big,
   loulu from Fiji rather than one of our HawaiÊ»i ones, and the usual
   quick-turnover natives: hibiscuses , pÅhinahina, Ê»Äkia, Ê»ukiÊ»uki,
   etc. Often overlooked are Ê»aÊ»aliÊ»i, pili, wiliwili, alaheÊ»e, lama, and
   of course our beloved Ê»ÅhiÊ»a. Why? No moÊ». No can get. Too expensive.
   Just think: If Ê»ÅhiÊ»a were planted all over in new and old
   developments, along with their friends to form kÄ«puka, weÊ»d perhaps
   ensure its survival against ROD. But to do that, we need to invest in
   their cultivation. Same too with loulu. And, educate everyone.

   Saw some interesting studies out of warming European cities; they studied
   foot traffic in downtowns where large sail-like canopies had been
   installed over the streets and groups of trees were planted in frequent
   pocket parks. Surface heat was greatly reduced in the resulting shade and
   shoppers returned to the community because they werenât broiling in sun.
   The shade was available immediately and maintenance costs minimal.

   There is zero enforcement of building codes that require trees and shrubs
   planted in new or expanded parking lots and landscaped street-facing
   planters. Typically the construction contractor installs per plans, then
   the owners/maintainers let 'em die, improperly prune by stunting and
   'lollypop' rounding over, or actually remove and not replace. I've seen a
   maintenance guy torture trees, at a gas station along Kam Hwy, by
   literally plucking off the leaves, from a ladder, repeatedly, until it
   died. No one ever comes back and makes 'em replant the trees. Better
   solution would be groups of trees or a large tree, allowed to grow large,
   on a corner or edge and not try to spot lollypop trees every so many
   stalls like you see. The key is actual shaded areas on the parking lot,
   not how many shadeless lolly pops you have.
