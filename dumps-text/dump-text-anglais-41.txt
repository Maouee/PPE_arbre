   A docent in the Yale Center for British Art tapped Lee Pelton on the
   shoulder and handed him a box of tissues. The president of The Boston
   Foundation had been moved to tears observing an exhibit titled Lynching
   Tree (2013) by Steve McQueen.

   For several weeks, the experience stayed with Pelton. He wanted to bring
   it to Boston.

   He noted that the title of the exhibit is not “The Lynching Tree”, but
   rather “Lynching Tree" — a symbolic representation of the terror of
   lynching, which claimed the lives of almost 4,500 Black Americans from
   1877-1950 in the years after the Civil War.

   “I was really overcome with grief and a kind of horrific pain," Pelton
   said of the exhibit Tuesday on Boston Public Radio. "What it represented
   for me is the way in which history, particularly of Black Americans, is
   hidden."

   Pelton said he thought the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum was the best
   place to "recreate the experience that I had with its intimacy.”

   Peggy Fogelman, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, agreed.
   Steve McQueen’s "Lynching Tree" will be exhibited at the museum for two
   weeks, from Jan. 20 through Feb. 4, 2024.

   “This is a continuation of the kind of work that the Gardner has been
   doing over the past few years," Fogelman said. "Our exhibitions are built
   on the premise that art has something really important to say about the
   issues that face us today.”

   The museum usually plans out exhibits 3 to 5 years in advance but made an
   exception.

   “We could wait five years and give it the normal exhibition full run,
   which is three months, or we could do it now and have a shorter run. And
   it seemed to both of us really important to do it now,” Fogelman said.

   The timing of the exhibit also coincides with the ten-year anniversary of
   McQueen's Academy Award for "12 Years a Slave" and the 50th anniversary of
   the desegregation crisis in Boston schools. It also marks the second time
   the photograph will be displayed in an American museum, following its
   initial showcase at Yale.

   Steve McQueen's preference for displaying Lynching Tree on its own will be
   honored by its placement in the Fenway Gallery. Both Pelton and Fogelman
   said they are eager to witness Boston's response to the exhibit,
   anticipating not only a deep emotional response from visitors but also a
   collective confrontation with the "ugly and horrific truths" the work
   represents.

   “That's the only way we can move forward,” Fogelman said.
