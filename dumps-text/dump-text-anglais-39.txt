   Gulfport bonfire

   tree bonfire for Epiphany each year on a beach near where the former
   church building stood until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

   [Episcopal News Service] The Christian holy day Epiphany, on Jan. 6, is
   also known as the “Feast of Lights,” and some Episcopal congregations
   celebrate this feast quite literally, by burning Christmas trees and
   greens in recognition of Jesus as a light to the world.

   “If you’ve ever seen Christmas trees burn … they go up in a tremendous
   blaze,” the Rev. Hillary Raining told Episcopal News Service in describing
   the annual Epiphany bonfire at St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in
   Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, where she is rector.

   A similar blaze is planned at All Saints’ Episcopal Church in
   Russellville, Arkansas. The fire, a mix of Christmas trees and ordinary
   firewood, will be followed by a short liturgy and blessing of kits of
   chalk that attendees can use to mark their front doors with the initials
   of the Magi, another beloved Epiphany tradition.

   “It’s something that allows us again to remind folks that the church is in
   the world and not just in the church building,” the Rev. Mercedes
   Clements, rector at All Saints’, told ENS.

   And at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Gulfport, Mississippi, the
   congregation will continue a local Epiphany tradition dating back more
   than 50 years when it hosts a Christmas tree bonfire on a nearby beach.
   The Epiphany bonfire has taken on greater meaning to the St. Mark’s
   congregation in the years since Hurricane Katrina destroyed the former
   church in 2005.

   “We celebrate in prayers of hope and gratefulness for the New Year, then
   enjoy hot chocolate and the first King Cakes of the year,” the church says
   on its website.

   The light from a Christmas tree fire invokes symbolism partly rooted in
   Epiphany’s origins as an alternative to pagan festivals that were held on
   the winter solstice – the darkest day of the year. Also known as Three
   Kings Day, Epiphany traditionally commemorates the day the Magi were
   introduced to the infant Jesus. Light also is a familiar motif in
   contemporary lectionary readings for Epiphany, such as Isaiah 60:1-6:
   “Arise, shine; for your light has come.”

   Some of the clergy interviewed by ENS emphasized that the purpose is not
   to demonize darkness but to celebrate Jesus’ earthly role.

   “It is not a good-bad binary. Darkness is not the representation of bad or
   evil. It’s just a contrast,” said the Very Rev. Steven Thomason, dean of
   St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, Washington. “The spiritual
   journey includes both, and can honor both.”

   St. Mark’s will hold its Epiphany festivities after sundown Jan. 5,
   starting with Holy Eucharist in the cathedral. Worshippers then will
   proceed out to the parking lot, where Advent wreaths and other Christmas
   greens will be burned in a fire pit. Dozens usually attend, sipping hot
   chocolate and apple cider around a modest blaze.

   “It’s still a nice fire to warm by and to have the brightness of the
   light,” Thomason said. “It’s a great source of joy for folks in the middle
   of winter.”

   At All Saints’, the church in Arkansas, the bonfire is scheduled for the
   evening Jan. 6. Clements will lead an adaptation of Evening Prayer as
   worshipers gather outdoors around the burning trees. The church is located
   on a wooded property, so the congregation will keep the blaze small for
   safety, Clements said, while still “bringing some light into the darkness,
   and reminding us that Jesus does that in our lives.”

   Raining, the rector at St. Christopher’s in suburban Philadelphia, noted
   that Christmas tree burns have ancient roots in Twelfth Night
   celebrations, which marked the end of the Christmas season. And though
   burning trees may not seem like the most environmentally friendly
   practice, Raining said it is preferable to leaving trees on the curb for
   disposal in a landfill. Also, the ashes from the fire will be used to
   fertilize the grounds of the church.

   St. Christopher’s will host its Christmas tree bonfire in the evening Jan.
   7, with the public invited to bring trees and greens from home. Past
   bonfires have been community events, attracting some residents who don’t
   normally attend the church. The church also invites the local fire
   department, both as a safety precaution and so Raining can bless the fire
   truck.

   “We really consider this part of our pastoring the community,” Raining
   said. “There’s something about gathering in what in the Northern
   Hemisphere are the darkest of nights and being able to talk about Jesus.”

   Attendees also are encouraged to identify things they wish to let go of in
   the new year and write them on slips of paper. The slips then are tossed
   into the fire and sent up, like prayers.
