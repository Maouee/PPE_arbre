   A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart
   representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More
   detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as
   genograms.

Representations of family history[edit]

   Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a
   pedigree or ancestry chart. Family trees are often presented with the
   oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at
   the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an
   individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a
   tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry
   charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear
   to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the
   descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these
   formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular
   surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include
   all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which
   represents the reliance on marriage to link dynasties together.

   The passage of time can also be included to illustrate ancestry and
   descent. A time scale is often used, expanding radially across the center,
   divided into decades. Children of the parent form branches around the
   center and their names are plotted in their birth year on the time scale.
   Spouses' names join children's names and nuclear families of parents and
   children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are
   often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the
   natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there
   can be great great grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living
   relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear
   adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a
   living family tree.^[citation needed]

   The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse
   in medieval art,^[1] used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms
   of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical
   use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely
   patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods
   in Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium ("On the Genealogy of the Gods
   of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.^[2]

Common formats[edit]

   In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as
   a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and
   document ancestry and descent.

  Ahnentafel[edit]

   Main article: Ahnentafel

   Christoph, Graf von Zeil und Trauchburg

   An Ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table") is a genealogical numbering
   system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of
   ascent:

    1. Subject (or proband)
    2. Father
    3. Mother
    4. Paternal grandfather
    5. Paternal grandmother
    6. Maternal grandfather
    7. Maternal grandmother

   and so on, back through the generations. Apart from the subject or
   proband, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male,
   and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this scheme, the number of any
   person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is
   double the person's number plus one. This system can also be displayed as
   a tree:

                               4. Paternal grandfather
                      2. Father
                               5. Paternal grandmother
    1 Subject (or proband)
                               6. Maternal grandfather
                      3. Mother
                               7. Maternal grandmother

  Fan chart[edit]

   name cloud gramplet on the bottom

   A fan chart features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the
   subject is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each
   side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth.
   Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

Graph theory[edit]

   While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in
   general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since
   distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor
   on both their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must
   be born before their child, an individual cannot be their own ancestor,
   and thus there are no loops. In this regard, ancestry forms a directed
   acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent
   (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son
   relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry
   chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and
   one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on
   the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a
   person can have any number of children or none at all.

Notable examples[edit]

   [IMG]Family trees are an age-old phenomenon. This example dates from the
   sixteenth century.^[3]

   Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and
   cultures throughout the world.

  Africa[edit]

   In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from King
   Solomon via the Queen of Sheba. Through this claim, the family traced
   their descent back to the House of David.

   The genealogy of Ancient Egyptian ruling dynasties was recorded from the
   beginnings of the Pharaonic era c. 3000 BC to the end of the Ptolomaic
   Kingdom; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family
   lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

   Elsewhere in Africa, oral traditions of genealogical recording
   predominate. Members of the Keita dynasty of Mali, for example, have had
   their pedigrees sung by griots during annual ceremonies since the 14th
   century. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, many ruling clans—most notably those
   descended from Oduduwa—claim descent from the legendary King Kisra. Here
   too, pedigrees are recited by griots attached to the royal courts.^[4]

  The Americas[edit]

   In some pre-contact Native American civilizations, genealogical records of
   ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over
   several centuries or longer.

  East Asia[edit]

   There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but
   these do not form a single, unified family tree. Additionally, it is
   unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become
   mythological.

   In Japan, the ancestry of the Imperial Family is traced back to the
   mythological origins of Japan. The connection to persons from the
   established historical record only begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

   The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher
   and educator Confucius (551–479 BC), who is descended from King Tang
   (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and
   includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving
   more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and
   revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was
   printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation
   Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the
   Chinese thinker. This latest edition was expected to include some 1.3
   million living members who are scattered around the world today.^[5]

  Europe and West Asia[edit]

   Before the Dark Ages, in the Greco-Roman world, some reliable pedigrees
   dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first
   millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further.
   Roman clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure
   of their society and were the basis of their intricate system of personal
   names. However, there was a break in the continuity of record-keeping at
   the end of Classical Antiquity. Records of the lines of succession of the
   Popes and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have
   survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single
   families. Refer to descent from antiquity.

   Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West Asian origin can
   reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first
   millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity
   or mythological ancestors. In Europe, for example, the pedigree of Niall
   Noígíallach would be a contender for the longest, through Conn of the
   Hundred Battles (fl. 123 AD)^[citation needed]; in the legendary history
   of Ireland, he is further descended from Breogán, and ultimately from
   Adam, through the sons of Noah.

   Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which
   includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a
   13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and
   purportedly back to the legendary King David, as documented by Neil
   Rosenstein in his book The Lurie Legacy.^[6] The 1999 edition of the
   Guinness Book of Records recorded the Lurie family in the "longest
   lineage" category as one of the oldest-known living families in the world
   today.^[7]

   Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in
   religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent
   from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In
   the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical
   persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. Also according to
   the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed
   at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common
   Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the
   Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad
   greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new
   dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their
   legitimacy.

  Elsewhere[edit]

   Elsewhere, in many human cultures, clan and tribal associations are based
   on claims of common ancestry, although detailed documentation of those
   origins is often very limited.

  Global[edit]

   Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022,
   scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that
   unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history,
   ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for
   estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked
   trees along the genome, a tree-sequence,^[clarification needed] which has
   been described as the largest "human family tree".^[8]^[9]^[10]

Other uses[edit]

   The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced "family trees" of
   rock bands. In this instance, the entries represent a membership of
   certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family
   relationships. Several books have been produced with his family
   trees,^[11] which in turn have led to a BBC television series about them,
   including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.^[12]

   Another common use is in the creation of episcopal trees in Christian
   traditions that believe in apostolic succession. In this case, the
   connection is not made through blood, but through the order of succession
   of bishops.
