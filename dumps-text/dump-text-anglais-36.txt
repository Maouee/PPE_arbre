   In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices
   are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
   undirected graph.^[1] A forest is an undirected graph in which any two
   vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic
   undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.^[2]

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented
   forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a
   forest.

   The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer
   science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although
   such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be
   directed, called a directed rooted tree,^[8]^[9] either making all its
   edges point away from the root—in which case it is called an
   arborescence^[4]^[10] or out-tree^[11]^[12]—or making all its edges point
   towards the root—in which case it is called an anti-arborescence^[13] or
   in-tree.^[11]^[14] A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors
   as a directed graph.^[15]^[16]^[17] A rooted forest is a disjoint union of
   rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted
   forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each
   rooted tree—in which case it is called a branching or out-forest—or making
   all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree—in which case it
   is called an anti-branching or in-forest.

   The term tree was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur
   Cayley.^[18]

Definitions[edit]

  Tree[edit]

   A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following
   equivalent conditions:

     * G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
     * G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
     * G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is
       removed from G.
     * G is connected and the complete graph K_3 is not a minor of G.
     * Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.

   If G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements
   are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:

     * G is connected and has n − 1 edges.
     * G is connected, and every subgraph of G includes at least one vertex
       with zero or one incident edges. (That is, G is connected and
       1-degenerate.)
     * G has no simple cycles and has n − 1 edges.

   As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no
   vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously
   connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is
   not 0-connected (or even (−1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike
   non-empty trees, and violates the "one more vertex than edges" relation.
   It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.

   An internal vertex (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2.
   Similarly, an external vertex (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf)
   is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree
   at least 3.^[19]

   An irreducible tree (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is
   no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence A000014 in the OEIS).^[20]

  Forest[edit]

   A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
   at most one path. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected acyclic graph,
   all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph
   consists of a disjoint union of trees. As special cases, the order-zero
   graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless
   graph, are examples of forests. Since for every tree V − E = 1, we can
   easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting
   the difference between total vertices and total edges. TV − TE = number of
   trees in a forest.

  Polytree[edit]

   Main article: Polytree

   A polytree^[3] (or directed tree^[4] or oriented tree^[5]^[6] or singly
   connected network^[7]) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying
   undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed
   edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both
   connected and acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed tree" to the case where
   the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed
   away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).

  Polyforest[edit]

   A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic
   graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest. In other words, if we
   replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected
   graph that is acyclic.

   Some authors^[who?] restrict the phrase "directed forest" to the case
   where the edges of each connected component are all directed towards a
   particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see
   branching).

  Rooted tree[edit]

   A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the
   root.^[21] The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural
   orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the
   structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has
   an orientation away from the root, it is called an arborescence^[4] or
   out-tree;^[11] when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called
   an anti-arborescence or in-tree.^[11] The tree-order is the partial
   ordering on the vertices of a tree with u < v if and only if the unique
   path from the root to v passes through u. A rooted tree T that is a
   subgraph of some graph G is a normal tree if the ends of every T-path in G
   are comparable in this tree-order (Diestel 2005, p. 15). Rooted trees,
   often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at
   each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data
   structure.

   In a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any
   designated root is called a free tree.

   A labeled tree is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The
   vertices of a labeled tree on n vertices (for nonnegative integers n) are
   typically given the labels 1, 2, …, n. A recursive tree is a labeled
   rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if u < v
   for two vertices u and v, then the label of u is smaller than the label of
   v).

   In a rooted tree, the parent of a vertex v is the vertex connected to v on
   the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root
   has no parent.^[21] A child of a vertex v is a vertex of which v is the
   parent.^[21] An ascendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either the
   parent of v or is (recursively) an ascendant of a parent of v. A
   descendant of a vertex v is any vertex that is either a child of v or is
   (recursively) a descendant of a child of v. A sibling to a vertex v is any
   other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with v.^[21] A leaf is a
   vertex with no children.^[21] An internal vertex is a vertex that is not a
   leaf.^[21]

   The height of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest
   downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The height of the tree is the
   height of the root. The depth of a vertex is the length of the path to its
   root (root path). This^[clarification needed (This ___?)] is commonly
   needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees
   in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a
   tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has
   depth^[clarification needed (we've only defined depth of a vertex, not
   also the depth of the tree)] and height zero. Conventionally, an empty
   tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height
   −1.

   A k-ary tree (for nonnegative integers k) is a rooted tree in which each
   vertex has at most k children.^[22] 2-ary trees are often called binary
   trees, while 3-ary trees are sometimes called ternary trees.

  Ordered tree[edit]

   An ordered tree (alternatively, plane tree or positional tree^[23]) is a
   rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each
   vertex.^[21]^[24] This is called a "plane tree" because an ordering of the
   children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the
   root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex.
   Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction
   of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the
   children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing
   the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be
   drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.

Properties[edit]

     * Every tree is a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if
       it contains no cycles of odd length. Since a tree contains no cycles
       at all, it is bipartite.
     * Every tree with only countably many vertices is a planar graph.
     * Every connected graph G admits a spanning tree, which is a tree that
       contains every vertex of G and whose edges are edges of G. More
       specific types spanning trees, existing in every connected finite
       graph, include depth-first search trees and breadth-first search
       trees. Generalizing the existence of depth-first-search trees, every
       connected graph with only countably many vertices has a Trémaux
       tree.^[25] However, some uncountable-order graphs do not have such a
       tree.^[26]
     * Every finite tree with n vertices, with n > 1, has at least two
       terminal vertices (leaves). This minimal number of leaves is
       characteristic of path graphs; the maximal number, n − 1, is attained
       only by star graphs. The number of leaves is at least the maximum
       vertex degree.
     * For any three vertices in a tree, the three paths between them have
       exactly one vertex in common. More generally, a vertex in a graph that
       belongs to three shortest paths among three vertices is called a
       median of these vertices. Because every three vertices in a tree have
       a unique median, every tree is a median graph.
     * Every tree has a center consisting of one vertex or two adjacent
       vertices. The center is the middle vertex or middle two vertices in
       every longest path. Similarly, every n-vertex tree has a centroid
       consisting of one vertex or two adjacent vertices. In the first case
       removal of the vertex splits the tree into subtrees of fewer than n/2
       vertices. In the second case, removal of the edge between the two
       centroidal vertices splits the tree into two subtrees of exactly n/2
       vertices.
     * The maximal cliques of a tree are precisely its edges, implying that
       the class of trees has few cliques.

Enumeration[edit]

  Labeled trees[edit]

   Cayley's formula states that there are n^n−2 trees on n labeled vertices.
   A classic proof uses Prüfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger
   result: the number of trees with vertices 1, 2, …, n of degrees d_1, d_2,
   …, d_n respectively, is the multinomial coefficient

           {\displaystyle {n-2 \choose d_{1}-1,d_{2}-1,\ldots ,d_{n}-1}.}

   A more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph,
   which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem. (Cayley's formula is the
   special case of spanning trees in a complete graph.) The similar problem
   of counting all the subtrees regardless of size is #P-complete in the
   general case (Jerrum (1994)).

  Unlabeled trees[edit]

   Counting the number of unlabeled free trees is a harder problem. No closed
   formula for the number t(n) of trees with n vertices up to graph
   isomorphism is known. The first few values of t(n) are

           1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, …
           (sequence A000055 in the OEIS).

   Otter (1948) proved the asymptotic estimate

           {\displaystyle t(n)\sim C\alpha ^{n}n^{-5/2}\quad {\text{as }}n\to
           \infty ,}

   with C ≈ 0.534949606... and α ≈ 2.95576528565... (sequence A051491 in the
   OEIS). Here, the ~ symbol means that

           {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {t(n)}{C\alpha
           ^{n}n^{-5/2}}}=1.}

   This is a consequence of his asymptotic estimate for the number r(n) of
   unlabeled rooted trees with n vertices:

           r(n) \sim D\alpha^n n^{-3/2} \quad\text{as } n\to\infty,

   with D ≈ 0.43992401257... and the same α as above (cf. Knuth (1997), chap.
   2.3.4.4 and Flajolet & Sedgewick (2009), chap. VII.5, p. 475).

   The first few values of r(n) are^[27]

           1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, 12486, 32973, …
           (sequence A000081 in the OEIS).

Types of trees[edit]

     * A path graph (or linear graph) consists of n vertices arranged in a
       line, so that vertices i and i + 1 are connected by an edge for i = 1,
       …, n – 1.
     * A starlike tree consists of a central vertex called root and several
       path graphs attached to it. More formally, a tree is starlike if it
       has exactly one vertex of degree greater than 2.
     * A star tree is a tree which consists of a single internal vertex (and
       n – 1 leaves). In other words, a star tree of order n is a tree of
       order n with as many leaves as possible.
     * A caterpillar tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance
       1 of a central path subgraph.
     * A lobster tree is a tree in which all vertices are within distance 2
       of a central path subgraph.
     * A regular tree of degree d is the infinite tree with d edges at each
       vertex. These arise as the Cayley graphs of free groups, and in the
       theory of Tits buildings.

       number (n) of wires/resistors (branches), the number (m) of junctions
       (vertices), and the number (μ) of loops (faces) in the circuit. He
