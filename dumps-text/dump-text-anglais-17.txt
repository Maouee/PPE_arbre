   Eucalyptus are one of the state’s most controversial trees. A Monterey Bay
                reserve may be a model for how to replace them.

The Elkhorn Slough Reserve is pioneering methods to restore native habitats

   a.m.

   Fresh tree stumps the size of dining tables line the road at the Elkhorn
   Slough Reserve, the remains of hulking eucalyptus trees that blanketed the
   ground in a thick layer of aromatic wood chips. Nothing grows in the
   wreckage, but about 40 yards away, a grove of young oak trees flourishes.

   Mary Paul, a stewardship associate at the reserve just east of Moss
   Landing at the heart of the Monterey Bay, revels in the contrast. Where
   the oaks now stand, staff removed a 13-acre grove of eucalyptus in the
   1990s and planted well over 10,000 acorns. In a few decades, the roadside
   site where eucalyptus trees were cut down this summer should match the
   restored oak savanna beside it.

   Paul hopes the restoration efforts at Elkhorn Slough will help quell
   public opposition to the removal of the eucalyptus — an invasive tree
   native to Australia that has become a California icon, and a shelter for
   migrating birds and Monarch butterflies, but must be removed because they
   crowd out native species, increase fire risk and guzzle the state’s scarce
   water.

   “It’s not just about clear-cutting all the eucalyptus within the
   watershed, or even within the reserve — it’s about creating healthy
   ecosystems and healthy balance,” Paul said. “We are trying to balance
   everything.”

   Returning eucalyptus-choked landscapes to their original glory is a long
   and arduous process. It involves coaxing the barren earth back to life and
   dealing with thousands of tons of highly flammable wood.

   Also called blue gum, eucalyptus is a fast-growing tree native to
   Tasmania, an island state south of the Australian mainland. During the
   California Gold Rush of the 1800s, they were planted for windbreaks, fuel
   and timber. But when logs came out of the mill, the lumber was of poor
   quality, and many plantations were abandoned. Thousands of acres are left
   standing today.

   At the Elkhorn Slough Reserve — home to a vast array of birds, marine
   mammals, amphibians and fish — thirsty eucalyptus trees leave the wetlands
   more vulnerable to drought and problems with water quality. To save this
   vital habitat, the reserve has made removing the trees a priority in areas
   where they are doing harm.

   But some community members have objected. In 2015, when the Elkhorn Slough
   Reserve proposed chopping down more than 1,200 trees across 50 acres by
   2025, staff received angry comments from locals, many concerned that
   important Monarch butterfly and bird habitat would disappear.

   Similar objections have erupted around felling other eucalyptus groves,
   such as the removal of 31 trees on private land around Rodeo Creek in
   Santa Cruz, which was just completed. “I had no idea how much wildlife
   lived in the eucalyptus before I moved here,” said Santa Cruz resident
   Rebecca Wyatt, who opposed the move. “In the evening time before the sun
   goes down, it’s just magical — hundreds and hundreds of birds are diving
   in and out … but now, they’re homeless. It’s just heartbreaking.”

   Monarch butterflies migrating from the Rocky Mountains to California’s
   Central Coast every winter huddle in some eucalyptus groves for warmth.
   The reserve is also an important spot along the Pacific Flyway, a major
   bird migration route, where seabirds nest in eucalyptus groves and fatten
   up in the rich estuary habitat.

   “One of the ways that we addressed that concern was pointing out that we
   were going to leave active bird nesting and butterfly nesting habitat
   intact, in a part of the reserve where there’s a huge grove of eucalyptus
   trees,” Paul said, pointing to a dense stand in the distance, beside two
   stacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant. “We’re not going to remove that at
   all, ever.”

   At another restoration site where eucalyptus trees were downed in August
   2022, native plants sprout from holes in a foot-thick layer of eucalyptus
   wood chips. The scene challenges a common belief that eucalyptus is
   “allelopathic,” meaning it releases chemicals in the soil that make it
   difficult for other plants to grow. Scientists disagree on this, however,
   and no previous studies have looked at planting in eucalyptus mulch as
   Paul is doing on the reserve’s restoration sites.

   The thick layer of mulch blocks sunlight from reaching seeds of invasive
   weeds such as Italian thistle, poison hemlock and Cape ivy that would
   otherwise quickly take over.

   “Our personal experience on the reserve was that we did not see any
   effects of allelopathy on our native plants when we planted them with wood
   chips,” Paul said.

   To encourage only native plants to grow, Paul and her team dug pits into
   the eucalyptus mulch down to the soil layer and planted species grown in
   the reserve’s native nursery, including California goldenrod and creeping
   wild rye. The reserve plans to create a pond at the end of the catchment
   for endangered California red-legged frogs and California tiger
   salamanders, which rely on bodies of freshwater in the winter to breed.

   “There was a historic stream that was present on this site that hadn’t
   really been seen very much when the eucalyptus were here,” Paul said.
   After the trees were felled, the stream resurfaced during last winter’s
   storms.

   Even after creating wood chip mulch to help with restoration projects,
   thousands of tons of wood can be left behind after a eucalyptus grove is
   cut down. So Paul and her team have experimented with turning it into
   charcoal.

   After felling their first grove in 2018, Elkhorn Slough Reserve staff and
   volunteers chopped up the trunks and larger branches and built dozens of
   4-foot diameter burn piles, lighting them from the top-down to slowly
   “pyrolize” the wood into charcoal or “biochar”  — rather than burning it
   from the bottom-up into ash, which would release much more carbon into the
   air. They then buried some of the charcoal as part of an effort to restore
   a salt marsh, locking up the carbon the eucalyptus trees had sucked from
   the air over their lifetime.

   But this manual approach to making charcoal proved impractical. “That was
   such a labor-intensive process that we ended up stopping because we just
   didn’t have the capacity to do it anymore,” Paul said.

   The Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with the reserve,
   decided to automate the process after chopping down 8,000 tons of
   eucalyptus on 7 acres in 2021. Land acquisitions coordinator Kevin
   Contreras persuaded a contractor, Ventana Forestry, to buy a $500,000
   carbonator — a huge kiln the size of a shipping container that heats wood
   at temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Fahrenheit. After the carbonator
   went to work, the foundation was left with 215 tons of charcoal and a tiny
   pile of ash.

   This winter, Contreras is partnering with Arun Jani, assistant professor
   of crop management at CSU Monterey Bay, and Javier Zamora, an organic
   farmer at Triple M Ranch, to study whether charcoal mixed with compost
   will enhance crop growth. Since charcoal is porous and absorbent, it’s
   expected to hold moisture and create habitat for microbes in the soil that
   help plants grow.

   If the experiment is a success, selling charcoal to farmers could provide
   a stream of income to help offset the cost of eucalyptus removal. The
   Elkhorn Slough Foundation wants to remove another 100 acres of eucalyptus
   on its land, an undertaking Contreras says will cost upwards of $2
   million.

   “If we’re going to tackle eucalyptus on a statewide basis, we need to be
   able to drive the cost of these projects down,” he said.
