   [IMG]A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia [IMG]The original Encyclopédie (1752) used a tree diagram to
   show the way in which its subjects were ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the
   hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a
   "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree,
   with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are
   listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member
   is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting node. But the
   converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root
   node.

   The names of relationships between nodes model the kinship terminology of
   family relations. The gender-neutral names "parent" and "child" have
   largely displaced the older "father" and "son" terminology. The term
   "uncle" is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the
   parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms like
   "ommer".^[1]

     * A node's "parent" is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e.
       closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
     * "Sibling" ("brother" or "sister") nodes share the same parent node.
     * A node's "uncles" (sometimes "ommers") are siblings of that node's
       parent.
     * A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an
       "ancestor". The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of the
       ancestor node.

   In the example, "encyclopedia" is the parent of "science" and "culture",
   its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children of "culture",
   which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also,
   "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of "science",
   "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and "craft", as
   leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a
   language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example
   being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase,
   with each in turn having other components which have other components),
   the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees
   of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the
   Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any
   other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

   For a formal definition see set theory, and for a generalization in which
   children are not necessarily successors, see prefix order.

Representing trees[edit]

   There are many ways of visually representing tree structures. Almost
   always, these boil down to variations, or combinations, of a few basic
   styles:

  Classical node-link diagrams[edit]

   Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line
   segments:

   encyclopedia
   /         \       
   culture   science 
   /   \     
   art craft 

  Nested sets[edit]

   Nested sets that use enclosure or containment to show parenthood; examples
   include TreeMaps, fractal maps, and Euler diagrams:

   [IMG]   encyclopedia  
   [IMG]                 [IMG]  
   [IMG] culture                
   [IMG]         [IMG] science 
   art   craft         

  Layered "icicle" diagrams[edit]

   Layered "icicle" diagrams that use alignment/adjacency.

   +-----------------------+
   | encyclopedia          |
   |-----------------------|
   | culture     | science |
   |-------------+---------|
   | art | craft |         |
   +-----------------------+

  Outlines and tree views[edit]

   Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called "outlines" or
   "tree views".

   An outline:

           encyclopedia

                        culture

                                     art
                                     craft

                        science

   A tree view:

     * encyclopedia
          * culture
               * art
               * craft
          * science

  Nested parentheses[edit]

   See also: Newick format and Dyck language

   A correspondence to nested parentheses was first noticed by Sir Arthur
   Cayley:

   ((art,craft)culture,science)encyclopedia
   or
   encyclopedia(culture(art,craft),science)

  Radial trees[edit]

   See also: Radial tree

   Trees can also be represented radially:

   art     craft 
         \ /     
   culture 
   |       
   encyclopedia
   |       
   science
