   Way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a
   graphical form
   This article includes a list of general references, but it lacks
   sufficient corresponding inline citations. Please help to improve this
   article by introducing more precise citations. (July 2014) (Learn how

   [300px-Binary_tree_structure.svg.png] A tree structure showing the
   possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia[300px-ENC_SYSTEME_FIGURE.jpeg] The original Encyclopédie
   (1752) used a tree diagram to show the way in which its subjects were
   ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing
   the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named
   a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological
   tree, with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles
   are listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This
   member is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting
   node. But the converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may
   not have a root node.

   The names of relationships between nodes model the kinship terminology
   of family relations. The gender-neutral names "parent" and "child" have
   largely displaced the older "father" and "son" terminology. The term
   "uncle" is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the
   parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms
   like "ommer".^[1]
     * A node's "parent" is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e.
       closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
     * "Sibling" ("brother" or "sister") nodes share the same parent node.
     * A node's "uncles" (sometimes "ommers") are siblings of that node's
       parent.
     * A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an
       "ancestor". The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of
       the ancestor node.

   In the example, "encyclopedia" is the parent of "science" and
   "culture", its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children
   of "culture", which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors.
   Also, "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of
   "science", "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and
   "craft", as leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree
   of a language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key
   example being S -> NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a
   verb phrase, with each in turn having other components which have other
   components), the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site,
   mathematical trees of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of
   the Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to
   any other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

   For a formal definition see set theory, and for a generalization in
   which children are not necessarily successors, see prefix order.

Representing trees[edit]

   There are many ways of visually representing tree structures. Almost
   always, these boil down to variations, or combinations, of a few basic
   styles:

Classical node-link diagrams[edit]

   Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line
   segments:
           encyclopedia
   /
   culture \
   science
   /
   art \
   craft

Nested sets[edit]

   Nested sets that use enclosure or containment to show parenthood;
   examples include TreeMaps, fractal maps, and Euler diagrams:
   [Blank.png] encyclopedia
   [Blank.png] [Blank.png]
   [Blank.png] culture
   [Blank.png]         [Blank.png]
            art   craft
   science

Layered "icicle" diagrams[edit]

   Layered "icicle" diagrams that use alignment/adjacency.
     encyclopedia
   culture   science
   art craft

Outlines and tree views[edit]

   Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called "outlines" or
   "tree views".

   An outline:

          encyclopedia

                culture

                      art
                      craft

                science

   A tree view:
     * encyclopedia
          + culture
               o art
               o craft
          + science

Nested parentheses[edit]

   See also: Newick format and Dyck language

   A correspondence to nested parentheses was first noticed by Sir Arthur
   Cayley:

   ((art,craft)culture,science)encyclopedia
   or
   encyclopedia(culture(art,craft),science)

Radial trees[edit]

   See also: Radial tree

   Trees can also be represented radially:
   art
         \ craft
   /
   culture
   |
           encyclopedia
   |
   science
