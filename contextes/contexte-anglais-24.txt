   The html package provides an HTML5-compliant tokenizer and parser for
   parsing and manipulating HTML documents, traversing the parse tree, and
   manipulating the tree structure. The html package is a built-in package of
   Goâ€™s standard library.

   One of the main features of the html package is the Parse function that
   can parse HTML documents and return the root node of the parse tree, from
   where you can use functions like the FirstChild and NextSibling to
   navigate the tree and extract information from the document. The package
   also provides the ParseFragment function for parsing fragments of HTML
   documents.
