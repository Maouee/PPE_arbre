   [IMG]A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an
   encyclopedia [IMG]The original Encyclopédie (1752) used a tree diagram to
   show the way in which its subjects were ordered.

   A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the
   hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a
   "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree,
   although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree,
   with the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

   A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a
   discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data
   structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory,
   see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are
   listed below.

Terminology and properties[edit]

   The tree elements are called "nodes". The lines connecting elements are
   called "branches". Nodes without children are called leaf nodes,
   "end-nodes", or "leaves".

   Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member
   is called the "root" or root node. The root is the starting node. But the
   converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root
   node.

   its children. "Art" and "craft" are siblings, and children of "culture",
   which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also,
   "encyclopedia", as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of "science",
   "culture", "art" and "craft". Finally, "science", "art" and "craft", as
   leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

   Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as
   family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a
   language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example
   being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase,
   with each in turn having other components which have other components),
   the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees
   of integer sets, et cetera.

   The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms "tree
   structure" and "tree-diagram" from 1965 in Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the
   Theory of Syntax.^[2]

   In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any
   other point.

   Computer science uses tree structures extensively (see Tree (data
   structure) and telecommunications.)

Representing trees[edit]

   There are many ways of visually representing tree structures. Almost
   always, these boil down to variations, or combinations, of a few basic
   styles:

  Outlines and tree views[edit]

   Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called "outlines" or
   "tree views".

   Trees can also be represented radially:
