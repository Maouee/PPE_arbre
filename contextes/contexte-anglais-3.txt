   [IMG]A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
   [IMG]It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon
   men's hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that
   emanates from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary
   spirit. ~ Robert Louis Stevenson [IMG]The earth brought forth vegetation,
   plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit
   in which is their seed, according to its kind. And God saw that it was
   good. ~ Genesis 1:12.

   Trees are plants with elongated stems, or trunks, supporting leaves or
   branches. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always
   been revered and they play a role in much of the world's mythology,
   metaphor and symbolism.

   [IMG]A birch tree doesn't feel cosmic fulfillment when a moose munches its
   leaves; the tree species, in fact,it needs and evolves to fight the moose,
   to keep the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and
   twigs. - Robert T. Bakker

       leaves; the tree species, in fact, evolves to fight the moose, to keep
       the animal's munching lips away from vulnerable young leaves and

       will favor the birch genes that make the tree less and less palatable
       to the moose in generation after generation. No plant species could
       survive for long by offering itself as unprotected fodder.

       of the past - a medlar and a mulberry. This last is not a beautiful
       tree. It covers itself with such dense masses of heavy foliage; its
       form has neither grace nor dignity - and yet we love it.

            (April, 1899).
     * O, the mulberry-tree is of trees the queen!

   Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees.
   Three centuries he grows, and three he stays
   Supreme in state; and in three more decays.
