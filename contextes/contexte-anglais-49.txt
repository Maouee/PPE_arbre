   Trees

   A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or
   as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data
   structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections
   between elements, giving a tree graph.

   Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of
   trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices.

   A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends
   containing no closed loops (cycles). In other words, it is a simple,
   undirected, connected, acyclic graph (or, equivalently, a connected
   forest). A tree with n nodes has n-1 graph edges. Conversely, a connected
   graph with n nodes and n-1 edges is a tree. All trees are bipartite graphs
   (Skiena 1990, p. 213). Trees with no particular node singled out are
   sometimes called free trees (or unrooted tree), by way of distinguishing
   them from rooted trees (Skiena 1990, Knuth 1997).

   The points of connection are known as forks and the segments as branches.
   Final segments and the nodes at their ends are called tree leaves. A tree
   with two branches at each fork and with one or two tree leaves at the end
   of each branch is called a binary tree.

   A graph can be tested in the Wolfram Language to see if it is a tree using
   TreeGraphQ[g].

   Trees are block graphs.

   A tree T has either one node that is a graph center, in which case it is
   called a centered tree, or two adjacent nodes that are graph centers, in
   which case it is called a bicentered tree (Harary 1994, p. 35).

   When a special node is designated to turn a tree into a rooted tree, it is
   called the root (or sometimes "Eve"). In such a tree, each of the nodes
   that is one graph edge further away from a given node is called a child,
   and nodes connected to the same node that are the same distance from the

   Note that two branches placed end-to-end are equivalent to a single
   branch, which means for example, that there is only one tree of order 3.
   The number t(n) of nonisomorphic trees of order n=1, 2, ... (where trees
   of orders 1, 2, ..., 6 are illustrated above), are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11,
   23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159, ... (OEIS A000055).

   The generating functions for the number of rooted trees

                  T(x) =  sum_(n=1)^(infty)T_nx^n                         (1) 
                       =  xexp[sum_(r=1)^(infty)1/rT(x^r)]                (2) 

   is related to the generating function for the number of unrooted trees
   t(x) by

   If t_n is the number of nonisomorphic trees on n nodes, then an asymptotic
   series for t_n is given by
