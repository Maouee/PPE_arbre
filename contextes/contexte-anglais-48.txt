   What a phylogenetic tree is. How to read phylogenetic trees and determine
   which species are most related.

Key points:

     * A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that represents evolutionary
       relationships among organisms. Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, not
       definitive facts.
     * The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species
       or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors.
     * In trees, two species are more related if they have a more recent
       common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common
       ancestor.
     * Phylogenetic trees can be drawn in various equivalent styles. Rotating
       a tree about its branch points doesn't change the information it
       carries.

   in ways that reflect our understanding of how they evolved from their
   common ancestors.
   In this article, we'll take a look at phylogenetic trees, diagrams that
   represent evolutionary relationships among organisms. We'll see exactly
   what we can (and can't!) infer from a phylogenetic tree, as well as what
   it means for organisms to be more or less related in the context of these
   trees.

Anatomy of a phylogenetic tree

   When we draw a phylogenetic tree, we are representing our best hypothesis
   about how a set of species (or other groups) evolved from a common
   ancestor1‍ . As we'll explore further in the article on building trees,
   this hypothesis is based on information we’ve collected about our set of
   species – things like their physical features and the DNA sequences of
   their genes.
   [Are phylogenetic trees only for species?]
   In a phylogenetic tree, the species or groups of interest are found at the
   tips of lines referred to as the tree's branches. For example, the
   phylogenetic tree below represents relationships between five species, A,
   B, C, D, and E, which are positioned at the ends of the branches:
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first

   The pattern in which the branches connect represents our understanding of
   how the species in the tree evolved from a series of common ancestors.
   Each branch point (also called an internal node) represents a divergence
   event, or splitting apart of a single group into two descendant groups.
--
   giving rise to species A and B, we would find the most recent common
   ancestor of those two species. At the branch point right above the root of
   the tree, we would find the most recent common ancestor of all the species
   in the tree (A, B, C, D, E).
   [Why is this the most recent common ancestor of all the species?]
   A horizontal phylogenetic tree. Ancestors are on the left with present-day
   species on the right. Branches are designated as a straight line, and
   branch points are shown as a vertical line connecting two branches. Five
   species of interest are designated by letters A, B, C, D, and E labeled
   branches on the right side of the tree. The tree begins with one line on
   the left, labeled root, which branches (at a branch point) to form species
   E and another line that branches into a pair of double branches. From
   there, the first pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the
   second pair of double branches forms species C and D. The first branch
   point in the tree is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A, B, C, D,
   and E. The point where the tree branches into species A and B is labeled
   Most recent common ancestor of A and B.

   Each horizontal line in our tree represents a series of ancestors, leading
   up to the species at its end. For instance, the line leading up to species
   E represents the species' ancestors since it diverged from the other
   species in the tree. Similarly, the root represents a series of ancestors
   leading up to the most recent common ancestor of all the species in the
   tree.

Which species are more related?

   In a phylogenetic tree, the relatedness of two species has a very specific
   meaning. Two species are more related if they have a more recent common
   ancestor, and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.
--
   ancestor of any pair or group of species. In this method, we start at the
   branch ends carrying the two species of interest and “walk backwards” in
   the tree until we find the point where the species’ lines converge.
   For instance, suppose that we wanted to say whether A and B or B and C are
   more closely related. To do so, we would follow the lines of both pairs of
   species backward in the tree. Since A and B converge at a common ancestor
   first as we move backwards, and B only converges with C after its junction
   point with A, we can say that A and B are more related than B and C.

   the left, which branches (at a branch point) to form species E and another
   line that branches into a pair of double branches. From there, the first
   pair of double branches forms species A and B, while the second pair of
   double branches forms species C and D. The point where the tree branches
   into species A and B is labeled Most recent common ancestor of A and B. A
   pink line traces from species A back to this point, while a red line
   traces from species B back to this point. The point where the tree
   branches into a pair of double branches is labeled Most recent common
   ancestor of B and C. A red line traces from species B back to this point,
--
   using this method. For instance, we can't say whether A and B are more
   closely related than C and D. That’s because, by default, the horizontal
   axis of the tree doesn't represent time in a direct way. So, we can only
   compare the timing of branching events that occur on the same lineage
   (same direct line from the root of the tree), and not those that occur on
   different lineages.

Some tips for reading phylogenetic trees

   You may see phylogenetic trees drawn in many different formats. Some are
   blocky, like the tree at left below. Others use diagonal lines, like the
   tree at right below. You may also see trees of either kind oriented
   vertically or flipped on their sides, as shown for the blocky tree.
   Three examples of phylogenetic trees. The first tree is horizontal with a
   root on the left and branches forming 90 degree angles before forming
   species on the right hand side. The second tree is similar to the first
   tree, but it is vertical, with the root at the bottom and the species
   listed at the top. The third tree is similar to the second tree, but the
   branches are diagonal.
   Image modified from Taxonomy and phylogeny: Figure 2 by Robert Bear et
   al., CC BY 4.0
   The three trees above represent identical relationships among species A,
   B, C, D, and E. You may want to take a moment to convince yourself that
   this is really the case – that is, that no branching patterns or
   recent-ness of common ancestors are different between the two trees. The
   identical information in these different-looking trees reminds us that
   it's the branching pattern (and not the lengths of branches) that's
   meaningful in a typical tree.
   Another critical point about these trees is that if you rotate the
   structures, using one of the branch points as a pivot, you don’t change
   the relationships. So just like the two trees above, which show the same
   relationships even though they are formatted differently, all of the trees
   below show the same relationships among four species:
   A series of vertical phylogenetic trees showing that phylogenetic trees
   can be rotated at a branch, resulting in the same tree. Numbers will be
   assigned to the branches for description, but do not appear in the
   diagram. The first tree begins with a root at the bottom, which splits
   into branches 1 and 2. Branch 1 becomes species W. Branch 2 splits into
   branches 3 and 4. Branch 3 becomes species X. Branch 4 splits into
   branches 5 and 6, which becomes species Y and Z respectively. The species
   are listed from left to right as W, X, Y, and Z. If branch 2 is rotated
   horizontally 180 degrees it results in the same tree, although the species
   are listed from left to right as W, Z, Y, and X. At the bottom of the
   diagram four equal trees are shown, but with rotations occurring at
   different branches.

   diagrams. That ordering actually doesn’t give us useful information.
   Instead, it’s the branch structure of each diagram that tells us what we
   need to understand the tree.
   So far, all the trees we've looked at have had nice, clean branching
   patterns, with just two lineages (lines of descent) emerging from each
   branch point. However, you may see trees with a polytomy (poly, many;
   tomy, cuts), meaning a branch point that has three or more different
   species coming off of it2‍ . In general, a polytomy shows where we don't
   have enough information to determine branching order.

   becomes species U and an upper branch that further splits into two
   branches. The bottom branch splits into two branches, forming species S

   al., CC BY 4.0
   If we later get more information about the species in a tree, we may be
   able to resolve a polytomy using the new information.

Where do these trees come from?

   To generate a phylogenetic tree, scientists often compare and analyze many
   characteristics of the species or other groups involved. These
   characteristics can include external morphology (shape/appearance),
   internal anatomy, behaviors, biochemical pathways, DNA and protein
   sequences, and even the characteristics of fossils.
   To build accurate, meaningful trees, biologists will often use many
   different characteristics (reducing the chances of any one imperfect piece
   of data leading to a wrong tree). Still, phylogenetic trees are
   hypotheses, not definitive answers, and they can only be as good as the
   data available when they're made. Trees are revised and updated over time
--
   particularly true today, as DNA sequencing increases our ability to
   compare genes between species.
   In the next article on building a tree, we’ll see concrete examples of how
   different types of data are used to organize species into phylogenetic
   trees.

            The most accurate phylogenetic tree will have the fewest nodes.
            It's something called parsimony which means that the best tree is
            the simplest.
