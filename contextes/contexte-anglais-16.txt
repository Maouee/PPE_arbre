   A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart
   representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More
   detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as
   genograms.

--

   Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example, as a
   pedigree or ancestry chart. Family trees are often presented with the
   oldest generations at the top of the tree and the younger generations at
   the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an
   individual and not all members of a family, will more closely resemble a
   tree in shape, being wider at the top than at the bottom. In some ancestry
   charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear
   to the right. Conversely, a descendant chart, which depicts all the
   descendants of an individual, will be narrowest at the top. Beyond these
   formats, some family trees might include all members of a particular
   surname (e.g., male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to include
   all holders of a certain office, such as the Kings of Germany, which
--
   children branch off to grandchildren, and so on. Great-grandparents are
   often in the center to portray four or five generations, which reflect the
   natural growth pattern of a tree as seen from the top but sometimes there
   can be great great grandparents or more. In a descendant tree, living
   relatives are common on the outer branches and contemporary cousins appear
   adjacent to each other. Privacy should be considered when preparing a
   living family tree.^[citation needed]

   The image of the tree probably originated with that of the Tree of Jesse
   in medieval art,^[1] used to illustrate the Genealogy of Christ in terms
   of a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-biblical
   use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely
   patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods
   in Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium ("On the Genealogy of the Gods
   of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.^[2]
--

   In addition to familiar representations of family history and genealogy as
   a tree structure, there are other notable systems used to illustrate and
   document ancestry and descent.

   person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is
   double the person's number plus one. This system can also be displayed as
   a tree:

Graph theory[edit]

   While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in
   general form a tree in the strict sense used in graph theory, since
   distant relatives can mate. Therefore, a person can have a common ancestor
   on both their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must
--
   acyclic graph. Nevertheless, graphs depicting matrilineal descent
   (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son
   relationships) do form trees. Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry
   chart is a perfect binary tree, as each person has exactly one mother and
   one father; these thus have a regular structure. A Descendant chart, on
   the other hand, does not, in general, have a regular structure, as a
--
Notable examples[edit]

   [IMG]Family trees are an age-old phenomenon. This example dates from the
   sixteenth century.^[3]

   Family trees have been used to document family histories across time and
   cultures throughout the world.

--

   There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but
   these do not form a single, unified family tree. Additionally, it is
   unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become
   mythological.
--
   established historical record only begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

   The longest family tree in the world is that of the Chinese philosopher
   and educator Confucius (551–479 BC), who is descended from King Tang
   (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him and
   includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving
   more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and
   revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was
   printed in September 2009 by the Confucius Genealogy Compilation
   Committee, to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the
--
   Adam, through the sons of Noah.

   Another very old and extensive tree is that of the Lurie lineage—which
   includes Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber—and traces back to Lurie, a
   13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to Rashi and
--
   today.^[7]

   Family trees and representations of lineages are also important in
   religious traditions. The biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent
   from the House of David, covering a period of approximately 1000 years. In
--
   the Torah, the Kohanim are descended from Aaron. Genetic testing performed
   at the Technion has shown that most modern Kohanim share common
   Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the
   Kohanim. In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad
   greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders; new

  Global[edit]

   Forms of family trees are also used in genetic genealogy. In 2022,
   scientists reported the largest detailed human genetic genealogy, that
   unifies human genomes from many sources for insights about human history,
   ancestry and evolution and demonstrates a novel computational method for
   estimating how human DNA is related via a series of 13 million linked
   trees along the genome, a tree-sequence,^[clarification needed] which has
   been described as the largest "human family tree".^[8]^[9]^[10]

Other uses[edit]

   The author Pete Frame is notable for having produced "family trees" of
   rock bands. In this instance, the entries represent a membership of
   certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family
   relationships. Several books have been produced with his family
   trees,^[11] which in turn have led to a BBC television series about them,
   including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.^[12]

   Another common use is in the creation of episcopal trees in Christian
   traditions that believe in apostolic succession. In this case, the
   connection is not made through blood, but through the order of succession
