‘Assisted migration’ means humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could migrate on
their own

   Douglas fir trees that died as a result of insect damage following heat
   stress are visible in the Willamette National Forest, Ore., Friday, Oct.
   27, 2023. As native trees in the Pacific Northwest die off due to climate
   change, the U.S. Forest Service and others are turning to a strategy
   called "assisted migration."

   The idea is that humans can help trees keep up with climate change by
   moving them to more favorable ecosystems faster than the trees could
   migrate on their own.

   In the Pacific Northwest, a divide has emerged between groups advocating
   for assisted migration that would help struggling native trees, and one
   that could instead see native species replaced on the landscape by trees
   from the south, including coast redwoods and giant sequoias.

   migration is the possibility that native caterpillars might not eat the
   leaves of migrated nonnative tree species. Because caterpillars feed birds
   and other animals, this could lead to disruptions to the food web.

Portland’s experimentation with assisted migration of trees

   The city of Portland’s Urban Forestry program is currently experimenting
   with the assisted migration of 11 tree species, including three oak
   species to the south: California black oak, canyon live oak and interior
   live oak.

   Another advocate for species migration is the Puget Sound-based,
   citizen-led PropagationNation. The organization has planted trees in
   several parks in the Seattle area and has the ambitious goal of “bringing
   a million coast redwoods and giant sequoias to the Northwest,” according

   David Milarch, founder of the Michigan-based Archangel Ancient Tree
   Archive, which has supplied PropagationNation with redwoods and sequoias,
   says his trees aren’t intended to replace Pacific Northwest native
   species.

   “All we are doing is extending the range (of redwoods and sequoias) north
   in the hopes that they will still be here in 100 to 200 years and not join
   the list of trees that are going extinct,” said Milarch.

Widespread assisted migration may be risky, Forest Service says
