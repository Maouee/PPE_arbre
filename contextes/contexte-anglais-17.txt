   American family decorating Christmas tree (c. 1970s)

   A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such
   as a spruce, pine or fir, or an artificial tree of similar appearance,
   associated with the celebration of Christmas.^[1]

   The custom was developed in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia), where Protestant
   Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.^[2]^[3]^[4] The tree
   was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples,
   wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".^[2] Moravian Christians began to
   illuminate Christmas trees with candles,^[5] which were often replaced by
   Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.^[6] Today, there is
   a wide variety of traditional and modern ornaments, such as garlands,
   baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or star might be placed at the
   top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem,
   respectively, from the Nativity.^[7]^[8] Edible items such as gingerbread,
   chocolate, and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from
   the tree's branches with ribbons. The Christmas tree has been historically
   regarded as a custom of the Lutheran Churches and only in 1982 did the
   Catholic Church erect the Vatican Christmas Tree.^[9]

   In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected
   on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve
   depending on the country;^[10] customs of the same faith hold that the two
   traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree,
   are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day,
   Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some
   denominations.^[10]^[11]

   The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the "Yule-tree", especially
   in discussions of its folkloric origins.^[12]^[13]^[14]

History[edit]

  Origin of the modern Christmas tree[edit]

   [IMG]Martin Luther is depicted with his family and friends in front of a
   Christmas tree on Christmas Eve

   Modern Christmas trees originated in Central Europe and the Baltic states,
   particularly Estonia, Germany and Livonia (now Latvia) during the
   Renaissance in early modern Europe.^[2]^[3] Its 16th-century origins are
   sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who
   is said to have first added lighted candles to an evergreen
   tree.^[15]^[16]^[17] The Christmas tree was first recorded to be used by
   German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a
   Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1539, under
   the leadership of the Protestant Reformer Martin Bucer.^[18]^[19] The
   Moravian Christians put lighted candles on those trees."^[5]^[20] The
   earliest known firmly dated representation of a Christmas tree is on the
   keystone sculpture of a private home in Turckheim, Alsace (then part of
   the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, today France), with the date
--
  Possible predecessors[edit]

   Modern Christmas trees have been related to the "tree of paradise" of
   medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration
   and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree
   decorated with apples (representing fruit from the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil and thus to the original sin that Christ took away) and
   round white wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as
   a setting for the play.^[6] Like the Christmas crib, the Paradise tree was
   later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as
   shiny red balls.^[13]^[14]^[22]^[23]^[24]^[25]

     Fir trees decorated with apples served as the central prop for the
     paradise play, a kind of folk religious drama often performed on
     December 24 These props were called paradise trees, and some researchers
     believe they were the forerunners of the Christmas tree

   Portugal. The Regiment of the local high-Sacristans of the Cistercian
   Order refers to what may be considered the oldest references to the
   Christmas tree: "Note on how to put the Christmas branch, scilicet: On the
   Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you
   shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of
--
   the candle of the high altar."^[27]

   [IMG]Yggdrasil, in Norse cosmology, is an immense and central sacred tree.

   Other sources have offered a connection between the symbolism of the first
   documented Christmas trees in Germany around 1600 and the trees of
   pre-Christian traditions, though this claim has been disputed.^[28]
   According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, "The use of evergreen trees,
   wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the
   ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the
   pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the
   Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at
   the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the
   birds during Christmas time."^[29]

   It is commonly believed that ancient Romans used to decorate their houses
   with evergreen trees to celebrate Saturnalia,^[30] although there are no
   historical records of that.^[31] In the poem Epithalamium by Catullus, he
   tells of the gods decorating the home of Peleus with trees, including
   laurel and cypress. Later Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom speak of
   the use of evergreen trees to adorn Christian houses.^[32]

   The Vikings and Saxons worshiped trees.^[30] The story of Saint Boniface
   cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century
   among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that
   an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how
   its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to
   heaven.^[33]^[a]

   Customs of erecting decorated trees in winter time can be traced to
   Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era guilds in Northern Germany and
   Livonia. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas
   Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the
   apprentices and children. In Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia), in
   1441, 1442, 1510, and 1514, the Brotherhood of Blackheads erected a tree
   for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now Tallinn) and Riga. On
   the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree
   was taken to the Town Hall Square, where the members of the brotherhood
   danced around it.^[34]

   A Bremen guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with
   "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels, and paper flowers" was erected in the
   guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected
--
   established tradition of setting up a decorated spruce at the market
   square, where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first
   sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

   After the Protestant Reformation, such trees are seen in the houses of
   upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic Christmas
   cribs. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes

   tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the

    Adoption by European nobility[edit]

   [IMG]German Christmas tree, book illustration (1888)

   In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility
   and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Introduced by Fanny von
   Arnstein and popularized by Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg the
   Christmas tree reached Vienna in 1814 during the Congress of Vienna, and
   the custom spread across Austria in the following years.^[41] In France,
   the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchesse d'Orléans.
   In Denmark, a newspaper company claims that the first attested Christmas
   tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the
   aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to
   the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1865. He had published a
   fairy tale called The Fir-Tree in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir tree
   being used as a Christmas tree.^[42]

      Germany[edit]

   Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas
   tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained
   confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The
   custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way
--
   Vienna.

   In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of
   German culture and of Gemütlichkeit, especially among emigrants
   overseas.^[43]

   A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's
   decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals
   during the Franco-Prussian War. Only at the start of the 20th century did
   Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit
   form.^[44]

--

   Early Slovenian custom dating back to around the 17th century was to
   suspend the tree either upright or upside-down above the well, a corner of
   the dinner table, in the backyard, or from the fences, modestly decorated
   with fruits or not decorated at all. German brewer Peter Luelsdorf brought
   the first Christmas tree of the current tradition to Slovenia in 1845. He
   set it up in his small brewery inn in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital.
   German officials, craftsmen and merchants quickly spread the tradition
   among the bourgeois population. The trees were typically decorated with
   walnuts, golden apples, carobs, and candles. At first the Catholic
   majority rejected this custom because they considered it a typical
--
   in Ljubljana already in 1859. However, this tradition was almost unknown
   to the rural population until World War I, after which everyone started
   decorating trees. Spruce trees have a centuries-long tradition in
   Slovenia. After World War II during Yugoslavia period, trees set in the
   public places (towns, squares, and markets) were politically replaced with
   fir trees, a symbol of socialism and Slavic mythology strongly associated
   with loyalty, courage, and dignity. However, spruce retained its
   popularity in Slovenian homes during those years and came back to public

   [IMG]An engraving published in the 1840s of Queen Victoria and Prince
   Albert created a craze for Christmas trees.^[49]

   Although the tradition of decorating churches and homes with evergreens at
   Christmas was long established,^[50] the custom of decorating an entire
   small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. The
   German-born Queen Charlotte introduced a Christmas tree at a party she
   gave for children in 1800.^[51] The custom did not at first spread much
   beyond the royal family.^[b] Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with
   it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. In her journal for
   Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote:^[53]

     After dinner [...] we then went into the drawing room near the dining
     room [...] There were two large round tables on which were placed two
     trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being
     placed round the trees [...]

   After Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the
   custom became even more widespread^[54] as wealthier middle-class families
   followed the fashion. In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes
   clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and
   gift-giving.^[55] An illustrated book, The Christmas Tree, describing
--
   seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in
   the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the
   Christmas trees is not less than ours used to be".^[59] A boost to the
   trend was given in 1848^[60] when The Illustrated London News,^[61] in a
   report picked up by other papers,^[62] described the trees in Windsor
   Castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family,
   on its cover. In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was
   widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert
   alluding casually to them,^[63] as well as reporting the accidental death
   of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas
   tree.^[64] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a
   report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every
   family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still
   the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".^[65]

   them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up
   specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums "who had never
   seen a Christmas tree" would enjoy one that year.^[66] Anti-German
   sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity^[67] but the
   effect was short-lived,^[68] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas
   trees had spread to all classes.^[69] In 1933 a restriction on the
   importation of foreign trees led to the "rapid growth of a new industry"
   as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially
   viable due to the size of demand.^[70] By 2013 the number of trees grown
   in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately eight million^[71]

      The Bahamas[edit]

   The earliest reference of Christmas trees being used in The Bahamas dates
   to January 1864 and is associated with the Anglican Sunday Schools in
   Nassau, New Providence: "After prayers and a sermon from the Rev. R.
   Swann, the teachers and children of St. Agnes', accompanied by those of
   St. Mary's, marched to the Parsonage of Rev. J. H. Fisher, in front of
   which a large Christmas tree had been planted for their gratification. The
   delighted little ones formed a circle around it singing "Come follow me to
   the Christmas tree"."^[74] The gifts decorated the trees as ornaments and
   the children were given tickets with numbers that matched the gifts. This
   appears to be the typical way of decorating the trees in the 1860s
   Bahamas. In the Christmas of 1864, there was a Christmas tree put up in
   the Ladies Saloon in the Royal Victoria Hotel for the respectable children
   of the neighbourhood. The tree was ornamented with gifts for the children
   who formed a circle about it and sung the song "Oats and Beans". The gifts
   were later given to the children in the name of Santa Claus.^[75]

   Riedesel and his wife, the Baroness von Riedesel, held a Christmas party
   for the officers at Sorel, Quebec, delighting their guests with a fir tree
   decorated with candles and fruits.^[76]

   The Christmas tree became very common in the United States of America in
   the early nineteenth century. Dating from late 1812 or early 1813, the
   watercolor sketchbooks of John Lewis Krimmel contain perhaps the earliest
   depictions of a Christmas tree in American art, representing a family
   celebrating Christmas Eve in the Moravian tradition.^[77] The first
   published image of a Christmas tree appeared in 1836 as the frontispiece
   to The Stranger's Gift by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the
   Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition
   of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, titled "New Year's Day", by Catherine
   Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her
   mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British royal family with their
   Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in The Illustrated
   London News December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas
   1850, in Godey's Lady's Book. Godey's copied it exactly, except for the
--
   engraving into an American scene.^[78] The republished Godey's image
   became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen
   Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince
   Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, "the first
   influential American Christmas tree".^[79] Folk-culture historian Alfred
   Lewis Shoemaker states, "In all of America there was no more important
   medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than Godey's
   Lady's Book". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting
   up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.^[78]

   President Benjamin Harrison and his wife Caroline put up the first White
   House Christmas tree in 1889.^[80]

   Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to
   that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims
   that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at
   the Noden-Reed House,^[81] while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is
   also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly
   erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of Lancaster,
   Pennsylvania, recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading
   Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.^[82]
   Other accounts credit Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston, for
   being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a
   Christmas tree.^[83] In 1847, August Imgard, a German immigrant living in
   Wooster, Ohio cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the
   Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his
   house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.^[84]
   German immigrant Charles Minnigerode accepted a position as a professor of
--
   1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of
   the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of
   decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St.
   George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted
   Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.^[85] An 1853 article
   on Christmas customs in Pennsylvania defines them as mostly "German in
   origin", including the Christmas tree, which is "planted in a flower pot
   filled with earth, and its branches are covered with presents, chiefly of
   confectionary, for the younger members of the family." The article

   When Edward H. Johnson was vice president of the Edison Electric Light
   Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known

   1882. Johnson became the "Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights".^[87]

   The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune O Tannenbaum begin
   "O Christmas tree...", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the German
   word Tannenbaum (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for
   which is instead Weihnachtsbaum.

   that leveled the city of Halifax; and in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the

   thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen

  Setting up and taking down[edit]

   [IMG]Adding decorations to tree

   Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with
   specific dates; liturgically, this is done through the hanging of the
   greens ceremony.^[98] In many areas, it has become customary to set up
   one's Christmas tree on Advent Sunday, the first day of the Advent
   season.^[99]^[100] Traditionally, however, Christmas trees were not
   brought in and decorated until the evening of Christmas Eve (24 December),
   the end of the Advent season and the start of the twelve days of

   Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood,
   or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first
   decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries
   in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made
   in Lauscha, Germany, and also garlands of glass beads and tin figures that
   could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations fueled the
   production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay
   molds.

   Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used as
   Christmas tree decorations. Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced
   later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments
   were a specialty of the glass factories in the Thuringian Forest,
--
   coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
   Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom,
   fairy lights) is commonly done. A tree-topper, sometimes an angel but more
   frequently a star, completes the decoration.

   In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping
   strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance
   of a snow-laden tree.

   In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,
   flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There
   were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the
   1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

Symbolism and interpretations[edit]

   The earliest legend of the origin of a fir tree becoming a Christian
   symbol dates back to 723 AD, involving Saint Boniface as he was
   evangelizing Germany.^[107] It is said that at a pagan gathering in
   Geismar where a group of people dancing under a decorated oak tree were
   about to sacrifice a baby in the name of Thor, Saint Boniface took an axe
   and called on the name of Jesus.^[107] In one swipe, he managed to take
   down the entire oak tree, to the crowd's astonishment.^[107] Behind the
   fallen tree was a baby fir tree.^[107] Boniface said, "let this tree be
   the symbol of the true God, its leaves are ever green and will not die."
   The tree's needles pointed to heaven and it was shaped triangularly to
   represent the Holy Trinity.^[107]

   When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the
   top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem.^[7]^[108] It became
   popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order
   to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of
   Jesus.^[8] Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of
   Christmas, the evergreen Christmas tree symbolizes eternal life; the
   candles or lights on the tree represent Christ as the light of the
   world.^[6]^[109]

   Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and
   50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000
   growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same
   year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas
   trees.^[110] By 2016 that had climbed to $2.04 billion for natural trees
   and a further $1.86 billion for artificial trees. In Europe, 75 million
   trees worth €2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) are harvested annually.^[111]

     * Norway spruce Picea abies (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
     * Silver fir Abies alba
     * Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana

     * Serbian spruce Picea omorika
     * Scots pine Pinus sylvestris

     * Stone pine Pinus pinea (as small table-top trees)
     * Norfolk Island pine Araucaria heterophylla
     * Paraná pine Araucaria angustifolia (when young, resembles a Pine tree)

   Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional
   conifers are sometimes used, such as giant sequoia, Leyland cypress,
   Monterey cypress, and eastern juniper. Various types of spruce tree are
   also used for Christmas trees (including the blue spruce and, less
   commonly, the white spruce); but spruces begin to lose their needles
   rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making
   decorating uncomfortable. Virginia pine is still available on some tree
   farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is
   faded. The long-needled eastern white pine is also used there, though it
   is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to
   its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult
   with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes
   used, particularly in Oceania, and in Australia, some species of the
   genera Casuarina and Allocasuarina are also occasionally used as Christmas
   trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata Monterey
   pine. Adenanthos sericeus or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in
   southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. Hemlock species are
   generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor
   needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and
   ornaments.

   Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold
   live with roots and soil, often from a plant nursery, to be stored at
   nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often
--
   sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly,
   the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment
   of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's
   health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree
   out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put
   back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a
   large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the
   survival rate of these trees is low.^[112] However, when done properly,
   replanting provides higher survival rates.^[113]

   European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared
   trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often
   wild-harvested on public lands)^[114] there is a preference for
   close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang
   decorations.

   In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but
   now almost all are commercially grown on tree farms. Almost all Christmas
   trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they
   are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According
   to the United States Department of Agriculture's agriculture census for
   2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree
   market in America, 5,717.09 square kilometres (1,412,724 acres) were
   planted in Christmas trees.^[115]

   The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a 2-metre (7 ft) tree
   takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between eight
   and twelve years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from
   older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold
   to Christmas tree farms at an age of three to four years. The remaining
   development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as
   well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree
   farmer.^[116]

  Artificial trees[edit]

   Main article: Artificial Christmas tree
   [IMG]An artificial Christmas tree

   The first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the
   19th century,^[117]^[118]^[self-published source?] though earlier examples
   exist.^[119] These "trees" were made using goose feathers that were dyed
   green,^[117] as one response by Germans to continued deforestation.^[118]
   Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 5-centimeter
   (2 in) tree to a large 2.5-meter (98 in) tree sold in department stores
   during the 1920s.^[120] Often, the tree branches were tipped with
   artificial red berries which acted as candle holders.^[121]

   Over the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved
   and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created
   the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.^[122]
   Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree,^[118]
   first manufactured in Chicago in 1958,^[123] and later in Manitowoc,
   Wisconsin, where the majority of the trees were produced.^[124] Most
   modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used
   packaging materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC).^[118] Approximately
   10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin;
   despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or
   biodegradable.^[125]

   Other trends developed also in the early 2000s. Optical fiber Christmas
   trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas
   tree.^[126] One Dallas-based company offers "holographic mylar" trees in
   many hues.^[119] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as
   cardboard,^[127] glass,^[128] ceramic or other materials can be found in
   use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became
   popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing
   gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in
   retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.^[129]

   Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th
   century.^[118] Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are
   more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their
   natural alternative.^[118] They are also considered much safer,^[130] as
   natural trees can be a significant fire hazard. Between 2001 and 2007,
   artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to
   17.4 million.^[131] Currently, it is estimated that around 58% of
   Christmas trees used in the United States are artificial, while numbers in
   the United Kingdom are indicated to be around 66%.^[132]

Environmental issues[edit]

   The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing.
   Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more
   environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.^[131] However,
   trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, claim that
   the PVC used in Christmas trees is chemically and mechanically stable and
   does not affect human health and has excellent recyclable
   properties.^[133] Live trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted
   in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for
   wildlife.^[134] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock
   farmers who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are
   excellent fodder.^[135] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops
   can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of
   pesticides.^[136] Concerns have been raised by arborists about people
   cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana for
   Christmas trees.^[137]

   Real or cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and
   used as mulch, wildlife habitat, or used to prevent
   erosion.^[138]^[139]^[140] Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no
   more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb
   while growing.^[141] However, emissions can occur from farming activities
   and transportation. An independent life-cycle assessment study, conducted
   by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural
   tree will generate 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) of greenhouse gases every year (based
   on purchasing 5 km (3.1 mi) from home) whereas the artificial tree will
   produce 48.3 kg (106 lb) over its lifetime.^[142] Some people use living
   Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life
   cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented
   from local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while
   purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local
   tree adoption or urban reforestation services.^[143] Smaller and younger
   trees may be replanted after each season, with the following year running
   up to the next Christmas allowing the tree to carry out further growth.

   The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of
   concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study
   found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from
   lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major
   health risks to young children exist.^[144] A 2008 United States
   Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial
   Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.^[145] The report determined that
   of the fifty million artificial trees in the United States approximately
   twenty million were nine or more years old, the point where dangerous lead
   contamination levels are reached.^[145] A professional study on the
   life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed
   that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least twenty years to
   leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas
   tree.^[142]

Religious issues[edit]

   anti-religious campaign.^[146]^[147]^[88] The League of Militant Atheists
   encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among
   them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays,
   including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be
   the 31st of each month as a replacement.^[148] With the Christmas tree
   being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation,
   people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's
   trees.^[88]^[149] In 1935, the tree was brought back as New Year tree and
   became a secular, not a religious holiday.

   Pope John Paul II introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in
   1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the
   centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican Christmas Tree has become
   an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,^[150] and in 2005
   Pope Benedict XVI spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations
   in Catholic homes.^[151] In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree
   a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of
   life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and
   it reminds Christians of the "tree of life",^[152] an image of Christ, the
   supreme gift of God to humanity.^[153] In the previous year he said:
   "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds
   us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the
   desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand
   down in time the true meaning of Christmas."^[154] The Catholic Church's
   official Book of Blessings has a service for the blessing of the Christmas
   tree in a home.^[155] The Episcopal Church in The Anglican Family Prayer
   Book, which has the imprimatur of The Rt. Rev. Catherine S. Roskam of the
   Anglican Communion, has long had a ritual titled Blessing of a Christmas
   Tree, as well as Blessing of a Crèche, for use in the church and the home;
   family services and public liturgies for the blessing of Christmas trees
   are common in other Christian denominations as well.^[156]^[157]

   Chrismon trees, which find their origin in the Lutheran Christian
   tradition though now used in many Christian denominations such as the
   Catholic Church and Methodist Church, are used to decorate churches during
   the liturgical season of Advent; during the period of Christmastide,
   Christian churches display the traditional Christmas tree in their
   sanctuaries.^[158]

   In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the
   Boston Common a "Holiday Tree" rather than a "Christmas Tree".^[159] The
   name change was reversed after the city was threatened with several

       Christmas tree [...] originated in western Germany. The main prop of a
       popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with
       apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans
       set up a paradise tree in their homes on 24 December, the religious

       but it's a real reach to connect any of it to modern Christmas trees
       as we think of them. Scholars call this pareidolia – where we connect
       new data with something we already know about to make sense of it. We

       serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the
       locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree
       dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared
       Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a
       young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree
       was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the
       Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the
