   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   In mathematics, Kruskal's tree theorem states that the set of finite trees
   over a well-quasi-ordered set of labels is itself well-quasi-ordered under
   homeomorphic embedding.

   with a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion).

   In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the
   Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in
   reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function
--

   The version given here is that proven by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's
   formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite.

   Given a tree T with a root, and given vertices v, w, call w a successor of
   v if the unique path from the root to w contains v, and call w an
   immediate successor of v if additionally the path from v to w contains no
   other vertex.

   Take X to be a partially ordered set. If T_1, T_2 are rooted trees with
   vertices labeled in X, we say that T_1 is inf-embeddable in T_2 and write
   T_1 ≤ T_2 if there is an injective map F from the vertices of T_1 to the
--
       path from F(w_1) to F(w_2) in T_2 contains F(v).

   Kruskal's tree theorem then states:

     If X is well-quasi-ordered, then the set of rooted trees with labels in
     X is well-quasi-ordered under the inf-embeddable order defined above.
     (That is to say, given any infinite sequence T_1, T_2, … of rooted trees
     labeled in X, there is some i < j so that T_i ≤ T_j.)

Friedman's work[edit]

   For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and
   proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or
   the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the

   weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first
   observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the
   then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees
   above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has size
   one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR_0,^[1] thus
--
   impredicative proof.^[2] This case of the theorem is still provable by Π^1
   _1-CA_0, but by adding a "gap condition"^[3] to the definition of the
   order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem
   unprovable in this system.^[4]^[5] Much later, the Robertson–Seymour
   theorem would give another theorem unprovable by Π^1
--
   (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal).^[citation needed]

Weak tree function[edit]

   Suppose that P(n) is the statement:

           There is some m such that if T_1, ..., T_m is a finite sequence of
           unlabeled rooted trees where T_i has i + n vertices, then
           T_i ≤ T_j for some i < j.

--
   grows extremely quickly with n.

   Define tree(n), the weak tree function, as the largest m so that we have
   the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of unlabeled rooted trees, where
           each T_i has at most i + n vertices, such that T_i ≤ T_j does not
           hold for any i < j ≤ m.

   It is known that tree(1) = 2, tree(2) = 5, and tree(3) ≥ 844424930131960,
   tree(4) > Graham's number (by a lot) but TREE(3) (where the argument
   specifies the number of labels; see below) is larger than {\displaystyle
   \mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{\mathrm {tree}
   ^{\mathrm {tree} ^{8}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7)}(7).}

   To differentiate the two functions, "TREE" with all letters capitalized is
   the big TREE function and "tree" with all letters in lowercase is the weak
   tree function.

TREE function[edit]

   Sequence of trees where each node is colored either green, red, blueA
   sequence of rooted trees labelled from a set of 3 labels (blue < red <
   green). The nth tree in the sequence contains at most n vertices, and no
   tree is inf-embeddable within any later tree in the sequence. TREE(3) is
   defined to be the longest possible length of such a sequence.

   m so that we have the following:

           There is a sequence T_1, ..., T_m of rooted trees labelled from a
           set of n labels, where each T_i has at most i vertices, such that
           T_i ≤ T_j does not hold for any i < j ≤ m.
