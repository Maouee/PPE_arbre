                                   tree (n.)

   Old English treo, treow "tree" (also "timber, wood, beam, log, stake"),
   from Proto-Germanic *trewam (source also of Old Frisian tre, Old Saxon
   trio, Old Norse tre, Gothic triu "tree"), from PIE *drew-o-, suffixed
   variant form of root *deru- "be firm, solid, steadfast," with specialized

   In Old English and Middle English also "thing made of wood," especially

   gallows outside London). Middle English also had plural treen, adjective

   Baum, the usual words for "tree," see beam (n.).

   The meaning "framework of a saddle" is from 1530s. The meaning
   "representation of familial relationships in the form of a tree" is from
   c. 1300. Tree-hugger, contemptuous for "environmentalist" is attested by
   1989.

   boum, German Baum "tree," and perhaps also (with unexplained sound
