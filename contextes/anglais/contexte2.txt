What is a tree?

   We know trees are made of wood and have a trunk, branches and leaves,
   but how do we define what makes a tree… a tree?

   What is a tree?

   How do we define a tree and what makes it different from other forest
   plants and organisms? In this post, we look a little closer at the
   common characteristics of a tree and some of the science behind its
   shape, size and structure.

Definition of a tree

   As you know, there are many different tree species. However, they all
   share some key features that meet the criteria for what we understand
   to be a tree.

   Here's our simple definition:

   A tree is a tall plant that can live a very long time. It has a single
   stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a
   tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and
   nutrients the plant needs to grow.

   One way we distinguish trees from other plants is their thick and rigid
   ligneous tissues, which we know as wood. Of course, different tree
   species have different types of wood.

   Ultimately, while a basic definition of trees is helpful, as with all
   of nature, we must dig a bit deeper to understand the sheer variety of
   trees in the forest.

   Let's explore other features that make trees a unique and vital part of
   the natural environment, or start your journey as a tree owner by
   planting your first tree today.

Tree-height

   Some organisations prefer to define what makes a tree a tree by
   measuring height. The idea is to keep things simple, considering trees
   come in various forms and species with diverse and often localised
   characteristics.

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   definition says that for a plant species to be a tree, it should reach
   5m tall if the growing conditions are good. That's in developing
   countries – in developed countries, the height goes up to 7m.

   The National Forest Inventory (IFN) takes a similar approach. It
   defines a tree as a woody plant with a bare stem at its base and can
   grow to a height greater than or equal to 5m when it reaches maturity.

   Of course, some trees grow to truly incredible heights. The redwoods in
   California are the tallest trees on Earth and attract visitors from all
   over the world. They grow to over 90m in height–the tallest is
   Hyperion, reaching a massive 115m into the sky.

Anatomy of a tree

   Trees are perennial plants, meaning they live for many years- sometimes
   centuries or even several millennia for some species. While each
   species' life cycle differs, a tree's basic structure remains the same.

   A tree is also a plant with aerial (above-ground) parts, including the
   stem, leaves and flowers, and underground parts, its roots. Like any
   complex living organism, a tree is born, breathes, grows and reproduces
   before it dies if conditions and circumstances allow.

   In botany, trees and other woody plants are characterised by their
   secondary growth, which means their layers of tissue expand and their
   trunk gets wider. A tree is a plant that grows outwards and upwards.
   The extra width strengthens the tree to support its stem and roots.

Wood, leaves, fruit and flowers

   Most people associate trees with wood, leaves, fruit and flowers – the
   things we see outside. We generally have a good idea of ​​what a tree
   looks like, and we teach children to recognise trees from a young age.

   On the inside, wood is also called xylem, dead, thick cells that
   transport water and nutrients from the soil to the leaves. Xylem is
   connected to all other parts of the tree to form a continuous system
   that reaches throughout the plant and allows it to live and grow.

   While other plants produce wood, trees are defined by their large size
   and single, load-bearing trunk. Deciduous trees have leaves or needles
   that fall every winter or dry season, whereas foliage on evergreen
   trees stays green and functional for multiple years.

   Trees can grow flowers or fruit, which contain seeds that spread and
   allow them to reproduce. Each species has unique features, making trees
   crucial to rich, biodiverse habitats.
