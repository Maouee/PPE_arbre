   In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
   usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of
   a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
   plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In
   wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
   also trees.

   Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety
   of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
   way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of
   tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are
   gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching
   several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million
   years. It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees
   in the world.

   A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground
   by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and
   vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
   For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a
   protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out
   widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients
   from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and
   shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
   convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the
   tree's growth and development.

   Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but
   some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
   Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce
   spores instead.

   as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests are
   shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available
   for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have
   always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play
   a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Definition

   [IMG]Diagram of secondary growth in a eudicot or coniferous tree showing
   idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added
   in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots.

   Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally
   recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in
   common language.^[1]^[2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with
   the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the
   photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.^[3]
   Trees are also typically defined by height,^[4] with smaller plants from
   0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,^[5] so the minimum
   height of a tree is only loosely defined.^[4] Large herbaceous plants such
   as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.^[2]^[6]

   A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk
   formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by
   growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the
   growing tip.^[4]^[7] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as
   palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their
   height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered
   trees under a slightly looser definition;^[8] while the Joshua tree,
   bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood
   with growth rings,^[9]^[10] they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying
--
   despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem
   in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in
   dicotyledonous trees.^[12]

   Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for
   instance, as those plants which yield lumber.^[13]

   film, see The Saplings. For the episode, see Saplings (Weeds).

   The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different
   groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for
   sunlight.^[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,^[15] some reaching
   several thousand years old.^[16] Several trees are among the oldest
   organisms now living.^[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker
   stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and
--
   spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar
   growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;^[5]
   but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,^[18]
   made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under
   harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
   The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in
   response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example
   of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the
   number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living
   plant species.^[19]^[20] The greatest number of these grow in tropical
   regions; many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by
   botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.^[21]

   [IMG]Tall herbaceous monocotyledonous plants such as banana lack secondary
   growth, but are trees under the broadest definition.

   The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods. Of the rest,
   many are gymnosperms or softwood trees;^[22] these include conifers,
   cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales, which produce seeds which are not
   enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many
   have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.^[23] Most angiosperm trees
   are eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain
   two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old
   lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots;
   these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,^[24] while trees
   such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

   Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this
   supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows
   water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant,
   and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees,
   as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the
   xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the
   leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.^[25] The
   three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are
   integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living
   cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium
   allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
   Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also

   species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small
   leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.^[5] The crown is
   the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,^[29] while
   the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is
   known as the canopy.^[30] A sapling is a young tree.^[31]

   Many tall palms are herbaceous^[32] monocots, which do not undergo
   secondary growth and never produce wood.^[9]^[10] In many tall palms, the
   terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have
   unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree
   ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20
   metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which

   The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04
   trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics,
   0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the
   coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than
   previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over
   400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least
   because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate
   suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5
   billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human
   agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by
   46%.^[34]^[35]^[36]^[37] There are approximately 64,100 known tree species
   in the world. With 43% of all tree species, South America has the highest
   biodiversity, followed by Eurasia (22%), Africa (16%), North America
   (15%), and Oceania (11%).^[38]

   In suitable environments, such as the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland,
   or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand,
   forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end of
   a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by
   taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a

   Main article: Root

   The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and
   nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for
   reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.
   The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge
--
   taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots
   branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper
   layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and
   the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are
   single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil
--

   In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are
   known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree
   roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish
   in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and
   associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus
   from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of
   photosynthesis from the tree.^[51] The hyphae of the fungus can link
   different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and
   signals from one place to another.^[52] The fungus promotes growth of the
   roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can
   also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate
   heavy metals within its tissues.^[53] Fossil evidence shows that roots
   have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic,
--
   dry land.^[54]

   [IMG]Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)

   Some trees such as Alder (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship
   with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from
   the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules
   on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree
   to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to
   thrive.^[55] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule
   formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.^[56]

   It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their
   root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the
   inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal
   tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by
   injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking
   for its presence in neighbouring trees.^[57]

   The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree
   species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial
   roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of
   the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical
   stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that
   loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the
   mud.^[58] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.^[59] Many
   large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the
   trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide
   stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in
   tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the
   surface.^[60]

   Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in
   order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of
   excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are
--

   The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground,
   enabling the tree to overtop other plants and outcompete them for
   light.^[61] It also transports water and nutrients from the roots to the
   aerial parts of the tree, and distributes the food produced by the leaves
   to all other parts, including the roots.^[62]

--
   London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large
   flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off
   in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in
   circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In
   some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin
   which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is
   a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis)
   contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.^[62] Large
   tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales,
   Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos
   have different structures and outer coverings.^[64]

--
   the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery
   of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the
   tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried
   from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the
   growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards
   and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of
   nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were
   killed by this disease.^[65]

   The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in
   the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to
   other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some
   of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by
   parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for
--
   cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in
   colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts
   of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively
   converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The
   conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species. Heartwood
--
   of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the
   xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin,
   a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a
   horizontal core will show concentric circles of lighter or darker wood –
   tree rings.^[68] These rings are the annual growth rings^[69]^[70] There
   may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are
   vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the
   wood.^[68] Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright
   for many years.^[71]

--
   growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when
   conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive
   period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active
   growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the
   tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and
--
   a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand
   when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the
   leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the
   eucalyptus, have "naked buds" with no protective scales and some conifers,
   such as the Lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets
--
   unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms)
   have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.^[72] In some
   tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas
   growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss
   of early foliage to insect predators.^[73]
--
   the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium
   layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.^[74]
   Eventually the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no
   taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.^[75]

  Leaves
--

   Leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on
   the tree in such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without
   shading each other.^[76] They are an important investment by the tree and
   may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to
   discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes
--
   predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or
   entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The
   needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to
   those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments
   where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water
   availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher
   altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such
   as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling
   them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions
   deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get
   shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make
--
   called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the
   petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats
   to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their
   leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be
   replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other
   tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves
   annually, such as at the start of the dry season.^[77] Many deciduous
   trees flower before the new leaves emerge.^[78] A few trees do not have
   true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance
   such as Phylloclades – modified stem structures^[79] – as seen in the

   Trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects. Many
   angiosperm trees are insect pollinated. Wind pollination may take
   advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground.^[81] Trees use a
   variety of methods of seed dispersal. Some rely on wind, with winged or

   Main article: Seed

   Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary
   greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but
   the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest
   tree seeds.^[83] The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the
   many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their
   offspring.

   [IMG]Wind dispersed seed of elm (Ulmus), ash (Fraxinus) and maple (Acer)

   For a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light. If seeds
   only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated
   saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from
   flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to
   aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with
   blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The
   kapok tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.^[84]

   The seeds of conifers, the largest group of gymnosperms, are enclosed in a
--
   to high temperatures.^[87]

   The flame tree Delonix regia does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds
   through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart
   explosively on drying.^[84] The miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees
   produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the
   seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some
   species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start
   germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.^[88]^[89] These
   float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and
   successfully take root.^[84]

   animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the

   Further information: Evolutionary history of plants

   The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew
   in forests in the Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been
   Wattieza, fossils of which have been found in New York state in 2007
   dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to
   this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.^[96] Both of
   these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be
   links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic
--
   which took place about 319 million years ago.^[97] Ginkgophyta was once a
   widespread diverse group^[98] of which the only survivor is the maidenhair
   tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is
   virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic
   deposits.^[99]
--
   During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the conifers flourished
   and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats.
   Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the
   Cretaceous period. These began to displace the conifers during the
   Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the
   globe.^[100] When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first
   of four glacial periods occurred, the forests retreated as the ice
   advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been
   covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next glacial
   period.^[100]
--
   provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including
   animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the
   ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth,
   leaf litter, and decaying wood that provide other habitat.^[103]^[104]
   Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help
--
   maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.^[105]

   Many species of tree support their own specialised invertebrates. In their
   natural habitats, 284 different species of insect have been found on the
   English oak (Quercus robur)^[106] and 306 species of invertebrate on the
   Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua).^[107] Non-native tree species provide
   a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the
   sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has
--
   of lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.^[108] Trees differ
   ecologically in the ease with which they can be found by herbivores. Tree
   apparency varies with a tree's size and semiochemical content, and with
   the extent to which it is concealed by nonhost neighbours from its insect
   pests.^[109]

   In ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the
   habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of
   tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and
   creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus

   olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to
   make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica
   and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many
   rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for
   consumption.^[112] Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be
   described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These
   include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa),

   In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of sap at the end of the
   winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of
   the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a
   sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining
   10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is
   harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the
   liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse
   where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. Similarly in

   Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include cinnamon, made
   from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice,
   the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a
   seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and
   cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium
   aromaticum).^[116]

   from the roots of the sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).

   The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some
   can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes
   them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those
   of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (in Thai food)^[119] and Ailanthus (in
   Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus

   for flavouring food.^[116] Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a

   easily available material for construction since humans started building
--
   into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard,
   hardboard, chipboard and plywood.^[127] The wood of conifers is known as
   softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.^[128]

  Art

   Besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have been used to
   create art. Living trees have been used in bonsai and in tree shaping, and
   both living and dead specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic
   shapes.^[129]

    Bonsai

   [IMG]Informal upright style of bonsai on a juniper tree
   Main article: Bonsai

--
   there are similar practices in other cultures like the living miniature
   landscapes of Vietnam hòn non bộ. The word bonsai is often used in English
   as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.^[131]

   The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and
   the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).^[132]
   Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or
   more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting,
   seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development.
   Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or
   shrub species^[133] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to
   remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some

   Tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees and other woody
   plants into man made shapes for art and useful structures. There are a few
   different methods^[135] of shaping a tree. There is a gradual method and
   there is an instant method. The gradual method slowly guides the growing
   tip along predetermined pathways over time whereas the instant method
--
   becomes more rigid as they thicken up.^[136] Most artists use grafting of
   living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or functional structures and
   there are plans to grow "living houses" with the branches of trees
   knitting together to give a solid, weatherproof exterior combined with an
   interior application of straw and clay to provide a stucco-like inner
--
   Tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the
   oldest known examples being the living root bridges built and maintained
   by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using the roots of the rubber tree
   (Ficus elastica).^[137]^[138]

   Cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It
   is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an
   environmentally sustainable industry.^[139] More than half the world's
   cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine
--

   The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe
   for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been
   used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after
   various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats
--

   At least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of
   trees.^[142] Quinine originates from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was
   for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.^[143]
   Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the
   bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects.^[144] The
   anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in
   the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia).^[145] Other tree based
   drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the
   cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and
   the downy birch (Betula pubescens).^[142]

   The papery bark of the white birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used
   extensively by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes
   were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and

   compost.^[147]

  Ornamental trees

   Main article: Ornamental trees

   Trees create a visual impact in the same way as do other landscape
--
   fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a
   landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings
   of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living
   things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to
   year.^[148]

   Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as
   street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through
   evapotranspiration, absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept
   rainfall, and reduce the risk of flooding. Scientific studies show that
   street trees help cities be more sustainable, and improve the physical and
   mental wellbeing of the citizens.^[149] It has been shown that they are
   beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing
   stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.^[150] In
   London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street
   trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to
   one tree for every resident.^[151]

  Other uses

   [IMG]Latex collecting from a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)
   Further information: Resin, Latex, and Camphor

   Latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against
   herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the
   latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea
   brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the
   waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for
   which synthetic materials have proved less durable.^[152] The latex exuded
   by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is
   similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the "getah perca" tree
   Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea
   cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely
--
   Resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a
   viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile terpenes and is produced mostly
   by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings
   and in ten-pin bowling balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and
   the remaining product is called "rosin" and is used by stringed
--
   used in incense and aromatherapy. Fossilised resin is known as amber and
   was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more
   recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or
   spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.^[154]

   The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil^[116] and
   the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus
   oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.^[155]

Threats

  Individual trees

   Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe
   storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the
   presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and
   reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce
   building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water
   stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and
   insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating
   trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and
   death.^[156]

  Conservation

   About a third of all tree species, some twenty thousand, are included in
   the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Of those, over eight thousand are
   globally threatened, including at least 1400 which are classed as

   Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts,
   certain trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special
   significance^[158] as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental
   objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often
   linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as
   oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs who
   inhabited trees.

   The Oubangui people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As
   the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive,
   the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time
   for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the
   individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.^[159]

   Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended
   towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as
   a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens.
   In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and
   branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it.^[160] In
   India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that
   emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be
   worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the
   devout who tie threads round the trunk.^[161] Democracy started in North
   America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy,
   inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their
   weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus
   strobus).^[162] In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and
   the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of
   Eden.^[163]
--
   or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural
   penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the
   felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves may be
   the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater
   than the surrounding area.^[164] Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as
   Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or
   Kadambariyamman, associated with the cadamba tree, were seen as
   manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in
   abundance.^[165]
