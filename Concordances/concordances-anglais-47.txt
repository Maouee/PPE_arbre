you need to know about §tree§ data structures
you need to know about §tree§ data structures
when we start learning about §trees§ and graphs
what is a §tree§
examples of §trees§
how to implement §tree§ structures in code
structures than data structures like §trees§ and graphs
§trees§ are well-known as a
imagine a family §tree§ with relationships from all generation
family §trees§ hierarchically
1*masdc5dmuceu2abixqe45qmy family §tree§
drawing is is my family §tree§
works as a §tree§
a §tree§ is a collection of entities
the first node of the §tree§ is called the root
all §tree§ nodes are connected by links
of §trees§
the last nodes on a §tree§
real §trees§
the height of a §tree§ is the length of the
the topmost node of the §tree§
a child node in the §tree§
binary §trees§
discuss a specific type of §tree§
we call it thebinary §tree§
a binary §tree§ is a §tree§ data structure in which
an example of a binary §tree§
let’s code a binary §tree§
when we implement a binary §tree§ is
we implement a simple binary §tree§ that initializes with these three
our binary §tree§ class
§tree§
§tree§
print(§tree§.value
print(§tree§.left_child
print(§tree§.right_child
§tree§
summarize the illustration of this §tree§
the root of our binary §tree§
is the code for the §tree§
§tree§
we have to think about §tree§ traversal
algorithm for traversing or searching §tree§ data structure
algorithm for traversing or searching §tree§ data structure
it starts at the §tree§ root and explores the neighbor
let’s dive into each §tree§ traversal type
in-order algorithm for this §tree§ example is
post order algorithm for this §tree§ example is
bfs algorithm traverses the §tree§ level by level and depth
binary search §tree§
a binary search §tree§ is sometimes called ordered or
§trees§
§tree§ 7–5–8–6 needs
§tree§ 2–1–3 needs to
it satisfies the binary search §tree§
and the balance of the §tree§
adding new nodes to our §tree§
that we have an empty §tree§ and we want to add
is the root of our §tree§
§tree§
§tree§
§tree§
is how we defined the §tree§ insertion algorithm
§tree§ nodes will have smaller
§tree§ nodes will have
imagine that we have this §tree§
§tree§
§tree§
our §tree§ has the given value
t need to reorganize the §tree§
§tree§
§tree§
we will use this §tree§ to test our remove_node algorithm
