a §tree§ is also one of the
§tree§
the above §tree§ shows the organization hierarchy of
§tree§
is similar to the real §tree§
so it is named a §tree§
we can say that the §tree§ data structure is
some key points of the §tree§ data structure
a §tree§ data structure is defined as
a §tree§ data structure is a non
elements in a §tree§ are arranged in multiple levels
in the §tree§ data structure
above §tree§ structure
some basic terms used in §tree§ data structure
let's consider the §tree§ structure
§tree§
the topmost node in the §tree§ hierarchy
the root node of the §tree§
the node of the §tree§
§tree§
nodes present in a general §tree§
in the §tree§ shown in the above image
properties of §tree§ data structure
the §tree§ is also known as a
a §tree§ can be defined as recursively
distinguished node in a §tree§ data structure is known as
the root node of the §tree§ contains a link to all
§trees§
§tree§ is shown in the yellow
§tree§ is shown in the red
§tree§ can be further split into
§trees§ shown in three different
this recursive property of the §tree§ data structure is implemented
§tree§
on the properties of the §tree§ data structure
§trees§ are classified
implementation of §tree§
the §tree§ data structure can be created
the §tree§ in the memory can be
§tree§
shows the representation of the §tree§ data structure in
be defined for the binary §trees§ because the
binary §tree§ can have utmost two children
and generic §trees§ can have more
of the node for generic §trees§ would be
as compared to the binary §tree§
applications of §trees§
following are the applications of §trees§
§trees§ are used to store the
stored in the form of §trees§
a binary §tree§ has a logn time for
is a special kind of §tree§ that is used to store
it is also a §tree§ data structure implemented using arrays
b-§tree§ and b+§tree§
b-§tree§ and b+§tree§ are the §tree§ data structures
the §tree§ data structure is also used
types of §tree§ data structure
are the types of a §tree§ data structure
general §tree§
the general §tree§ is one of the types
of §tree§ data
in the general §tree§
in a general §tree§ is known as a root
§trees§
§tree§
of sub§trees§ in a general §tree§
§tree§
§trees§ are unordered as the nodes
§tree§ cannot be
every non-empty §tree§ has a downward edge
binary §tree§
in a binary §tree§
each node in a §tree§ can have utmost two child

binary search §tree§
binary search §tree§ is a non-linear data
search §tree§ with three fields
a binary search §tree§
§tree§ must contain a value less
§tree§ must be bigger than the

avl §tree§
the types of the binary §tree§
variant of the binary search §tree§
avl §tree§ satisfies the property of the
binary §tree§ as well as of the
binary search §tree§
binary search §tree§ that was invented by adelson
§tree§ and right
§tree§
we can consider a §tree§ as an avl §tree§ if
the §tree§ obeys the binary search
§tree§ as well as a balancing
§tree§ and the height of
§tree§
each node in the avl §tree§ should have the value of

red-black §tree§
the red-black §tree§ is the binary search §tree§
red-black §tree§ is that we should know
about the binary search §tree§
binary search §tree§
§tree§ should be less than the
§tree§ should be greater
operation is performed on the §tree§
we want our §tree§ to be
the red-black §tree§ is a self-balancing binary
search §tree§
avl §tree§ is
a height balancing binary search §tree§ then why do we require
red-black §tree§
in the avl §tree§
be required to balance the §tree§
but in the red-black §tree§
are required to balance the §tree§
of the §tree§
splay §tree§
the splay §tree§ data structure is also binary
search §tree§ in which recently
at the root position of §tree§ by performing some
a self-balancing binary search §tree§ having no explicit balance
condition like avl §tree§
that height of the splay §tree§ is not balanced
§trees§ may differ
operations in splay §tree§ takes order of logn time
splay §tree§ is a balanced §tree§ but it cannot be considered
balanced §tree§ because after each operation
leads to a balanced §tree§
data structure came from the §tree§ and heap data structure
comprises the properties of both §tree§ and heap data structures
search §tree§
§tree§ must be equal or less
§tree§ must be equal or
§trees§ contain larger keys than the
derived from the binary search §tree§ and priority is derived from
binary §tree§
§tree§ must be greater than the
b-§tree§
b-§tree§ is a balanced m-way
§tree§ where m defines the order
of the §tree§
only one key but b-§tree§ can have
in binary §tree§
but in b-§tree§
each node in a b-§tree§ can have maximum m children
