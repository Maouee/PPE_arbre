what's the oldest §tree§ on earth—and will it
§tree§ in chile is posing a
no nearby §trees§ to spread pathogens
long-lived §trees§
even when sections of the §tree§ die
percent of the §tree§ may be dead
§tree§-ring data
long believed that makes this §tree§ the planet’s oldest
unusual techniques to date a §tree§ of a
the claim has §tree§ researchers abuzz but skeptical
longest-lived §tree§ species
the early 1990s by counting §tree§ rings on a cut stump
alerce had been studying another §tree§ in a chilean

combining their core sample with §tree§-ring information
§tree§ was roughly 5,400 years
show that this patagonian cypress §tree§
it earth’s oldest living §tree§
mountain §tree§ ring research
oldest §trees§
brown doesn’t doubt the §tree§ is significant
to show the §tree§ was at least 2,400
the top 10 oldest §trees§ on brown’s list
§tree§ to date
to support the very oldest §trees§ and the surroundings of the
§trees§ can just keep on going
still argue about why some §trees§ are able to live so
contention is that §trees§ don’t necessarily die from
another alerce stump whose §tree§ rings can all be counted
argues that §tree§-ring data suggests alerce actually
the world’s longest-lived §trees§ and climate
the §tree§ in the early 1970s and
study the world’s oldest §trees§ are united by a common
barichivich’s chilean §tree§ now draws lots of tourists
which could threaten the §tree§’s water uptake
the entire §tree§ does not die—only the
bark to curl up the §tree§
usually see a super old §tree§ that has bark all the
portions of the §tree§ are now just really artistic
§trees§ are typically spaced far enough
these ancient §trees§
has killed millions of related §trees§
and bug infestations are killing §trees§ worldwide
planting §trees§ helps fight climate change—but
