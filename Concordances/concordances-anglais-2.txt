a coniferous §tree§
a §tree§ is a perennial plant with

§trees§ are not a monophyletic taxonomic
§tree§ species are angiosperms or hardwoods
§trees§ tend to be long-lived
§trees§ have been in existence for

a §tree§ typically has many secondary branches
from one part of the §tree§ to another
for most §trees§ it is surrounded by a

precise definition of what a §tree§ is
a §tree§ is any plant with
§trees§ are also typically defined by
height of a §tree§ is only loosely defined
as papaya and bananas are §trees§ in this broad sense
narrower definition is that a §tree§ has a woody trunk
and papayas are not considered §trees§ regardless of their
§trees§ under a slightly looser definition
while the joshua §tree§

§trees§ are commonly defined by use
the §tree§ growth habit is an evolutionary
§trees§ are able to compete better
§trees§ tend to be tall and
several §trees§ are among the oldest
§trees§ have modified structures such as
no consistent distinction between a §tree§ and a shrub
confusing by the fact that §trees§ may be reduced in size
the §tree§ form has evolved separately in
number of §trees§ worldwide might total twenty-five
making §tree§ diversity and ranges poorly known
but are §trees§ under the broadest definition
the majority of §tree§ species are angiosperms or hardwoods
many are gymnosperms or softwood §trees§
most angiosperm §trees§
there are also some §trees§ among the old

large §trees§ have buttress roots which flare
these brace the §tree§ rather like angle brackets and
some §tree§ species have developed root extensions
