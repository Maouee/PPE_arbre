some tips for reading phylogenetic §trees§
you may see phylogenetic §trees§ drawn in many different formats
like the §tree§ at left below
§tree§ at right below
you may also see §trees§ of either kind oriented
as shown for the blocky §tree§
three examples of phylogenetic §trees§
the first §tree§ is horizontal with a
the second §tree§ is similar to the first
§tree§
the third §tree§ is similar to the second

the three §trees§ above represent identical relationships among
are different between the two §trees§
information in these different-looking §trees§ reminds us that

another critical point about these §trees§ is that if you rotate
