a §tree§ can be seen as a
decision §trees§ learn from data to
deeper the §tree§
§tree§
some advantages of decision §trees§ are
§trees§ can be visualized
some §tree§ and algorithm combinations support
the cost of using the §tree§
points used to train the §tree§
the disadvantages of decision §trees§ include
decision-§tree§ learners can create over-complex
§trees§ that do not
the maximum depth of the §tree§ are necessary to
decision §trees§ can be unstable because small
result in a completely different §tree§ being generated
is mitigated by using decision §trees§ within an ensemble
predictions of decision §trees§ are neither smooth nor continuous
of learning an optimal decision §tree§ is known to be
practical decision-§tree§ learning algorithms
return the globally optimal decision §tree§
be mitigated by training multiple §trees§ in an ensemble learner
hard to learn because decision §trees§ do
decision §tree§ learners create biased §trees§ if some classes dominate
with the decision §tree§
from sklearn import §tree§
§tree§.decision§tree§classifier
we can construct a §tree§ as follows
from sklearn import §tree§
§tree§.decision§tree§classifier
you can plot the §tree§ with the plot_§tree§ function
§tree§.plot_§tree§(clf
alternative ways to export §trees§ click for more details
we can also export the §tree§ in graphviz format using the
graphviz export of the above §tree§ trained on the
§tree§.export_graphviz(clf
§tree§.export_graphviz(clf
the §tree§ can also be exported in

decision §tree§ is fit on an output
the use of multi-output §trees§ for regression is demonstrated in
multi-output decision §tree§ regression
§tree§
the use of multi-output §trees§ for classification is demonstrated in
subwindows and multiple output randomized §trees§
to construct a balanced binary §tree§ is
although the §tree§ construction algorithm
attempts to generate balanced §trees§
§trees§ remain approximately balanced
total cost over the entire §trees§
decision §trees§ tend to overfit on data
since a §tree§ with few samples in high
beforehand to give your §tree§ a better chance of finding
understanding the decision §tree§ structure will help in gaining
insights about how the decision §tree§ makes predictions
visualize your §tree§ as you are training by
max_depth=3 as an initial §tree§ depth to get a feel
how the §tree§ is fitting to your data
samples required to populate the §tree§
for each additional level the §tree§ grows to
control the size of the §tree§ to prevent overfitting
inform every decision in the §tree§
§tree§ will overfit
large number will prevent the §tree§ from
before training to prevent the §tree§ from being
be easier to optimize the §tree§
all decision §trees§ use np.float32 arrays internally
