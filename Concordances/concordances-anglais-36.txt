undirected graph is a §tree§
data structures referred to as §trees§ in computer
have underlying graphs that are §trees§ in graph theory
data structures are generally rooted §trees§
a rooted §tree§ may be
called a directed rooted §tree§

a labeled §tree§ is a §tree§ in which each vertex is

a recursive §tree§ is a labeled

a §tree§ with no vertices
a k-ary §tree§
is a rooted §tree§ in which each
2-ary §trees§ are often called binary
