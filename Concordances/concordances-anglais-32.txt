red black §tree§
a §tree§ data structure is a hierarchical
the topmost node of the §tree§ is called the root
also say that §tree§ data structure has roots
the topmost node of a §tree§ or the node which does
§tree§
a non-empty §tree§ must contain exactly one root
all other nodes of the §tree§
of the §tree§
§tree§
any node of the §tree§ along with its descendant
representation of §tree§ data structure
a §tree§ consists of a root
§trees§ t_1
from the root of the §tree§ to the root of each

types of §trees§ in data structure based on
binary §tree§
in a binary §tree§
some common types of binary §trees§ include full
binary §trees§
complete binary §trees§
balanced binary §trees§
degenerate or pathological binary §trees§
ternary §tree§
a ternary §tree§ is a §tree§ data structure in which each
n-ary §tree§ or generic §tree§
generic §trees§ are a collection of nodes

a leaf node of the §tree§
height of the §tree§
the height of a §tree§ is the length of the
from the root of the §tree§ to a leaf node of
the §tree§
§trees§ attached to that node is
the degree of a §tree§ is the maximum degree of
nodes in the §tree§
need for §tree§ data structure
one reason to use §trees§ might be because you want
that involves constructing a binary §tree§ where the leaves
§tree§ is used to encode the
a syntax §tree§ is used to
b-§trees§ and other §tree§ structures are used in
advantages of §tree§ data structure
§tree§ offer efficient searching depending on
the type of §tree§
for balanced §trees§ like avl
§trees§ provide a hierarchical representation of
the recursive nature of §trees§ makes them easy to traverse
disadvantages of §tree§ data structure
unbalanced §trees§
that the height of the §tree§ is skewed
§trees§ demand more memory space requirements
especially if the §tree§ is
the implementation and manipulation of §trees§ can be complex and
