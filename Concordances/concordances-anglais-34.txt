kruskal's §tree§ theorem
kruskal's §tree§ theorem states that the set
of finite §trees§
the result was generalized from §trees§ to graphs as the
all §trees§ we consider are finite
given a §tree§ t with a root
t_2 are rooted §trees§ with
kruskal's §tree§ theorem then states
then the set of rooted §trees§ with labels in
of rooted §trees§
kruskal's §tree§ theorem can be expressed and
in the case where the §trees§
