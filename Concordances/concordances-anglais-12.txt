a parse §tree§ or parsing §tree§
or derivation §tree§ or concrete syntax
§tree§ is an ordered
rooted §tree§ that represents the syntactic structure
the term parse §tree§
the term syntax §tree§ is more common
concrete syntax §trees§ reflect the syntax of the
distinct from the abstract syntax §trees§ used in computer programming
§trees§ do not use distinct symbol
parse §trees§ are usually constructed based on
parse §trees§ may be generated

a parse §tree§ is made up of nodes
parse §tree§ is the entire structure
in a parse §tree§
of the §tree§
branch in that §tree§ whereas a terminal function is
parse §tree§ which is a leaf
for binary §trees§
the number of possible parse §trees§ for a sentence with n
constituency-based parse §trees§[edit
the constituency-based parse §trees§ of constituency grammars
represents a constituency-based parse §tree§
parse §tree§ psg
the parse §tree§ is the entire structure
used in the §tree§
each node in the §tree§ is either a root node
§tree§
by a branch of a §tree§
dependency-based parse §trees§[edit
the dependency-based parse §trees§ of dependency grammars
constituency-based parse §trees§ because they contain fewer nodes
dependency-based parse §tree§ for the example sentence above

this parse §tree§ lacks the phrasal categories
like the constituency-based §tree§
any complete sub-§tree§ of the §tree§
thus this dependency-based parse §tree§ acknowledges the

presented in the form of §trees§
