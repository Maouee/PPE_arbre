§trees§
a §tree§ is a mathematical structure that
since a §tree§ data
giving a §tree§ graph
§trees§ were first studied by cayley
§trees§ up to 18 vertices
a §tree§ is a set of straight
a §tree§ with n nodes has n
n-1 edges is a §tree§
all §trees§ are bipartite graphs
§trees§ with no particular node singled
sometimes called free §trees§
or unrooted §tree§
them from rooted §trees§
at their ends are called §tree§ leaves
a §tree§
and with one or two §tree§ leaves at the end
branch is called a binary §tree§
see if it is a §tree§ using
§tree§
§trees§ are block graphs
a §tree§ t has either one node
called a centered §tree§
it is called a bicentered §tree§
is designated to turn a §tree§ into a rooted §tree§
in such a §tree§
that there is only one §tree§ of order 3
of nonisomorphic §trees§ of order n=1
where §trees§
for the number of rooted §trees§
for the number of unrooted §trees§
is the number of nonisomorphic §trees§ on n nodes
